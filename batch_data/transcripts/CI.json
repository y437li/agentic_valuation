[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the question-and-answer session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Ted Detrick. Please go ahead, Mr. Detrick. Edwin J. Detrick: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ted Detrick, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's first quarter 2014 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for full year 2014. Now as noted in our earnings release, Cigna uses certain financial measures, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP, when describing our financial results. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as the principal measures of performance for Cigna and our business segments. And a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. Now on our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2014 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of the risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note in today's earnings release and our most recently filed reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. First, beginning this quarter, in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement, we have combined the results of the Run-off Reinsurance, Other Operations and Corporate segments into one reporting unit called Corporate and Other Operations. This change to simplify our reporting was enabled by Cigna's exit of the Run-off Reinsurance business in 2013. We have revised our prior period results to conform to this current presentation, and as a result of this reporting change, there is no change to our historical results. On a separate point, please note that when we discuss the number of covered lives for our global medical customers, we will be doing so on a basis that excludes those individuals that were previously covered under Limited Benefits plans. As a reminder, we exited the Limited Benefits business as of December 31, 2013, due to ACA regulation. And lastly, I would note that when we discuss our earnings outlook for 2014, it will be on the basis of adjusted income from operations. And in addition, our outlook for earnings per share for 2014 excludes the effects of any future capital deployment. And on that basis, I will turn the call over to David. David M. Cordani: Thanks, Ted. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'll begin today with a review of our first quarter performance and highlights of our financial results. And I'll offer our perspective on how we are anticipating and adapting to the ongoing evolution of the business environment. Then I will discuss how we are developing personalized and localized solutions that improve quality and affordability through Cigna's Collaborative Care initiatives. These actions ultimately translate into differentiated value for our customers and clients and, as a result, greater value for our shareholders. Next, Tom will provide specifics on our performance and highlight our outlook for the year before we open the floor to your questions. After that, I'll leave you with a few closing remarks. Let's get started with some highlights. The first quarter 2014 continues our track record of strong performance and begins a new year of delivering competitively attractive financial results. Our results this quarter once again reflects strong contributions from each of our businesses. The first quarter 2014 consolidated revenues increased to $8.5 billion. We reported adjusted income from operations for the first quarter of $501 million or $1.83 per share, which represents a per share increase of 6% over a very strong first quarter of 2013. Turning to each of our segments. In the Global Health Care area, we continue to drive strong results across our targeted markets. Our focus on continued high-quality clinical outcomes is driving favorable medical costs for our customers and clients, with the vast majority of our clients directly benefiting from these results through our transparent funding arrangements. These outcomes are helping us grow and deepen our relationships with more medical customers globally through a combination of retaining customers and continuing to add new ones. In addition, our first quarter results also underscore the good progress we have made on our remediation efforts to address the claims pressure in our U.S. Seniors business. Our Global Supplemental Benefit business continued its strong performance as we capitalize on our differentiated marketing and distribution capabilities in our targeted geographies. In our Group Disability and Life segment, our results reflect strong performance and business growth in the midst of an improving but still challenging economic environment. Overall, this quarter's results were once again driven by our focused strategy, effective execution and differentiated capabilities that create value for Cigna's stakeholders. Our performance for the first quarter gives us confidence that we will achieve our increased 2014 outlook. An essential element of Cigna's sustained ability to deliver strong results in this dynamic and rapidly changing environment has been our focused strategy of Going Deep, Going Global, and Going Individual, which allows us to effectively target subsegments of the market where we can create competitively superior value for customers and clients based on our differentiated capabilities. We do this around the world, fueled by our global footprint, which is unique in our industry, with operations in more than 30 countries and jurisdictions. As part of our Go Deep strategy, we place a continued emphasis on localizing our initiatives in our global markets, harnessing analytics and the customer insights they generate to deliver products and services that are personally relevant and adaptable to the unique needs of our target customers and clients. We do all of this in close consultation with clients and distribution partners and in collaboration with our health care delivery partners. Cigna's ability to work collaboratively to help to improve health outcomes and reduce costs is of critical importance as many systems around the world remain challenged. Highlight the magnitude of the opportunity in the U.S., recent studies, including those from the Institute of Medicine, have shown a majority of the patients are not receiving evidence-based clinical care. And nearly 1/3 of all medical costs are spent on unnecessary services that do not improve health outcomes. Research also indicates that positive health outcomes are stagnating, while costs increase due to a singular focus on volume that puts tremendous pressure on the entire health care system. At Cigna, our emphasis on collaboration and personalization of care has driven us to create a model that encourages the highest levels of quality and affordability through aligned incentives with our physician partners. Our approach combined these aligned incentives with specific actionable information and care extenders, including health coaches and case managers, to provide individualized local support. Given our proven success in collaborative arrangements with large physician groups, in the first quarter, we announced an expansion of our value-based initiatives to better serve a large subset of our customers with high-risk conditions and complex needs, who seek care from small physician groups as well as hospital facilities. We have also expanded our collaborative programs to include targeted specialist groups, where our focus is on 5 specialties to compromise -- comprise nearly 60% of all medical spending, such as oncology as well as obstetrics, where our advanced Healthy Pregnancy, Healthy Babies program enables more full-term natural deliveries and helps mothers and babies stay healthy during pregnancy as well as following birth. Our latest analysis shows that our most mature Cigna Collaborative Care arrangements have delivered quality performance and total medical costs that are superior to market averages. For example, we are encouraging these urgent care facilities and offering extended office hours, which helps reduce unnecessary emergency room visits by up to 50%. We have closed 21% more guests in care, thanks in part to our embedded care coordinators who helped with prescription adherence and work to ensure continuity of care for our customers. And one of our initiatives recently demonstrated a diabetic compliance rate, which is over 20% better than market average. Today, the scale of our efforts is significant. These programs encompass more than 1.3 million customers in 31 states, with over 63,000 doctors, including more than 24,000 primary care physicians and nearly 40,000 specialists. Our commitment to affordable and superior health outcomes for our customers and the ongoing innovation we continue to drive is one of the key ways Cigna continues to deliver differentiated value and ensure superior competitive positioning for the future. As we look ahead, we recognize we are operating in a dynamic global environment, characterized by existing and emerging disruptions that create formidable business challenges as well as opportunities. As we have discussed in the past, Medicare Advantage programs will face disruption. We believe our strong U.S. Seniors footprint and leading physician engagement capabilities positions us for a long-term success in this growing segment. While global markets remain fluid, our focused strategy, differentiated capabilities and competitively differentiated global footprint positions Cigna for sustained long-term growth. For the full year 2014, we are confident that each of our business segments will deliver continued growth. In addition, our businesses are producing strong returns on capital, giving us the flexibility to create additional shareholder value through capital deployment opportunities. Taking these items into account, we remain committed to our long-term average annual EPS growth target of 10% to 13%. Now to briefly summarize my remarks before turning it over to Tom. Cigna's strong financial performance during the first quarter marks another quarter of competitively attractive earnings and revenue growth and provides a strong start to 2014. Our strong balance sheet and high levels of free cash flow give us flexibility to deliver additional shareholder value. In this disrupted environment, Cigna is leading through change, ensuring that our customers, clients and shareholders will benefit from the value of our differentiated capabilities and focused strategy execution. Within that environment, we have demonstrated proven capabilities with our physician collaboratives to deliver outstanding clinical and affordability outcomes. And now I'll turn the call over to Tom for a more detailed look at our results and outlook. Tom? Thomas A. McCarthy: Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's first quarter 2014 results and discuss our outlook for the full year. We've had a very strong start to the year, driven by continued effective execution of our strategy, with significant contributions from each of our business segments. Some key highlights from the quarter include consolidated revenues grew to $8.5 billion, driven by continued growth in our targeted markets. Consolidated earnings were $501 million. Quarterly earnings per share were $1.83, representing growth of 6% over the first quarter of 2013. And free cash flow was strong, and we returned $650 million to shareholders through share repurchases on a year-to-date basis. Overall, the strength of our first quarter performance provides us with solid momentum for the year. Regarding the segments, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Global Health Care results were strong in both our Commercial and Seniors books of business. First quarter premium and fees for Global Health Care grew 3% to $6 billion. This reflects continued good growth in our Commercial business, partially offset by the expected reimbursement reduction in our Seniors business and our exit from the Limited Benefits business. We ended first quarter 2014 with 14.2 million global medical customers, growing by 90,000 customers. First quarter earnings grew 3% to $439 million and were driven by revenue growth and specialty contributions, as well as favorable medical costs across both our Commercial Employer and Seniors businesses. Turning now to medical costs. As David indicated, we continued to improve health outcomes for the benefit of our customers, driven by engagement with physicians and value-based solutions for our customers and clients. Our commercial medical cost trend continues to be among the lowest in the industry. And given that 85% of our U.S. Commercial customers are in transparent ASO funding arrangements, our clients directly benefit from these favorable medical costs. Regarding medical care ratios, in our U.S. Commercial Guaranteed Cost business, our first quarter 2014 medical care ratio, or MCR, was 76.1% on a reported basis or 78% excluding prior year reserve development. Our Guaranteed Cost results reflect continued favorable medical costs within our Employer business. Overall, we are pleased with the results of our commercial risk businesses, which continued to reflect strong pricing, disciplined underwriting and continued effective medical management and physician engagement. In our Seniors business, our first quarter MCR for Medicare Advantage was 82.7% on a reported basis or 84.1% excluding prior year reserve development. First quarter Medicare Advantage results were better than expected, with good early progress on the network and medical management actions we discussed last quarter to improve medical costs for our Seniors business. Across our Commercial and Seniors risk books of business, our first quarter earnings included favorable prior year reserve development of $30 million after tax compared to $48 million after tax in the first quarter of 2013. Moving to operating expenses. For the first quarter of 2014, the total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 21.9%, which reflects the impact of the industry fee, which added 110 basis points to the expense ratio in the quarter, as well as efficiency gains and some favorable timing impacts. To recap, we've had a strong start to 2014 in our Global Health Care business. Now I will discuss the results of our Global Supplemental Benefits business, which continues to deliver attractive growth and profitability. Premiums and fees grew 13% quarter-over-quarter for Global Supplemental. First quarter earnings were $53 million, reflecting strong customer retention, business growth and effective operating expense management with some modest claim pressure in South Korea. For Group Disability and Life, first quarter results were strong, with premium and fee increases of 7% over first quarter 2014. First quarter earnings in our group business increased to $67 million, driven by business growth as well as lower benefit and operating expense ratios. For our Corporate and Other Operations, results totaled to an after-tax loss of $58 million for the first quarter of 2014. Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, our first quarter results reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from each of our business segments, as well as continued significant free cash flow. Turning to our investment portfolio. In the first quarter, we recognized net realized investment gains of $27 million after tax, coupled with a strong net investment income result. We continue to be pleased with the quality and diversification of our investment portfolio. Now I will discuss our outlook for 2014. We expect to continue to deliver differentiated value for our customers and clients and strong financial performance for our shareholders in 2014. We continue to expect consolidated revenues to grow in the range of 4% to 7% over 2013. Our outlook for full year 2014 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $1.93 billion to $2 billion or $7.05 to $7.35 per share. This represents an increase of $0.20 per share at the midpoint over our previous expectations. Consistent with past practice, our outlook excludes any contribution from additional capital deployment and any additional prior year reserve development. I will now discuss the components of our 2014 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $1.61 billion to $1.64 billion, an increase over our prior expectations. This increased outlook for Global Health Care primarily reflects first quarter favorable prior year reserve development, strong execution in both our Commercial Employer and Seniors businesses, with some offsets from the current outlook for our U.S. Individual business and the spending pattern of operating expenses for the remainder of the year. I'll now summarize some of the key assumptions reflected on our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2014, starting with our customer base. Regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect 2014 customer growth of approximately 1% to 2%. Turning to medical costs. Our 2014 outlook continues to assume some increase in medical utilization versus current levels. For our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we continue to expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 5% to 6%. This strong medical cost trend result delivers value for our customers and clients across our broad array of funding types. Turning now to our medical care ratio outlook. We are pleased with the performance of our overall Commercial Guaranteed Cost book of business, particularly the Commercial Employer component of our Guaranteed Cost book. As a result, the MCR outlook for the -- our employer book remains unchanged. We are, however, increasing our outlook for our U.S. Individual book of business MCR based on our early view of results. Taken together, the 2014 medical care ratio for our U.S. Commercial Guaranteed Cost book of business is now in the range of 81% to 82.5%. For context, while our U.S. Individual business is growing in 2014, it will approximate 3% of enterprise revenues. As a result, we continue to expect the impact of the -- of this business will be manageable within our overall diversified portfolio. For our Seniors business, our Medicare Advantage MCR for 2014 continues to be in the range of 84% to 85%. Regarding operating expenses for 2014, we continue to expect our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%. We expect the operating expense favorability that we saw in the first quarter to be offset over the balance of the year by increased spending on strategic investments and some expense timing impact. Overall, we expect full year 2014 Global Health Care earnings to be approximately $1.61 billion to $1.64 billion. The other components of our outlook are unchanged. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth and earnings in the range of $195 million to $215 million. Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we continue to expect full year 2014 earnings in the range of $305 million to $325 million. Regarding our remaining operations, that is, Corporate and Other Operations, we continue to expect a loss of $175 million for 2014. So all in, for full year 2014, we have increased our outlook for consolidated adjusted income from operations to a range of approximately $1.93 billion to $2 billion or $7.05 to $7.35 per share. This represents an increase of $0.20 per share at the midpoint, building on a strong 2013. Now moving to our 2014 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have good financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with a strong return on capital [indiscernible] of our business segments. Our capital deployment strategy and priorities have not changed. These priorities are : providing the capital to support the growth of our ongoing operations; pursuing M&A activity with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow in our targeted areas of focus; and after considering these first 2 items, we would return capital to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase. Regarding free cash flow, we ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $475 million. During the period February 7 through April 30, we repurchased 5.4 million shares of Cigna common stock for $425 million, bringing our total year-to-date share repurchase to 8 million shares for $650 million. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we now expect to have approximately $1.25 billion available for deployment during the balance of the year. This represents a $100 million increase compared to our previous capital outlook. Overall, our financial position and capital outlook remains strong. The high returns on capital from our businesses, coupled with our strong balance sheet, means that we will continue to generate significant free cash flow to deploy for the benefit of the shareholders. Now to recap, our first quarter 2014 consolidated results reflect the strength of our diversified portfolio of global businesses and continued effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals in our businesses remains strong, as evidenced by our first quarter results, which reflected attractive growth and revenue earnings, favorable medical costs that directly benefit our customers and clients and continued strong free cash flow. Based on the strength of these results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year 2014 earnings outlook. With that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank. Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : First question, just relative to the improved HealthSpring results in the first quarter, can you talk about how that broke down between seeing less claim severity possibly relative to the back half of the year, what you're seeing just in terms of general utilization trends at MA and then compare that relative to the actual company-specific initiative that you put in place to help improve results? So really looking at sort of how much was the broader environment as compared to the company-specific initiatives that you've now been putting in place. David M. Cordani: It's David. I'll give you a little color there. First, to headline, we're pleased with the results and the progress that the first quarter demonstrated. When we take a look at the results to highlight a few items, one, clearly, the fourth quarter of last year matured favorably versus expectations. So that contributed to reported results, but it also contributed to a jump-off. I'll come back to that in a moment. Secondly, we're seeing some positive impact in the first quarter relative to our own performance from the contributions of the benefit positioning we've put in place for 2014. And third, specifically, we are seeing an impact of some of the target remediation efforts we embarked upon, whether it's the targeted recontracting in key markets, some network optimization or some additional focused medical management activity. So I would suggest that from our point of view, we're pleased with the results, and the results we're demonstrating here are primarily driven by own actions. Stepping back, a little bit more color. Year-over-year, what we know is the flu season was less severe in the first quarter of '14 than it was in the first quarter of '13. So that's an industry event. And finally, at least from our point of view, given the markets we operate in, as best we can understand, we did a de minimis impact to the weather from an overall operation. So maybe a little bit less utilization in the first quarter tied to the flu. The rest of it is broadly driven by some of our actions. Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay, got it. Then just the follow-up question, just following up on Tom highlighting that you're increasing the MLR expectations for the Individual business. Just if you can walk through some more color on that and just interested in how much of that is affected by what you're seeing on the exchange and expectations in terms of profitability there as compared to in the existing Individual business and, I guess, relative to some of the unexpected policy changes that developed over 2014. Thomas A. McCarthy: Thanks, Scott. It's Tom. First, before we get to the specifics under Individual, I do want to step back and remind you that we're still very happy with the overall fundamentals of our risk business. They've been strong in the quarter and have been for some time reflecting the disciplined pricing and underwriting and strong clinical management and physician engagement capabilities. And in case you missed it, we are not changing the MCR outlook for our Employer business. All of the change in our Guaranteed Cost to MCR outlook does relate to Individual. A few points to make here. Our early claim experience for this business and a cautious view on recoveries from risk adjusters in risk quarters has caused us to increase our view of the Individual MCR for the full year. So that really is the driver, some caution seen in the early claims experience and uncertainty about what the future looks like. I'd also point out to you that while Individual is a small portion of our overall business, it represents a growing share of our Guaranteed Cost business. It's about -- now about 25% to 30% of our total Guaranteed Cost business. So again, the uncertainty on the MCR outlook and the growing share of the overall Guaranteed Cost book is what's caused us to increase the GC MCR. And I would also remind you that in the context of our overall company, Individual is still small, representing about 3% of our total revenues. Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And, Tom, just to clarify, the early experience where you're seeing some of these higher claims, that's on the new exchange lives that are coming in? Thomas A. McCarthy: I'd say it's the new ACA lives, so both ACI-compliant policies on exchange and off exchange. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Just, Tom, could you quantify the favorable operating expense? I think you mentioned the timing impact. Just want to see exactly what that was and what the impact on the quarter was relative to expectation. Thomas A. McCarthy: Yes, Josh. I don't think I want to get into the specific timing. We have a few things going on in expenses in the quarter. First, we kind of have the ramp-up over the year of strategic spend. So I think you know we're launching our duals project in Illinois. We've got the India launch in Global Sup. We also have timing of some IT portfolio spend and the -- some specific timing on hiring ramp-up that we might have over the course of the year. If you look at the impact of the favorable results in the quarter, it's pretty evenly mixed between the medical cost, the expense savings and the continued strong revenue contributions from our businesses. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay, [indiscernible] quantification. And then could you talk a little about private exchanges? I mean, did you guys see anything in terms of net gains or losses in the first quarter in 2014, any of your customers sort of discussing the opportunities for private exchanges? I know you guys have your own initiatives in-house? I'm just curious, did you -- were you guys sort of net winners or losers on private exchanges? And where do you think that goes this year? David M. Cordani: Josh, it's David. Well, let me give you a little color. First, just to frame our view of the private exchanges and then I'll tell -- I'll get right to your -- the heart of your question. As we've discussed in the past, we view that the private exchange environment is still in the early phases of adoption and clearly may create a very attractive sustainable marketplace for time to come, leveraging some retail purchasing environment and transparency. A little color to think about in terms of as you know, there's a lot of different private exchange models. So retiree versus active, single carrier versus multi-carrier, highly localized versus broader rating areas, employer remaining involved versus employer not remaining involved and lastly, pooled funding versus transparent funding. To date, our experience is around our participation in many of those models, including our own proprietary exchange. Today, our target clients have continued to reinforce a desire to stay engaged, have more personalization and localization and maintain more transparent funding arrangements. The net of all of that, through our experience, has been de minimis, meaning puts and takes, wins and losses, relatively small volumes and a relatively small net movement within the portfolio. Important in your question is around dialogue. There's a lot of dialogue because this is a new mechanism. So clients and prospects are wanting to learn more in terms of what are the value creators both in year 1 as well as sustainability of the value creators, and we're actively engaged in those conversations. But I think the important headline is heretofore de minimis impact to our business in terms of the net puts and takes. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : And, David, is there actually been more specific, I was looking more on the active employees. So I don't know if there's sort of puts and takes, you're doing better on one, retiree versus active? Is there a difference between those 2 platforms? David M. Cordani: Yes, I appreciate the clarification. Net-net, no. The aggregate puts and takes for our organization, again, whether I look at the retiree environment, whether I look at the active medical, whether I look at the specialty components, it's all netting to a very small number right now. Having said that from my comments, you should take away that we're active in engaging in multiple as the models, and we're active in kind of exploring additional value creators for the benefit of clients and customers. But to date, both active and retiree is relatively small. Operator : The next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Just want to go back, the 100 basis point increase in Guaranteed Cost MLR seems pretty large in the context of how small your just sort of Individual book is. And if it is coming from exchange, it would obviously suggest significantly higher costs there. So hoping you can give us more details on the risk of business that you brought on or the people that are signing up much sicker than you would have expected, age cohorts, if you have that detail or if it's your sense that across the board, just the population that's on the exchanges just were soft across the board relative to just your existing book. David M. Cordani: Ralph, it's David. Let me try to give you a little bit of color. Just 2 sets of comments : one, put the size in context; two, the early experience. So when you think about the size, as Tom referenced earlier, is Guaranteed Cost represents a smaller portion of our overall portfolio. And we look at Guaranteed Cost going into 2014. As you know, we have the impact in terms of lives of running off the Limited Benefit business. So the aggregate number of lives and Guaranteed Cost decreases and then the growth in the Individual business. And Tom referenced, while the Individual business is about 3% of our enterprise revenue, it's in the 25% range of the guaranteed cost environment. As it relates to the early experience, a comment in terms of 2 waves of buyers that we see : the early initial buyer group and then the latter surge that the press talked about in terms of wave 1. What we know is that in the early buyer group, on average, that buyer group was older than our expectations. They bought a bit richer benefit plan than our expectations, so what was still the nucleus, but it's a bit richer benefit plan. And their medical utilization in the first month or so of experience was much higher than any of the -- our book of business norms, including some categories of severity around that. What we also know is that in that second wave or the latter surge of buyers, that population is younger than the initial population and more in line with our age expectations. Two, they bought leaner benefits on average than the first group and a bit more in line with our expectations. What we don't know is what the utilization is because they just signed up very recently. And as Tom pointed out, within our outlook, we took into consideration our early experiential set and projected that forward with some reasonability in terms of our overall outlook, and the most important thing here is that it's manageable in the aggregate context of our overall organization. Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay, okay. That's helpful. And then want to go to sort of hep C cost in the quarter. I think you have some details there what it was last year, what are your projections, I guess, around that for this year and then maybe how you're attempting to control it. David M. Cordani: Sure. Just a little context and then specific to my experience. First, I think it's important to recognize that specialty pharmaceutical costs have been and continued to be a major trend and cost driver. As far as our internal processes, we project specific medical trend for specialty pharmacy, taking into consideration what we know about existing drugs, utilization patterns and, importantly, what's in the emerging pipeline. And while Sovaldi was not specifically broken out as a trend item for Sovaldi, our experience in the first quarter suggested our trend assumption for specialty pharmacy is in line with our overall aggregate experience, including the Hep C experience. Lastly, very important to note from our point of view, to achieve the right AAA outcome of clinical quality, service quality and affordability, you have to be able to manage the medical experience, the pharmacy experience and the specialty pharmacy experience, so the overall whole person could be managed with the right physician engagement. Specific to our financial results, when you think about the guaranteed cost in the Medicare population to the nearest $10 million or so in the first quarter, it's about $10 million for us, the rate of growth was accelerating throughout the quarter, and we've taken that into consideration, our full year outlook that Tom made reference to and still is considered in our medical trend outlook, which has not changed at this point in time. Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. Just on the ASO side, though, you customers there, what can you do, I guess, to control it at that point from that side of the business as oppose to an issue for you all, specifically? David M. Cordani: Sure, and I appreciate the clarification. Important to note that in terms of our clinical programs, clinical engagement within our company, in general, we don't differentiate the way we actively engage physicians for an ASO customer versus an experienced rated person with a guaranteed cost customer. The clinical guidelines, clinical efficacy guide set. So the same level of active management with the physicians around that patient population, understanding medication compliance, alternative treatment categories and active management take place. And again, to date, while an acceleration of cost specific to that drug, our overall specialty pharmaceutical trend is, generally speaking, in line with our expectations. And our overall medical trend, as Tom made reference to, remains in line with our expectations. So the same active management takes place regardless whether or not it's an ASO client, a shared risk client or a guaranteed cost client. Operator : The next question comes from Justin Lake with JP Morgan Chase. Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : First, a follow-up on the Medicare Advantage book. Looking ahead to 2015 bids in June, can you tell us if you expect to try to bid back to mid-single-digit margin target that you've typically discussed for the current low-single-digit you're expecting for 2014? David M. Cordani: Justin, it's David. Macro level, not helpful to publicly discuss our bid strategy and margin objectives. To give you a little bit more color than that, first, stating the obvious, the improvement we're experiencing in the first quarter of medical cost performance, as well as the favorable maturation of the fourth quarter, is obviously directionally helpful in our journey. Secondly, as you referenced, our long-term margin objectives are not the margin performance that we are experiencing in 2014. That's clear. So as we set our expectations, you should expect it on a, obviously, market-by-market and on a very precise basis to seek to ensure that we are positioning a benefit program that is differentiated and attractive, while balancing a fair return, and we would like to see a step forward in terms of our performance as we go into '15 and then '16 and beyond. So, directionally, yes, but as for specifics, we're not going to comment in terms of what our margins objectives are for 2015 at this point. Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Great, that's helpful. And then just a couple more follow-ups on this Individual segment. First, it sounds like you guys are taking a cautious look at the 3Rs and specifically, Tom, you talked to the -- I want to ask you about the risk corridors. Given the government discussion of budget neutrality here, can you tell us whether you feel comfortable booking a receivable in places where you are into the risk corridor because you have negative margins? Thomas A. McCarthy: Yes, Justin, again, as you kind of did pick up, we are taking a cautious view on the 3Rs. Now that specific accounting question, we'll get to that someday. But right now we haven't incorporated any impact for risk adjusters or risk corridors and given the uncertainty and the dynamics, we're not really expecting any significant impacts for the year. So I don't think that's going to be a key issue. Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And so what kind of margins are you expecting in Individual? Thomas A. McCarthy: Justin, your question, for 2014 or long term? Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : No, '14, I'm sorry. So what are you now kind of embedding in guidance for individual book? David M. Cordani: Justin, we didn't obviously break out the margin specifically. To give you a little bit more color, as you recall from our -- let's go back to the strategic positioning here. We said we would take a very focused position, we've positioned ourselves in 5 states, in a limited number of markets in those states. We suggest very consistently that we did not expect that this will be a profit driver or a positive profit contributor before the year started. That's where we stand today, even acknowledging the bit of margin pressure that Tom made reference to. And we think it's appropriate at this point in time to take a cautious view of the component of the 3Rs, which may present some softening opportunity on a go-forward basis, but our current first quarter performance does not contemplate that. And important part is how do we position ourselves for 2015 as we go forward. As we sit here today, our bias is to extend into a few additional markets, we know which markets those are, we haven't made the final calls there, but we have a high level of engagement with physician and hospital partners who would like that expansion, and we're making that assessment. So clearly, taking into consideration our current experience, we still have a bias to extend, but we haven't declared that at this point in time. Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I'm sorry, just one clarification. You're expecting to lose money in the Individual market for 2014? David M. Cordani: It is correct, and that is consistent with our expectations before the year started. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I just wanted to understand the guidance a little more. It seems like the raise in the guidance on the commercial side is kind of less than the PPD that you saw in the quarter. And if you adding in the share repo in PPD, the guidance raise looks to be entirely related to value and there was additional outperformance in the quarter. And, guess, maybe Individual is just a little bit worse, but just trying to understand what the delta is more specifically. Thomas A. McCarthy: Sure, Kevin, it's Tom. So first, again, stepping back, there are a lot of positives in the first quarter, and we do expect they will continue to provide positive momentum for the year. We have continued solid execution of our strategy, we have the good growth in our targeted markets, we have strong medical cost management, leading to lower-than-expected medical cost in both commercial and seniors and disciplined expense management, resulting in favorable operating expense. So all good things. That said, it is early in the year. And while we're pleased with the positive result for medical cost in the quarter, we're really not ready to project that, that will continue favorable for the full year. Our outlook does, as we've talked about, include some caution regarding Individual results as the early stages of that market are unfolding. And as we've also referenced, we have some timing impact to offset in the first quarter operating expense favorability, including a ramp up of strategic spending over the course of the year. So on balance, that lets us do the outlook we've offered. And overall, we're really pleased with the start for the year and confident in that full-year outlook. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : And I guess, maybe, in response to one of the questions earlier, David mentioned that the favorable development in the MA book kind of give you a better starting off point than maybe you thought kind of entering the year. Can you just go back to what you now know about Q4? Talk about what really -- what is the issue and how much of a variance it was versus your expectations as you enter 2014? David M. Cordani: Sure, it's David. So a little bit more color there. What we did see is, as we play back the tape, in the latter part of Q3, we saw some elevation in cost. We saw that play through in the early portion of Q4, and we represented that as we went through the year-end activity. The good news is that as the latter part of Q4's claim experience matured, that matured more favorably than that spike that transpired in the latter part of Q3 and the early part of Q4. Secondly, that abatement continued into the first quarter of 2014. And finally, some of the very targeted actions that we begin to execute, whether they were re-contracting, network optimization, also started to make contributions in the first quarter. All net-net positives. And as Tom said, at this point, we're not ready to declare kind of a full projection on a go-forward basis. We're really pleased with the jump off, we're really pleased with the favorable development in the fourth quarter and we're very pleased with the net performance in the first quarter. Operator : The next question comes from A.J. Rice and with UBS. Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : First of all, if I just might ask for an update on with respect to the PBM, the integration with Catamaran, are you -- how's that -- any update on that and where you're at relative to the -- getting ready for the selling season this year and what are your expectations for the PBM selling season? David M. Cordani: A.J., it's David. Just a moment of backdrop and then specific to your question. Our PBM is well-positioned, strong performing assets. We've been able to demonstrate that our approach to the market around integration, medical and pharmacy, delivers a very positive, both clinical outcomes, service outcome and affordability. The actions we embarked upon to further strengthen our cost of goods sold, secure an innovative technology platform and accelerate our innovation cycle, because of that, are going to be net adds to that. The headline is we're tracking very positively to our expectations. Secondly, good marketplace receptivity from clients in the overall marketplace, relative to both our current value proposition, as well as our enhanced value proposition as we see in the marketplace. You'll note that we had some slight growth in our pharmacy business in terms of net covered lives, again, which we're pleased with. But we're optimistic that, that momentum, obviously, continues on an go-forward basis, and we're on track with our expectations. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And I might just come back to the Sovaldi question in a different way. I guess, with your ASO membership, obviously, they're holding that cost themselves, you're working whether to try to mitigate that. At a time when people out there telling them, \" Hey, join the private exchange, give up that, go back to fully insured.\" Is -- give us some flavor for whether this is creating confusion among that self-insured base at this point. Are people -- or is it creating any kind of disruption that might further that push to private exchanges from your perspective? David M. Cordani: A.J., it's David. So taking the intent of your relative to using Sovaldi as a cost driver and a cost driver putting affordability pressure. At the end of the day, I think you hit a really important macro theme here, which is there's a fundamental affordability challenge societally, whether the client or an employer is financing it, an individual is financing it and as we see whether or not governmental entities are financing it. So what we see, to your point, is clients are more open and active than ever to explore solutions that can demonstrate really significant value in terms of improving clinical quality and more sustainability of cost. To date, as we've demonstrated, we've been quite successful in terms of being consultative, working to put the right benefit design, incentive and engagement capabilities in place, wellness programs, specialty programs, network designed with our collaboratives and then offer a variety of funding alternatives. So you should envision, A.J., that in many cases, our consultative selling-- sales force offers more than one way to finance a benefit program and consults with our clients to be able to make a choice. We think more of that consultation will take place in the future versus less, and employers will continue to choose what works best for them. What I don't think is, I don't think Sovaldi or Hep C, as an example, is a binary trigger to make a client do something very different with their benefit programs. It raises awareness that doing the same thing over and over, if you're not getting a positive result, is probably not going to yield a positive result next year. And we're pleased with the fact that our clinical quality is strong, we've yet to deliver another year of outstanding medical cost performance relative to any industry benchmark, and that comes from being consultative, engaging the client, working differently with their individual customers and working differently with the physicians, and we think more of that will come in the future. Operator : The next question comes from Carl McDonald Citigroup. Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : First question is on the guaranteed cost business. If I look at the enrollment and back out the individual growth, it looks like the, we'll call them, group guaranteed cost, was down about 10% sequentially in the first quarter. So can you just walk through what you're seeing there, if that's aggressive pricing, if that's ASO conversions, and any other factor? David M. Cordani: It's David. Just at a more macro level, as I referenced previously, when you look at the year-over-year, first and foremost, of the guaranteed cost block, historically, it's been a smaller portion of our overall portfolio of businesses, 8% to 10% of our covered lives. Two, as we step into 2014, we're rolling off the Limited Benefit business, which was a guaranteed cost portion of the pool. We have a, I'll call it, a well-performing employer book, as Tom made reference to, book of business, and then we have a growing individual block of business. So that's the guaranteed cost, if you will, from a slide standpoint. Overall marketplace, we continue to see a high level of receptivity for some of the more transparent funding alternatives within the employer space. ASO, ASO with Stop Loss, assured returns. And then finally, importantly, in a segment that is historically valued, both guaranteed costs and otherwise, what we call the Select Segment, employers between 51 and 250 employees, we regularly offer guaranteed cost side-by-side with ASO Stop Loss, and we continue to be successful there with both programs. However, a bit greater than 50% of the new business sales there and ramping up beyond that are ASO Stop Loss. So market trend, more transparency. Two, changing our book of business with the run-off of the limited benefit business, replaced with growth of the individual block of business, and a, I'll call it, a somewhat stable, in terms of aggregate lives, well-performing group insurance block of business that we have in our portfolio today. Thomas A. McCarthy: And the dynamics that have been impacting our guaranteed cost business, are as David has suggested, the dynamics of which programs customers are choosing. Keep in mind, we don't have really any play in the small group market segment, which seems to be where the commentary around intense price competition has been coming up. And the segments we're playing in, the pricing environment continues to be pretty rational. Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : All right. So my down 10% figure adjusted for the Limited Benefits. Taking from your comments that you're saying most of it is conversions to ASO, then? Thomas A. McCarthy: That's in the ballpark. Conversions is a tricky word, right? I can't -- this is a segment that has -- the lower end of this segment has a lot of turnover, so I'm not sure whether it's all conversions from risk to customer to ASO in that segment. It's more, as the new customers are coming in, they tend to be buying ASO programs more than they have in the past. Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And then the other question was just, if I take -- again, focusing on health care, if I take out the guaranteed cost in the Medicare component, it looks like the loss ratio on all of the other products experienced, rated, Stop Loss, et cetera, was about 500 basis points better, sequentially. The fourth quarter loss ratio was inflated versus what you've been historically. But just the question is, is the first quarter loss ratio in the other segments a sustainable number for the rest of the year? David M. Cordani: Yes, again, Carl, as we talked about last quarter, there's a lot of things in that residual component of loss ratio calculation. But I would highlight, as we said last quarter, the results last quarter were somewhat of an anomaly, and that all the businesses reported on in that group of products have been performing pretty well for us. So I'd say, the performance we've seen in the quarter, we'd expect to be consistent. Whether that ratio moves around, as mix of business changes, it's a little hard to know how that would play out over the course of the year, but we were happy with and continue to see good performance in those other product lines. Operator : The next question comes from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : So your India [indiscernible] officially began to find products in the country recently. Maybe, how is that relationship is developing? Maybe how should we think about the long-term earnings contribution from the interim, national markets like India, Turkey, et cetera. Do you continue evaluating new market entries, or are you still focused on increasing footprint penetration in your existing market? David M. Cordani: Andy, it's David. So relative to the global marketplace, thinking about 2 major marketplaces we compete in, and then I'll address India, Turkey and the like. One is, we call it, the Global Employer marketplace. Historically, for expats, for corporations, IGOs, NGOs, that business, we currently serve truly globally around the world, and we have customers, individuals we service across the globe, that business continues to grow very attractively. We have the largest delivery network in the world in terms of supporting those individuals on behalf of our clients, and we'll continue to grow that. Secondly, within that business, increasingly, we're hearing from some clients within key geographies where they have critical mass, a desire for some, I'll call it, health improvement and productivity improvement programs. So think about the employer businesses global across all geographies. The business that you're referencing is our direct individual supplemental benefit business. Two markets that we sought to enter strategically were the ones you referenced, Turkey and India. Turkey, we are successfully selling and has been successfully selling now for some time. And we're pleased with the direction of trajectory there. India, very exciting. We completed all the regulatory reviews and approvals, and in the first quarter, we actually began selling products and services there. We view India as a long-term attractive, very attractive growth opportunity, both for the individual business, as well as for clinical services. For example, India has the highest percentage of diabetics in the world and it is a major burden for the social mandate and were viewed as being part of the solution within that. Finally, as it relates to additional geographies, there are some additional geographies that are attractive to us, but most importantly, within our portfolio today, our existing markets, plus India and Turkey, present a very nice growth profile, and we will systematically identify new markets that are attractive to enter as we go forward over the next few years. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Great. And then just a follow-up on something else here I have to clarify. What are you now expecting for exchange enrollment, including the March and April surge we saw, and how does that compare to your expectations? Are you now expecting exchange enrollment to be kind of above your initial expectation? Thomas A. McCarthy: So Andy, it's Tom. I'll give you some context on the overall Individual block. So by the end of the year, by the end of 2014, we'd expect to have about 290,000 customers in the Individual segment. About 40% of those customers will be on ACA policy and about 60% will be of the legacy non-ACA policy. So a combination of early renewals or keep your plan states. And of the ACA policies, we'd expect about 60% to be on the exchange and 40% to be off the exchange. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : And how does that compare to your kind of original expectations heading into the year? Thomas A. McCarthy: A little bit. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Looking at the reinsurance and recoverables, it was up from $150 million both sequentially and year-over-year to $250 million. So that really sort of helped out your performance a little bit. Can you talk about why that improved, why you have so much more in reinsurance recoverables. I know you said you didn't book anything for risk adjusters or risk corridors, so I'm kind of curious what drove that. Thomas A. McCarthy: That reinsurance recoverable -- this is Tom, that reinsurance recoverable number is a function of some of the business we seeded off. And you might recall the run off reinsurance business has some market value sensitivity to the reported financial statements. So that really is largely just readjusting the seeded amounts based on market performance. There's really nothing going on there. And the impact of the 3Rs on that is nonexistent at this point. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And that was tied to the medical claims payables. So you're still leaving the runoff reinsurance have impacted that? Just from the claims payables line stated $1.9 billion. Thomas A. McCarthy: I thought you were asking specifically about reinsurance. So medical claims payable, again, that's just regular operating activity. There's really medical reserves are up at the end of the quarter, no surprises in that result. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Actually, there were $1.9 billion, both sequentially and... Thomas A. McCarthy: You take that to another digit, it would actually be up, it's actually up almost $100 million, I guess, if you take it the one to the next digit. So again, so that means it was like 1850 going to 1950 or in that ballpark. So again, if you look at the days claims payable, they're up. If you look at the -- if you had the specifics of the dollar balance are up, there's no issues in the -- we still feel very comfortable with our reserve position in all of our businesses. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about your 2015 selling season, and what you think will be different from 2015 relative to 2014 in terms of the number of clients available or the number of the business moving and what clients are looking for at this point? David M. Cordani: Peter, it's David. Early in the cycle, so I'll give you some directional comments. As it relates to the 2015 selling season, by way of purchasing dynamic, we continue to see those clients that we both serve today, as well as prospects, very aggressively addressing incentive and engagement-base program designs. That could be a coinsurance program with an incentive pool attached to it. It could be a consumer-directed program, but a whole variety of way to use incentive and engagement-based tools. Secondly, much more active utilization within consideration around health coaching and advocacy, health advocacy services, including an increasing appetite for on-site health coaches, something we do very well. And then third major theme is in terms of increase in specialty carve-in demand. So some of the themes that we put specialty carve-outs, we see some direction in terms of more integration. As it relates to volume from a pipeline, early indicators relative to the, we typically call the national account pipeline, let me just define that, because we define it differently. So it will be commercial employers with 5,000 or more employees, that's the way we define it, it's a little bit different than the market, that are multistate. Early indications for that pipeline is inbound opportunities, outbound opportunities, no major macro change in pattern there, decision-making cycle, a little longer because of the complexity of some of the benefit attributes I just talked about today, and we would expect to have a net market competitive positive performance as our strategic direction go into 2015. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : And what about on the smaller group and select size? Do you see them looking more at public options and things like that or exchange options? David M. Cordani: Yes, It's quite early to talk about 2015 for the smaller group. Remember, we don't play under 50. In the Select segment, which is 51 to 250, we're in the heart of the 2014 selling season everyday, and will be through the second quarter and the third quarter. As it relates to the makeup of our book of business, we have a high percentage, even in that book of business of clients who value what I referenced before. They're actively engaged, using incentives, we have examples of 75 and 100, 125 [ph] employers that are using on-site biometrics, health engagement, et cetera. So we don't see dramatically a lot of demand for public exchange within our target subsegment there. But important to note, we're in the heart of the 2014 selling season within that portfolio as we sit here today. Operator : The next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink. Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Yes, just to follow-up on some of the question on your commercial book of business. It looks like the big growth right now is happening in Select, where you've grown almost 15% on membership, Stop Loss is growing 20%, I'm assuming there's a lot of correlation between that. And finally, in Individual, where you're talking about, this year at least, having some headwinds to profitability. The rest of it looks flattish, which is actually better than maybe some of the competitors there are reporting in some cases. So if you look at that book and the growth rates, how do you think about de-risking in and do you expect to keep that level of growth within those markets, specifically retention and growth in select? And then how would you grow your Individual book by making it more profitable? David M. Cordani: Ana, it's David. I think overall, you painted a picture of the various segments. So starting where you started. Our Select segment, which is, again, employers with 51 to 250 employees has been and continues to be a very attractive growth segment for us. Within that segment, we sell guarantee cost and we sell ASO with Stop Loss. Typically, in a highly bundled fashion with our specialty products and services. And we're somewhat agnostic, meaning in terms of providing the choices for clients and giving them the financing options that works best for them. Our growth in that segment, we're very excited about and pleased with, comes in an environment where our team is consultative and working to design benefits that are positioned for those specific employers. And historically, this segment has not have a lot of choice. This segment has had prepackaged guaranteed cost alternatives only and is tired of confronting an environment of a sustainable medical cost trends. So we see this as a continued growth segment for us and it's one we're quite excited about and we're comfortable with the risk profile here. As it relates to the next segment that you inferred about but didn't speak specifically about, the regional segment, which we define as a large segment of our book, so 251 to 5,000 employees, I mean, large single-state employees. That business has grown and grown competitively and attractively year-on-year, and we expect that throughout the residual portion of the year, we'll demonstrate some growth there. Finally, to your point, in the Individual segment, we have a little higher growth, a little higher growth than we expected. It is not profitable. We did not expect for it to be profitable in the first year, very important. We did not plan for it to be profitable and we view that, that was manageable within our portfolio, and we expect to, on a very pinpointed basis, channel the market learnings and the evolution of the market as we position that portfolio for 2015. So net-net, for the enterprise as a whole, we actually like our positioning coming out of the first quarter this year with good growth, good revenue performance, good specialty penetration, strong medical cost performance that positions us for this year, and then stepping into 2015. Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : So what you're saying is that your competitive strength continues and the likelihood of any shift to public exchanges, particularly into the lower end of the market is at this point? David M. Cordani: Yes. And Ana, I would just pinpoint 2 comments. Again, knowing that we don't play in the under 50 market; and two, the target clients on a very specific basis. So I'm not speaking for the entire client universe between 50 and 250. I'm speaking towards, in our core markets and for the clients we are targeting, we continue to see high receptivity for the active engagement programs as evidenced by our growth, as evidenced the our strong net retention, as evidenced by our market-leading medical cost trend, and within that, as long as we continue to deliver value, we see good opportunities in the future. Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Now on the International, which is the other growth segment, and I think you talked about Turkey and India. But just on the core growth, it looks like the U.S., both Korea and the China JV you are growing, overall you had good revenue growth, you saw some margin compression, I think you made some commentary about claims cost in Korea ticking up and some retention initiatives and so on. And you alluded to some pressure in the fourth quarter of '13. Is this a structural margin compression story, or is there any pricing or other action you can take to get the margins back up? And would the normalized growth rate of 7% to 14% that you've guided to potentially go at the upper end or even higher, 2015 and beyond. Thomas A. McCarthy: And it's Tom. So first, again, stepping back, we continue to get good results in our Global Supplemental Benefits business. We have great revenue growth in the quarter, very consistent with our expectations. And the earnings in the quarter were actually also consistent with our expectations. We have a little bit of a tough quarter-over-quarter comparison, given the strong results we reported in 2013. But this business is performing as we'd expected. We're continuing to make investments to expand the business. We already talked about India, we've got some investments in new distribution sources. You pointed out Korea. Our Korean operations continued to perform pretty well. We did have that higher seasonal claim pattern that we report at the end of 2013 that did continue into early 2014, but now it's back to normal levels at the end of March. So I think, overall, we're pretty happy with the positioning for this segment and comfortable that it's going to be a good segment for us with fast growth. Operator : The final question comes from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Just, David, you had talked about sort of 2 waves of sign-ups with regard to the ACA's compliant plans. Can you give us sort of a sense of the pace of the sign-ups when you sort of finished up with the wave 1 and then moved into the wave 2, just might help with some context around the change in the MR outlook. David M. Cordani: Sure, Chris. As I think about the wave 1 of business that came on, known and is being serviced in the first part of the quarter. So came through, obviously, the entire fourth quarter of last year, but the wave that we were servicing in the month of January. Then think about a pretty meaningful low in terms of the wave, obviously, lives are coming on with a significant surge coming in the March and latter part of March timeframe, whereby, we know the profile of those individuals, as I referenced, younger, than the original group. We know the benefits they purchase by medical category, leaner. We know some kind of risk characteristics to that group better than the first group. What we don't know is the utilization pattern in the first quarter results we're talking about here. But we would point toward a better risk profile than the first group. So think about bucket 1 on-board, being serviced, throughout the fourth quarter, small, additional growth throughout the quarter, and then a big surge toward the latter part of the quarter enrolling literally at the end of the quarter or going into the April timeframe Operator : I will now turn the call over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David M. Cordani: Thanks. To conclude, I'd like to emphasize a few key points from our discussion this morning. Cigna's first quarter results were strong and with meaningful contributions from each of our business segments. Our results are driven by the continued effective execution of our focused strategy, which reflects the commitment and dedication of our more than 35,000 colleagues working around the world. By aligning our capabilities with the goals of our customers and clients, we are improving the health, well-being and sense of security of the people we serve around the globe. We're confident in achieving our increased outlook for the full year of 2014, and we remain committed to achieving our long-term average EPS growth of 10% to 13%. Thank you for joining us this morning and for your continued interest in Cigna, and we look forward to continuing our discussions in the future.

Please go ahead, Mr. Detrick. Edwin J. Detrick: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Ted Detrick, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's second quarter 2014 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for full year 2014. Now, as noted in our earnings release, Cigna uses certain financial measures, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP, when describing our financial results. Specifically, we use the term labeled, adjusted income from operations, and earnings per share on the same basis as the principal measures of performance for Cigna and our business segments. And a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. Now on our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2014 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of the risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and is in our most recently report filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Please note that when we discuss the number of covered lives for our global medical customers, we will be doing so on a basis that excludes those individuals that were previously covered under Limited Benefits plans. As a reminder, we exited the Limited Benefits business as of December 31, 2013, as required by the Affordable Care Act regulations. I would also note that when we discuss our earnings outlook for 2014, it will on the basis of adjusted income from operations. And lastly, our outlook for earnings per share for 2014 excludes the effect of any future capital deployment. And with that, I will turn the call over to David. David M. Cordani: Thanks, Ted. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. To begin, I'll briefly review highlights from our second quarter financial results. Next, I'll provide an update on how the effective execution of our strategy is addressing global challenges, such as lowering health risks, and improving productivity, affordably, and clinical quality. In addition, our profile, our supplemental benefits business continues to meet the needs of global consumers and is driving attractive growth across our international markets. Next, Tom will offer insights on our performance, as well as an updated outlook for the remainder of the year before we open the floor to your questions. After that, I'll leave you with a few closing remarks. Let's get started with some highlights. Our track record of strong performance and competitively attractive financial results continued in the second quarter, with each of our business segments contributing meaningfully to Cigna's results. Our second quarter 2014 consolidated revenue increased 9% to $8.7 billion. We reported adjusted income from operations for the second quarter of $530 million or $1.96 per share, which represents a per share increase of 10% over the second quarter of 2013. Turning to each of our segments. We again reported strong results across our Global Health Care business. Our continued focus on delivering engagement-based solutions that leverage innovative physician partnerships is resulting in high-quality clinical outcomes and competitively differentiated medical costs for our customers and clients. These outcomes are driving strong customer retention, supporting our work to deliver localized and personalized care for customers around the world. Our Global Supplemental Benefits business had another strong quarter, as Cigna continues to effectively deliver differentiated products and services for our growing number of customers worldwide. In a moment, I'll discuss this strategically important business in more detail. The results of our Group Disability and Life segment continue to be strong, driven by our disability and productivity model, which produces industry-leading return-to-work results. In our group business, we are putting our customers front and center, leveraging our broad, talented clinical teams and supporting their work with actionable insights to help our customers improve their well-being and sense of security. In total, our second quarter results reflect strong performance that remains firmly grounded in Cigna's clear and focused strategy of going deep, going global and going individual. Now I'll highlight how we position Cigna to compete and win in a complex global marketplace, both today and in the future. We faced some serious challenges that continue to confront health systems around the world, our response has been, and continues to be, to emphasize innovation, with the focus on affordability and personalization, which from our point of view, requires a highly localized focus. At Cigna, personalization describes how we are addressing today's increasing retail-oriented marketplace and the growing demand for products and services that are personally relevant to each individual's needs, needs that clearly evolve and change at each life and health stage. And localization, sharply targets Cigna's decision-making process in local market structures, with locally-based leadership teams and expert resources, who best understand their home markets, and we drive delivery of our innovative solutions and value proposition each and every day. The syntheses on localization and personalization, along with our focus on achieving improved clinical quality outcomes has driven us to engage collaboratively with physicians and individuals, uniquely defined by their local market characteristics to emphasize deep and broad clinical excellence within our Cigna teams for the benefit of our customers and to innovate new customer-driven and incentive products and services that engage our customers in a highly personalized manner. This includes Cigna's Collaborative Accountable Care arrangements, which we launched back in 2008. We recently surpassed our 2014 goal of establishing 100 collaborative arrangements, and as of today, have more than 1.4 million customers obtaining care through these models. These collaborative arrangements engage with individuals to encourage preventive care, reward healthy behaviors and to actively guide, coordinate and support the care journey of our chronic and acute customers. By closing gaps in care through programs that improve prescription adherence, quality health screenings and ensure follow-up care, we are seeing improved health outcomes and as a result, better affordably. We are going to improve to demonstrate the effectiveness of our collaborative arrangements with physicians. For example, for those arrangements that have been in operation for at least 2 years, nearly 3 quarters have met targets for improving quality, with a comparable percentage meeting targets for improving medical costs. These proof points clearly demonstrated that our collaborative arrangements with physicians are effectively delivering the right care at the right time at more affordable and sustainable levels. Now I'd like to turn to a part of our business that is predominantly based outside the United States and is of increasing scale and significance for Cigna. Globally, evolving markets are confronting a host of new societal and economic demands, presenting us with opportunities to deliver innovative solutions to protect health, well-being and sense of security. To meet these emerging needs, we have built a scale, differentiated platform for a fast-growing Global Supplemental Benefits business. This business is of increasing strategic importance for 3 primary reasons : One, it represents an attractive global market for Cigna with expanding opportunities among the growing middle class and seniors population. And additional opportunities in health care, as both governments and individuals around the world seek to expand private solutions; two, our broad, innovative distribution channels gives us more opportunities to effectively target and interact with individuals on a personalized basis; and three, our sophisticated individual expertise can be leveraged as the individual market evolves in the United States. Today's Cigna's Global Supplemental Benefits business has more than 12 million policies in force, primarily serving the growing middle class. These policies cover a wide range of health, life and accident products that provide individual customers with a diverse range of solutions targeted at filling the gaps in their social benefit programs and providing them with greater peace of mind. The unique differentiator and driver for Cigna in the marketplace are the more than 150 diverse infinity partnerships, we maintain throughout the world. Our broad experience and industry-leading capabilities in this distribution channel continue to drive new customer growth and help us deepen existing customer relationships. In addition, we are leveraging the range of innovative distribution channels to reach current and prospective customers in a personalized approach. For example, in the direct-to-consumer space, we continue to feel our industry-leading proprietary telemarketing programs with new personalized distribution channels, such as direct digital campaigns, branch banking, retail store outlets and home shopping television. Our ongoing innovation of distribution channels is continuing our success in helping to drive growth. In fact, today, these newer channels now represent more than 1/3 of new sales for this business. Another market segment with attractive potential for our global supplemental business is the Seniors segment. We recently expanded our efforts to support the needs of seniors through an innovative digital marketing strategy focused on establishing Korea's first health care membership program, which offers a broad array of unique, personalized services for this segment. This innovative and rapidly growing platform is called, Heyday, and within this very early stages, but it already has nearly 75,000 senior members. Supporting the needs of this fast-growing Senior segment in strategic markets around the world represents an attractive growth opportunity for Cigna. Our deep international experience in the individual market is also proving to be an advantage as we harness our analytical expertise to enhance and create solutions for the growing employer, individual and supplemental markets in the U.S. Our strong track record of meeting customer's needs in our global supplemental benefit business has resulted in leading financial performance over a sustained period of time. Specifically, over the last 5 years, our Global Supplemental Benefits business has delivered average annual growth in revenue of 19% and earnings growth of 20%. In addition, these businesses generate high returns in capital and very attractive markets. Cigna's substantial international footprint, differentiated capabilities and local teams of talented professionals enable us to effectively compete in some of the world's most attractive, existing and emerging growth markets. Given our strong market position and our ongoing strategic investments in Global Supplemental Benefits over the long term, we continue to expect 15% average annual growth in both revenue and earnings from this important segment. Turning now to our portfolio of Diversified Businesses. As we look to the future and acknowledge the complex challenges and market conditions that lay ahead, we are energized by what we view as a tremendous opportunity to grow our capabilities and further enhance the experience and value proposition for the customers we serve. At Cigna, we remain well positioned for sustained long-term growth, with an industry-leading global reach and broad capabilities that are firmly grounded in our clear and focused strategy. Over the course of 2014, we remain confident that each of our businesses will deliver continued growth. In addition, the strong returns on capital from our business give us flexibility to drive additional shareholder value through capital deployment opportunities. As we look beyond 2014, given our strong financial position, our capabilities to create value for our customers and clients and multiple growth businesses, we remain committed to our long-term average EPS growth target of 10% to 13%. Now to summarize my remarks before turning it over to Tom. Cigna's strong financial performance during the second quarter marks another quarter of competitively attractive revenue and earnings growth. The increasingly complex nature of change in the current business landscape presents significant opportunities to further innovate and grow. In our targeted markets around the world, we are harnessing the power of data and insights, and building an increasingly agile network of partners with the goal of driving differentiated value for customers and clients, as well as our shareholders. These capabilities across our diversified portfolio of businesses around the world remained grounded in the strong execution of Cigna's clear and focused strategy, and our strong balance sheet continues to give us a flexible platform for additional shareholder value creation. And now I'll turn the call over to Tom for a more detailed look at our results and our outlook. Tom? Thomas A. McCarthy: Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's Second Quarter 2014 results and discuss our outlook for the full year. Overall, this quarter's results are strong, driven by continued effective execution of our strategy with meaningful contributions from each of our business segments. Key highlights in the quarter include : Consolidated revenues grew 9% to $8.7 billion, driven by continued growth in our targeted markets; consolidated earnings grew to $530 million; and quarterly earnings per share increased 10% to $1.96 per share; and free cash flow remained strong, as we continued to deploy capital for the benefit of shareholders with $1.15 billion of share repurchases on a year-to-date basis. The strength of these results provides us with good momentum and confidence in our full year financial outlook for 2014. Regarding the segments, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Global Health Care results were strong, driven by our Commercial Employer group business. First quarter premiums and fees for Global Health Care grew 8% to $6.1 billion. This result reflects continued good growth in our ASO programs, that demand for these products remained strong. We ended the second quarter of 2014 with 14.2 million global medical customers, growing by approximately 170,000 customers on a year-to-date basis. First quarter earnings were $402 million and were primarily driven by business growth and specialty contributions. Turning now to medical costs. We continued to deliver medical costs that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization of care. Our commercial medical trend continues to be among the lowest in the industry, and given that over 85% of our U.S. Commercial customers are in transparent ASO funding arrangements, our clients directly benefit from these favorable medical costs. Medical cost also continue to reflect the recent low utilization trends. Regarding medical care ratios, in our U.S. Commercial Guaranteed Cost business, our second quarter 2014 Medical Care Ratio, or MCR, was 83.1% on a reported basis, or 84.3% excluding prior year reserve development. Our Commercial Employer risk businesses continued to deliver strong results, reflecting strong pricing, disciplined underwriting and continued effective medical management and physician engagement. The guaranteed cost MCR in the quarter also continued to be impacted by higher-than-expected claims on our individual business. In our Seniors business, our second quarter MCR for Medicare Advantage was 84.8% on a reported basis, or 85.1% excluding prior year reserve development. Second quarter Medicare Advantage results continue to reflect progress on the network and medical management actions we discussed in previous quarters, along with revenue pressure from the low rate environment. Across our Commercial and Seniors risks books of business, our second quarter earnings included favorable prior year reserve development of $16 million after tax compared to $20 million after tax in the second quarter of 2013. Moving to operating expenses. For the second quarter of 2014, the total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 21.5%. This includes the impact of the industry fee, which added about 110 basis points to the expense ratio in the quarter and was offset by efficiency gains and expense discipline. To recap, we had another strong quarter in our Global Health Care business. Now I will discuss the results of our Global Supplemental Benefits business, which David profiled earlier. This business continues to deliver very attractive growth and profitability. Premiums and fees grew 18% quarter-over-quarter for Global Supplemental or 13% on a currency adjusted basis. Second quarter earnings grew 24%, or 15% on a currency adjusted basis to $61 million, reflecting business growth, effective operating expense management and stable benefit ratios. For Group Disability and Life, second quarter results were also strong with premium and fee increases of 5% over second quarter 2013. Second quarter earnings in our group business increased 6% to $110 million. The quarter's earnings included a $35 million after tax favorable impact from a reserve study on our Group Disability business, as well as strong operating results in Disability, underscoring the strong fundamentals in our disability and productivity programs. For our Corporate and Other operations, results totaled to an after-tax loss of $43 million for second quarter 2014. Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, our second quarter results reflect strong revenue or earnings contributions from each of our business segments, as well as continued significant free cash flow. Turning to our investment portfolio. In the second quarter, we recognized net realized investment gains of $43 million after tax, coupled with a strong net investment income result. We are pleased with the quality and diversification of our investment portfolio and our overall investment results. Now, I will discuss our outlook for 2014. We expect to continue to deliver differentiated value for our customers and clients and strong financial performance for our shareholders in 2014. We now expect consolidated revenues to grow in the range of 5% to 8% over 2013, an increase of 1% versus prior guidance. Based on the strength of our first half results, our outlook for full year 2014 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $1.94 billion to $2 billion, or $7.20 to $7.40 per share. This represents an increase of $0.10 per share at the midpoint over our previous expectations. Consistent with past practice, our outlook excludes any contribution from additional capital deployment and any additional prior year reserve development. I would also note that full year 2014 adjusted income from operations includes approximately $110 million after tax, or $0.40 per share of acquisition-related amortization expense. I will now discuss the components of our 2014 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $1.61 billion to $1.64 billion. Regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect 2014 customer growth of approximately 1% to 2%. Turning to medical costs. Our year-to-date medical cost trend for our total U.S. commercial book of business is favorable to our prior outlook of 5% to 6%, reflecting continued effective medical cost management and physician engagement and low utilization trend. As a result, we now expect full year medical cost trends to be in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%, which is 50 basis points lower than our prior guidance. This updated range continues to contemplate some uptick in utilization over the balance of the year. Regarding medical care ratios, for our U.S. Commercial Guaranteed Cost book of business, we continue to expect the 2014 MCR to be in the range of 81% to 82.5%. This reflects continued strong results in our employer group business and pressure in our individual business. ACA enrollees continued to be high utilizers of Healthcare services, and likely will push our 2014 guaranteed cost MCR to the high end of our range. We continue to expect the impact of pressure from the individual business will be manageable within our overall diversified portfolio. For our Seniors business, our Medicare Advantage MCR for 2014 continues to be in the range of 84% to 85%. Regarding operating expenses for 2014, we continue to expect our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%. This outlook reflects increased spending for open enrollment costs and strategic initiatives in the second half of 2014, which will impact both the Global Health Care operating expense ratio, as well as adjusted income from operations. Now moving to the other components of our outlook. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth and earnings now in the range of $205 million to $220 million. Regarding the group Disability and Life business, we now expect full year 2014 earnings in the range of $315 million to $330 million. Regarding our remaining operations, that is, Corporate and Other operations, we now expect a loss of $185 million for 2014. So all in, for full year 2014, we expect our outlook for consolidated adjusted income from operations to be in a range of approximately $1.94 billion to $2 billion, or $7.20 to $7.40 per share. I would also highlight that we expect earnings and EPS in the second half of the year to be comparable between third and fourth quarter. Now, moving to our 2014 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have excellent financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with a strong return on capital in each of our business segments. Our capital deployment strategy and priorities have not changed. These priorities are : providing the capital to support the growth of our ongoing operations; pursuing M&A activity with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow in our targeted areas of focus; and after considering these first 2 items, we'll return capital to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase. Regarding free cash flow, we ended the quarter with the parent company cash of approximately $325 million. During the period May 1 to July 30, we repurchased approximately 5.5 million shares of Cigna's common stock for $500 million, bringing our total year-to-date share repurchases to approximately, 13.5 million shares for $1.15 billion. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we now expect to have approximately $750 million available for deployment during the balance of the year. Overall, our financial position and capital outlook remain strong. The higher returns on capital from our businesses, coupled with our strong balance sheet, means that we will continue to generate significant free cash flow to deploy for the benefit of shareholders. Now to recap. Our second quarter 2014 results reflect the strength of our diversified portfolio of global businesses and a continued track record of effective execution of our strategy. The fundamentals in our businesses remain strong, as evidenced by strong growth in revenue and earnings, competitively attractive medical cost and quality outcomes that directly benefit our customers and clients and continued strong free cash flow. Based on the strength of these results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our full year 2014 earnings outlook. And with that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Could you give us a little more detail on what you're seeing in the individual business? How the -- your read on the exchange utilization has changed over the course of the quarter? And what you expect will happen in the back half. David M. Cordani: Matthew, it's David. Let me just give you a little color of our approach to the individual and specifically, the exchange business and I'll tell you what we're seeing. First, our view of that marketplace is that 2014, 2015 and 2016 really represent version 1.0 of the market. So there's a lot to play out. For long-term success, we think that 3 things need to be in place. Clearly, insurance offerings that cover needed sick care, as well as proven preventative care. But in addition to that, for sustainability, we think 2 things are important. One is supporting engagement, incentive-based programs to get a more sustainable cost profile and health profile. And secondly, to enable ample network flexibility to engage and really focus on the high performing networks and the value-based networks, like our Cigna Collaborative Accountable Care networks. Now, my comments on our experience come back to the 5 states we're focused on in the exchanges to-date in about the dozen markets there. We saw 2 tranches of membership. The first tranche, and then we'll call the end of Q1, beginning of Q2 tranche. As we've discussed before, that first tranche was older than expected, purchased a little richer benefit profile than expected, and its utilization of services was higher than our expectations and higher than any of our competitors, classes of services, including oncology, maternity, muscular, skeletal, et cetera. The second tranche through the latter part of Q1, beginning part of Q2, which saw another surge. A bit younger profile purchased a bit leaner benefit profile; about the same amount of silver, but more bronze, less gold. Early to tell in terms of how that's playing out. But early signs are a little bit more favorable or a little healthier population. As we look to the second half in the year, we are anticipating to continue to see pressure here and our MCR outlook contemplates that, they will need to see pressure, and what we think is we're in the early part of a shake out here in 2014. Our final note is, we've positioned this business to be manageable. We didn't expect to make money. We're not making money here and there is some more pressure. It's manageable within the broad, diverse portfolio that makes up our company right now. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Just one follow-up on the 3Rs. Where are you on accruals now, or your outlook? I think you've talked to expecting reinsurance of under $100 million for the full year, and you're not accruing anything on the other 2Rs. Is that still where you are? David M. Cordani: Matthew, so -- directionally, through the first half of the year, we've accrued a total of about $60 million, $65 million after tax. The majority of that is in reinsurance. And our outlook contemplates a similar pattern in the second half of the year based on the experience we're seeing right now. Operator : The next question is from Justin Lake with JPMorgan. Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I just want to drill down a little bit further on the exchanges. Given the guaranteed cost ratio in the quarter and all the uncertainty on what's going on with medical cost trends, given the hospital results, can you help us delineate the core GC MCR versus what's going on in the individual business? For instance, what's the individual MCR right now? And where is that relative to where it was last year? David M. Cordani: Okay. Justin, it's David. Let me just kind of frame the overall earnings profile, and I'm going to ask Tom to walk through the guaranteed cost MCR in a bit of clarity here because there's some movement, quarter-to-quarter. A couple of headlines coming in. First, as we stepped into 2014, we acknowledge that -- it was again, a very disruptive and uncertain year. And we set goals and objectives, as you know, to grow revenue earnings and EPS, while continuing to invest in the company. Our results year-to-date for the aggregate franchise are strong, and they demonstrate, really, that balance of our portfolio. And net-net, we're pleased with our results through the first half of the year. Overall, our loss ratios and our medical costs are in line with our expectations, as Tom noted, for our aggregate book of business, our medical costs are a little favorable to our expectations and let us to improve our outlook on medical cost trend. And specifically, the variance that we're seeing in our aggregate guaranteed cost loss ratio is driven explicitly by the individual block of business, which is a larger percentage of our guaranteed cost of block of business than, maybe, the market average. So I'm going to ask Tom to give you a little bit of color in terms of the drivers of that movement and give you a little bit more dimensioning of what's driving the individual portfolio. Tom? Thomas A. McCarthy: So Justin, I'd say there's 3 major headlines related to our GC MCR this quarter, and I'd like to make sure you take away and then I will get into some of the nitty-gritty. First, as David said, our employer group business MCR continues to perform well and remains very consistent with our expectations. Second, the primary driver of the increased GC MCR on this from our individual business. And then, finally, as you'd, expect in period-to-period comparisons, there are number of moving parts that are reflected in the quarterly results, and I'll get into that in a minute. So looking at the sequential increase, second quarter '14 versus first quarter '14, first, there was more a favorable prior year development recorded in the first quarter than the second -- that's kind of a normal pattern. Second, there is continued pressure from individual results. And individual share of our guaranteed cost business continues to increase as the individual business grows quarter-to-quarter. And then, finally, there's an impact from benefit structure across all of our risk business, reflecting the increased impact of deductibles, which results in a low first quarter MCR. So the combination of these 3 factors pushed the reported MCR and GC up by, probably, 7 points sequentially. The impact on the quarter, MCR is about evenly spread across all 3 of these factors. So reserve development individual pressure and benefit structure about evenly account for the 7-point sequential increase. Again, adding it all together, our employer business MCR remains consistent with our expectations and outlook, and our individual MCR is still high and likely to push our full year MCR to the high end of our range. Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. Maybe I can comment another way and then I'll jump off. It's just -- maybe just trying to think about what the sustainable earnings power of the business is. You're talking about losing money and exchanges that seems to be increasing. Can you give us some color around the magnitude of that loss and how we should think about? Maybe just, what you're doing on the individual business right now? And where do you think that can go next year, given your pricing action? And then the '16, what a normal margin would look like, so that we can get some idea what kind of headwind is this and where it would go from there? David M. Cordani: Yes, sure, Justin. And so stepping back. We believe that this marketplace has the potential for being a sustainable, attractive market. And what does that mean? A 3% to 5% margin business we would have to be able to see to get the returns that we would expect. So firmly grounded in that. Two, in the early shakeout period, we knowingly went into a market that we didn't expect that to transpire, given the profile of the states, the dynamics in the moving parts. Three, well, we expected to have earnings pressure in this book of business. The rate of earnings pressure is growing. And even some of your peers put out, at the end of the first quarter is that number in the $50 million, $60 million range? That was order of magnitude first quarter, assume that that pressure continues to mount a little bit beyond that, based on our outlook and even without in our outlook for 2014, we're able to not only achieve, but increase our overall earnings expectations, which we're proud of in the diversified portfolio. And then finally, as we look to 2015, we're going to remain in the 5 states we're in. Our expectations is that we're going to enter 3 additional targeted states with targeted focus with our collaboratives, apply some of our learning from this year, and make no doubt about it. Our expectation is improve off of the 2014 results, which is not sustainable. So long term, we would need a 3% to 5% margin expectation. Secondly, earnings pressure in 2014 exists and is increasing, but we're managing that within our overall portfolio. And lastly, we would expect to improve on this result in 2015. Operator : The next question is from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank. Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I just wanted to maybe flip over to discuss the Medicare MLR. And it looks like that was in line with your full year target, but at the higher end of that range and was up by a sequentially. So maybe if you can just walk us through the drivers of the higher MA, MLR sequentially. How much of that maybe relate to less reserve development as compared to the run rate business. And then maybe just talk about if there were any particular markets that did drive the higher sequential MLR and MA. David M. Cordani: Scott, it's David. I'll give a little bit in terms of how we look at the business through the first 6 months and ask Tom to give you the specific reconciliation of the MLR. As you know, we were very clear as we stepped into 2014, that we expected '14 and '15 to be a pretty disruptive marketplace, great pressure, industry fee, et cetera. It's also important to note that this is a market that is highly valued by seniors, with now fully, a 30% of all Medicare coverage are MA, high satisfaction rates, industry wide for MA, driven by higher engagement with physicians that are clinical outcomes, better services. Today, we're actually pleased with the targeted actions we implemented to improve the overall results, actions that included some product positioning, pricing actions, but very targeted network movements, as well as targeted medical management. And important to note that, as you indicated, our year-to-date loss ratio is in line with our expectations for both the first half of the year, as well as our full outlook. The only other qualitative comment I would give you is there are no unique hotspots by market that I would call out for you. There's a portfolio we're managing, but there's no unique hotspots. I will ask Tom to give you a little bit of a reconciliation of movement, Q-to-Q. But overall, expectations are in line with what we had for the first 6 months in the year. Thomas A. McCarthy: Scott, you've pretty much hit on the key factor in the sequential increase first quarter '14 to second quarter '14. Much of the increase relates to favorable prior reserve development that was reported in our first quarter results. If you adjust for the PYD, the MCR increased from about 84% in the first quarter to about 85% in the second quarter. So this is consistent with our expectations and our outlook for the full year. That 1% increase is within the range of expectations for normal quarterly variance here ad likely also reflects some deferral of services from the first quarter into the second quarter, which would be very consistent with the low utilization recorded in the first quarter. Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And then just had a follow-up question. Just would be interested if you can give us an update on how things are tracking around the national account selling season for 2015. And then, also, just interested in what you're seeing out in the market in terms of employer interest, in terms of large case ASO employers to shifting towards private exchanges just in the context that recently, Aetna talked about are they -- they're seeing a slowdown in that activity level or at least see the signing level of that particular theme for 2015? David M. Cordani: Okay Scott, it's David. A little color on both. Relative to 2015 -- and again, we'll speak to the national account piece because that's where we have some visibility. Important to remember, we define that buying segment a little more narrowly than the market does in total. So when I give you a comment, it's commercial employers with 5,000 or more employees that are multistate. So we defined a little bit more tightly. And also, important to note our strategic objective has been to hold market share in aggregate in a marketplace that's shrinking, while growing our penetration and engagement incentives and specialty-based programs. So as we look to the marketplace, for new business opportunities, year-over-year, we've had about the same looks in terms of the size of the pipeline and our kind of view of what's emerging there is that our win ratio will be similar year-over-year on new business. Second point, on the portion of our book of business that was out to bid year-over-year, our percent of our book of business that was out to bid was up somewhat year-over-year, driven by the cycle of the contracts we have. Within that, our retention rate of wins of those pieces of businesses that are out to bid are about the same. But because the percent that was out is a little higher, our net losses will be a little higher year-over-year. Putting the picture altogether for 2015, we're not giving you guidance. We'd expect to see continued progress in terms of some new business sales, continued penetration of our specialty and engagement-based capabilities, which are critical and we've got good traction, and a little softer retention rate than we had over the prior year, which was an outstanding retention rate. Last note I would say here, it's good to get through this year because, again, a meaningful percentage of our book of business was out to bid based on contractual cycle. And the team is going to come through that pretty favorably. As it relates to private exchanges, as we noted, early, I mean that innovation cycle, may present long-term attractive marketplace that we're clearly engaged in. That marketplace has to have transparent products and services that engage individuals variability around the incentive programs and a lot of flexibility for ongoing innovation, so programs can remain sustainable, affordable, et cetera. To date, we're positioned in the vast majority of exchanges. The activity we've seen was -- has been a lot of interest in exploration, including our own proprietary, but a modest amount of net movement. So netting it altogether from a Cigna standpoint, net-net, kind of a de minimis movement of wins and losses, but interest in the space. And the key here is demonstration of long-term value creation on which we think that dialogue will continue into '16 and '17. Operator : The next question is from Carl McDonald with Citigroup. Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : First question, I was just wanted to go back to the comment around the pattern of the 3Rs being similar in the second half of the year. I would think, given the way the reinsurance works, you should be seeing maybe exponential growth in the accruals in the second half, rather than a similar pattern. Thomas A. McCarthy: Carl, I know there's been some commentary on that lately. I mean, our expectation is that the 3R impact, when you net through all of them, all the Rs, the reinsurance, the risk adjustments in this quarter, it will probably be proportionate through the balance of the year. Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : How would that be, though? If the reinsurance kicks in at $45,000, presumably you'd have a lot more people hitting that in the second half of the year than you did in the first? Thomas A. McCarthy: Well, a few things going on, right. We will have more premium as we go through the -- Year 2, and we would also tend to develop claims to expected outcomes, and have some share of that reflected in our accruals to date. David M. Cordani: And Carl, it's David. Maybe to add on, when we say proportionate, to Tom's very important point in terms of more premium, as you know, the premium is raving and ramping up throughout the course of the year. So don't think about it as absolute dollar amount. Think about it in proportion to premium. So to your hypothesis, it will grow somewhat, but we're not signaling a tremendous spike in the last portion of the year, but rather a proportionate pattern to our current premium profile in the first half of the year. Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. And then second question is just where does the individual business stand from on an enrollment perspective today, and you broke that out between exchange and off exchange? And then what percent of the guaranteed cost revenue are you anticipating for the year? David M. Cordani: Carl, just at a macro level, the individual business, think about -- we've said before, 250,000 to 300,000 lives. We do expect to be approaching 300,000 lives, and maybe stepping back a little bit. Slightly less than 50% of that is ACA un-exchanged business that we're dealing with in terms of our portfolio. As it relates to percent of the guaranteed cost business, it's ranging between 25% and 30%, and as we trail toward the end of the year, we'd expect it to push up towards 30%. Operator : The next question is from Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse. Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Just want to go back to the individual book, and try to ask it a different way, I guess. How much did it actually pressure MLR in the quarter? So, in other words, if you just took the individual book out of your business, how would the MLR compare to the 83.1 that you reported? Thomas A. McCarthy: Well, Ralph, again, I don't think we're going to get into the specifics of that level of detail. But again, as far as the sequential increase, individual again accounted for about 1/3 of that 7-point sequential increase, and the GC MCR was performing exactly as we'd expect. Now there's a few things going on in the GC MCR. We've got some things coming out, like limited medical. We've got some things coming in, like pricing for the health insurance tax. And we've got, as we talked about, the benefit structure changes running through the quarters. But adjusting for all those things, GC MCR is exactly where we expected it to be, very consistent with our expectations. And again, as we look to the outlook, we're staying in the range that we talked about, but acknowledging that given the pressure in individual, we're going to be hanging out at the high end of that range. Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And then and can you talk about sort of reconciling that with sort of the -- taking down sort of your trend guidance for the year despite sort of the higher MLRs? Is that in the context of including sort of the ASO block that sort of drags that number down in terms of cost trend? I'm just trying to reconcile down sort of cost trend, but up MLR. David M. Cordani: Ralph, it's David. I think that's an important point. Stepping back, when you look at that cost trend, we talked about that aggregate commercial cost trend is across our commercial portfolio. So to remind you, greater than 90% of our commercial portfolio is ASO, about 85%, another 7% or so insured returns, and then the residual, somewhat less than 10% in guaranteed costs in total. So that's the block in totality. We've consistently delivered a very attractive competitive trend there, and we're quite pleased with the fact, that while we entered the year with an expectation at the low end of competitive range of 5% to 6%, as Tom noted in his prepared remarks, our year-to-date trend is below that range. So a number that starts with a 4. Hence, we improved that outlook to 4.5% to 5.5%. That's separable from looking at the guaranteed cost on loss ratio. So the underlying medical trend for the aggregate portfolio is performing very well. Why? Great penetration of aligned incentive and engagement-based programs, strong clinical management, and then continued emerging leverage of our physician partnerships in those collaborations. So that's transpiring. If you come back to Tom's point, in our employer guaranteed cost book of business, our MCRs are right where we expected them to be, great execution, medical cost trend netting to a favorable result and a very strong result. The simple delta in the guaranteed cost MLRs is driven by the individual block of business, which is a large percentage, as I noted, before 25% to 30% of the guaranteed cost portfolio. Operator : The next question is from Joshua Raskin with Barclays. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I hate to harp on the guaranteed cost MLR. But just doing some rough math, if I assume you guys had even $80 million or so of exchange premiums at 100% MLR, I think that's only explaining something in the ballpark of 100 bps year-over-year, and obviously, a little bit less sequentially. So I'm struggling to see, is it the remainder of the individual book that's performing much worse? And if so, I guess, why is that? Thomas A. McCarthy: So Josh, let's go back to the major headlines here. Again, we've got the -- you've got that already, I think, employer group, as we expect individuals, the source of the pressure, there's a number of moving parts. So the number of moving parts can be instructive in the quarter-over-quarter comparison, right? The quarter over -- in the quarter-over-quarter comparison, the most significant impact in the MCR increase is individual. That explains about 3/4 of the 400 basis point increase, and some of that relates to the fact that we had very low MCR individual business in the first quarter of last year. And now, we're to an average higher MCR individual business in the first quarter of this year. So that dynamic really is impacting the quarterly results, and obviously, we're also showing individual as a higher share of our premium in the second quarter of 2014, and I think you probably low-balled the ACA premium estimates in your math. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And so, I mean, David, is it a 125,000 lives now and trending slightly down? David M. Cordani: So Josh, think about our individual book of business being in the 275,000 to 300,000 range, with the ACA lives in excess of 100,000, and we're not flagging a big trend down for the year. We may move from 300,000 down to 280,000 in that range, but we're not flagging a big trend down for the year. When we look at the drivers here, though, important to note, we see the kind of pressure in the aggregate individual book of business because most of our individual lives are in states that allowed the movement of the -- keeping plans and movement to the ACA piece. So take this entire 300,000 lives, look through the revenue that goes along with that, ACA is in excess of 100,000, and again, 300,000 for the full year, potentially rating down to 280,000 by the end of the year. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And then just a follow-up on a couple of one-timers. The reserve study, the $35 million in disability and life, was that expected? Is that sort of normal course business, i.e., was that in guidance? And then what was the favorable currency impact? You guys haven't really called that out in the past. So was that sort of an above abnormal benefit that you saw in the quarter? Thomas A. McCarthy: Well, Josh, the first question on the currency. We call that -- now just to make sure people stay grounded on growth rates in Global Supp, in the overall scheme of things, it's about a $4 million impact. So it's not really that material to earnings. On the reserve study question, I mean, this is -- we've got a consistent track record of continuing to refine our return to work in productivity programs in our disability business, and over time, some of those outlooks show up in the run rate of the business, and some of those outcomes show up in the reserve studies. So while we don't actually specifically plan on a reserve study benefit, we do plan on operational improvements that will improve results in disability. So it's one of these things -- that specific study and the results from that specific study weren't planned for, but some level of improvement in group results was planned for and contemplated in the outlook. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Got you. So the guidance really had it. Whether it was explicitly in the reserve study or not, you guys did expect $35 million of disability earnings coming through that mechanism, I guess? Thomas A. McCarthy: We expected some improvement in the year. Quite frankly, we didn't necessarily expect it this quarter. It's kind of over the course of the year, but that's -- you have got the general idea. We were expecting improvements. Operator : The next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Can you go into the MA business a little bit more? Obviously, there's some questions about it in Q4. It seems like the last couple of quarters has come in a lot better. But can you talk about it in the context of how you're thinking about 2015? I know some of your competitors have given some color about how many counties they're going to add next year or new markets to enter next year, and just some general commentary around what the benefit designs are shaping up -- like, do you have any color around your visioning for next year? David M. Cordani: Sure, Kevin. It's David. As we noted previously, we're pleased with the traction, thus far, through the first 6 months, and some of the actions we've taken to -- in targeted geographies to sharpen the networks, further accelerate some of the clinical programs are paying dividends and results. As we look into 2015, our primary expansion strategy in 2015 will be to leverage additional counties off of some of our new market entries from 2014. So thinking order of magnitude, 40 to 50 additional counties that lever off of market entrees we went in, in 2014. Off of that, there'll be some county exits as all, but the net result will be total entry of additional counties. As it relates to benefit positioning, we'll step into 2015 with a notion of continuing to maintain an attractive benefit profile. As you know, the HealthSpring model has the ability because of its efficiency with the physician partnerships to build some additional benefit richness for the benefit of our respective customers. And we expect to maintain a good level of attractiveness, especially in how they are integrated and how they engage markets. And therefore, we would expect to grow as we step into 2015. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then just on the guaranteed cost business, it looks like membership is down. I mean, what's going on there? Are you seeing pricing pressures and you're walking away from business? How should we think about that? David M. Cordani: Relative to guaranteed cost, say, for, again, the portion that's in the individual block of business, it's a smaller portfolio for us -- a well- performing, but smaller portfolio. What we continue to see, most specifically here, Kevin, is continued very strong appetite for ASO stop-loss programs that are highly transparent, and work very collaboratively within employers to get the incentives aligned. We see higher levels of engagement and therefore, better returns. So as we've discussed in prior calls, we will frequently offer a guaranteed cost in an ASO stop-loss programs side-by-side, either for new business or renewal. And we continue to see the take-up on the ASO stop-loss. Order of magnitude, think about in our new business sales in the select segment, so 50 to 250 less employers, about 70% of all of our new business sales are ASO stop-loss versus 2 years ago is 50-50 guaranteed costs. So still a third in guaranteed cost, but that ASO stop-loss and transparent proposition continues to hunt very attractively. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, this is more kind of -- planned shift of your customers to a different product option rather than, necessarily, a cost or pricing issue? David M. Cordani: No. Broadly speaking, I would say the pricing environment continues to be competitive, but no major change. And when you say planned shift, I would just add to that, it's our consultative approach, where we're a bit agnostic at the end of the day as to which funding alternatives an employer takes, because in that space, either of them are highly penetrated with specialty portfolios, and what we want to do is provide choice. And thus far, the choice has led to more of the transparent funding mechanism. So it's planned full in terms of providing choice, but the marketplace is telling us they value that choice more so with the 70% of new business sales being ASO stop-loss. Operator : The next question is from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Just have a few clarifying questions. I'm hearing that the aggregate trend is separable from guaranteed cost. So am I hearing that even excluding individual, your trend commentary doesn't necessarily apply to the underlying guaranteed cost? Thomas A. McCarthy: Well, Christine, I'd say that we just want to be clear. There are 2 different reference points. One is the total commercial book for trend, and one is the GC book for the MCR. And in fact, in the overall trend result, we don't get the disproportion impact on -- from individual on our overall business, and the GC MCR is disproportionately impacted from individual. Now they run in the same range. So it's not like we're calling out major differences on the employer group business, and depending on what program type people select, but there certainly is a big difference in the relative impact of individual. It's disproportionately impacting the guaranteed cost MCR, and it really has a minimal impact, given it's such a small piece of our overall business and the overall book of business trend result. David M. Cordani: So Christine, to add onto that, if you take Tom's comments relative to the employer guaranteed cost portfolio, that continues to perform very positively and in line with our expectations, as is the overall medical cost trend. We're just trying to highlight that impact of the individual block of business is more disproportionate in guaranteed cost, but the medical cost trend is benefiting all of our employer block of business. Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : So the employer guaranteed cost trend is decelerating about 50 basis points as well? David M. Cordani: Our aggregate trend is decelerating 50 basis points, and you should think about that as across our entire employer block of business. Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay. So, as I think about Stop Loss in reinsurance, there's some -- you're selling a lot of that. The attachment points are a bit lower. I can conclude that you're benefiting in -- even within that business from trend deceleration. Is that true? David M. Cordani: You should think about the stop-loss book of business as a large book of business, a large book of business that covers both regional, as well as smaller employers with various attachment points and configurations, and a book of business that has grown, continues to perform well, and is repriced in a dynamic fashion. But the current economic environment benefits, very importantly, the employers through lower medical costs, and we benefit from some of that through the design of the stop-loss programs, and the stop-loss programs exist. Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then final question for me. You said you have some accruals in the individual book of business for expected outcomes in response to a question for the 3Rs. So I can assume that you're saying yourself, okay, I know a certain -- I know what my profile of this membership looks like, and I'm accruing all 3Rs somewhat evenly through the year, even though folks may not have hit that $45,000 attachment point yet for reinsurance. Is my understanding correct? Thomas A. McCarthy: As it relates to reinsurance, yes. Again, as it relates to the other Rs, we are being a little thoughtful about knowing that the information there is still a little scarce, so -- trying to be cautious in how we're accruing that. Operator : The next question is from Ana Gupte with Leerink Swann. Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Just wanted to follow up on the question from Josh and around your individual book. I think you have about at least 200,000 lives, as I understand, from your previous individual book. And I'm just wondering if you had a lower MLR on those before the ACA, and because of risk pooling, that has deteriorated as well, not just in the state you're expanding, but elsewhere? David M. Cordani: Ana, the answer is yes. Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Okay. So is that a big component of the 3 percentage MLR deterioration you're seeing, I guess, your [indiscernible]? Thomas A. McCarthy: It's a component, but I wouldn't call it a big component, Ana. I mean, again, the dynamic for the year is very high MCRs in the ACA-related business. And that business will grow over the year, both in the momentum of enrollment. And also, we do expect lapses in our legacy individual business throughout the year, and off period enrollment into ACA program. So the dynamic will be shifting towards more ACA business as we go through the year. Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : And then I think one of your competitors, as related to this, has been saying that they've been selected against because the not-for-profit Blues or even WellPoint are getting more previously insured people, whereas you didn't have a very large individual book. Do you think you are getting selected against? And if so, if they are ACA-compliant, would you not be eligible for risk adjustment beyond what you're projecting for this year? David M. Cordani: Yes, Ana, it's David. Nothing to speculate who's getting selected for and against. I think the important thing here is a couple-fold, and I'll come back to your risk adjustment in a second. We are in the very early phase of the establishment of a new market, and it is clearly dynamic and somewhat volatile, one. Two, we sought the position. Our play in that marketplace is focused, targeted and manageable within the overall portfolio, and our aggregate earnings reinforce that. Three, any selection dynamic is going to be state-specific; that is, playing through, and we'll kind of flush through as the 2015 renewal cycle transpires. And finally, as Tom referenced in a prior comment, on the, I'll call, the other 2 Rs other than reinsurance, while we've recognized some level there, we've sought to be on the conservative or prudent range. Hence, there may be some additional opportunity there. But again, we're trying to give a lot of visibility to this book, make sure our shareholders understand that it's manageable within our portfolio even though there's pressure in it. And finally, beyond what we think is the conservative end of some of the assumptions on the other 2 Rs, given the volatility of the market. Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : And are you comfortable about next year, considering this could become 50% of your guaranteed cost book that you're pricing strategy on your off exchange either through because you're encouraging forced attrition? Or on exchange, trying to improve your loss ratios that you wouldn't get a continually deteriorating book if you raised pricing on exchange is because of the potential second mover advantage? David M. Cordani: I'm not too concerned about a second mover advantage at this point. This is a new market, a very dynamic and moving marketplace. I think the most important point back to yours is ensuring laser-focus of specific resources, understanding the performance of the book of business, targeting benefit designs, pricing models, et cetera, and finally, where possible, leveraging our collaborative relationships so this population is becoming more actively managed more rapidly because what we're seeing in the utilization is an under-managed or underserved population. So I don't think the second mover advantage is an issue in the markets we're talking about, and we would expect a lot of movement in the markets in 2015. It's still a very immature marketplace. Operator : The next question is from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : So I know you mentioned increased spending in open enrollment cost, as related to OpEx spend, but OpEx spend in the first half was still well below your -- it's below your guidance. So can you just remind us about the types of investments during the second half and the expected timing there, as well as how we should think about some of that spending on a run rate basis? David M. Cordani: Sure, Andy. It's David. Just broadly speaking, first, our strategy has guided us to drive continued operating improvements in the business, and I'm proud of the fact that our organization has rallied around that. And you've seen continued improvement in our operating expense ratio, which has, in part, created further and further capacity for ongoing investment. 2014 marked another year when you adjust for the industry tax and improvements in our operating expense ratios. Our results are strong and in line with our expectations year-to-date, and our expectation in the second half of the year is that we'll see increased strategic spending. Give you some examples : staffing and capacitation to support new Medicaid expansion and contracts; two, readiness for our January new business; expanded marketing and branding programs; expanding distribution, as well as geographic investments in our international business; and then ongoing technological investments. Stepping back, I think we've demonstrated a good balance of making sure the rate, pace and timing of investments are prudent, and the returns is demonstrated with our sustained growth rate, are also there. So that gives you a little example of what we're contemplating in the second half of the year, and the team will continue to be disciplined relative to that. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then, changing direction a little bit. We've seen, obviously, continued declining unemployment rates. So I was just wondering if you're seeing any impact on your in-group growth versus, obviously, the attrition we've seen over the last several years, and if that's varied at all by your customer size and buckets. David M. Cordani: Andy, it's David. I would say slight. So as the unemployment rate has come down somewhat, as you know, unfortunately, for the country, in part, some of that is people leaving the workforce. Say, for that, in some of our industries, we've seen the rate of -- I'll call it dis-enrollment, or attrition, slow, sensitized, and in some cases, a little in-group growth. So small movement. I wouldn't signal a spike by any stretch of the imagination, but small movement from a continued dis-enrollment to a stabilization to, in many of the industries, a bit of an uptick of enrollment. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : And does that vary at all by market segment? Is there more growth in select, perhaps versus national accounts or... David M. Cordani: Absolutely. As we flag strategically, we see the national account segment as a net shrinking segment in the country right now based on a whole variety of reasons of employment profile. Commercially, as you go down market, the select, our 50 to 250 life employer market, we see some attractive growth there both organically in the employer profile, as well as our share of that. Operator : The next question is from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : With your membership growth target to be 1% to 2% this year, and you're talking about retention being down for next year, without putting words in your mouth, that sounds like you're talking about flat to down membership next year. With the lowest trend in the industry, and you lowering it again here today, why do you think you don't see more growth? Is there some -- is it just a breadth issue for you guys? Or is there some other issue that you need to address strategically to rectify why accounts are leaving? David M. Cordani: Yes, Peter, I would caution you not to extrapolate the comments on the national account commercial portfolio to the aggregate book of business, number one. Two, we're quite proud of the fact that we've had a high retention rate in aggregate across our businesses, and net growth year-over-year that has been profitable net growth year-over-year. My comments were specifically to the national account, and specifically to retention because the contractual cycle we were in with many cases had those cases out to bid, but our overall retention rate, when the dust settles, will be attractive. We would expect the ability to grow in 2015. I'm not giving you guidance. The strength of our regional segments, which is the largest segment of our portfolio, the strength of the select segment, which is the fastest growing portion of our portfolio, continues to perform very well. And in part, our aggregate enterprise retention is driven by just what you pointed at, a tremendous medical cost trend on a competitive basis that is benefiting clients and customers that we're serving. So overall, the portfolio is in good shape, and our commercial growth is expected to be positive, both competitively as well as in absolute terms next year. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. Is there anything you're going to do to address what's going on with the national accounts? Or is that just something you don't expect, going forward, to continue to be an issue? David M. Cordani: Yes, if you step back and look at the last handful of years, our performance in the national segments have been totally line with our strategic expectations. So holding share, changing profile of the business to more engagement incentive-based, and driving specialty program penetration. So for example, when we talk about 2015, you'll see further specialty penetration. So deepening share of wallet, which enables us to actually have deeper and broader clinical programs, which fuels our ability to deliver the returns for our clients, and we would expect to see continued success there. So there are no specific unique actions. We're just signaling the fact that we had a higher percentage of our book of business out to bid. You'll see a small variance in national accounts, which won't be a big variance for the enterprise in totality, given the strength of the regional and the select segment. Operator : The next question is from Dave Windley with Jefferies. David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : It's Dave Styblo, in for Dave Windley. A couple of questions. The first one is, could you just peel back the onion more on what is the source of the individual medical costing higher? Can you elaborate on what categories those are in, and the trends, are they accelerating, decelerating? What sort of prescription data versus claims data that you have on that book? And then more broadly, as we look forward, what exactly are the steps that you're looking to resolve that? Is it more pricing, network adjustments, medical management? That would be helpful. David M. Cordani: David, it's David. So I made a brief reference to this previously. So in the first tranche of lives that came on, we saw much, much higher utilization of services. So categories, I'm not going to give you the traditional inpatient, outpatient professional because it cuts across multiple categories, but think about major episodes of care : oncology, maternity, musculoskeletal, as examples. And some of those categories of care would tell you that it was pent-up demand or services in flight that are assumed in the portfolio. But the second tranche for the latter part of Q1, beginning part of Q2, suggests that a bit younger population, you make a reference to pharmacy, the combination of the demographics, and early analytics on pharmacy and the like, would infer somewhat of a healthier population, so opportunity to see some stabilization there. We need to see that play through the population as we go in the second half of the year. As it relates to actions, all of the above, right, product positioning, network sharpening, clinical management programs. And again, you have an under-served population in many cases that we need to get involved in clinical management. So all of those opportunities present positive dimensions to increase clinical quality and engagement, which will improve costs, which improves sustainably from affordability, but pricing, network and clinical management programs, all being targeted in specific geographies and specific programs for '15. David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then maybe to follow-up would just be on -- you did this a couple of times throughout the call, but on a more broad basis, how are you thinking about the 2015 head and tailwinds at this point? And are you willing to broadly characterize how you might see EPS growing next year? David M. Cordani: So David, it's David. So relative to '15, we're not going to provide guidance for '15 at this point. Consistently, it's too early in the cycle. Before I get to headwind and tailwinds, it's important to note that our underlying working assumption is that the '15 marketplace will continue to be a disrupted and challenging marketplace. Continuation of ACA implementation, Medicare revenue pressure version 2.0, the shakeout of the public exchanges, the global economy being fragile. In that context, we're proud of the fact that we have a well-positioning international business, that as we prefaced in our prepared remarks, the individual as well as the group portion of that are performing well. Secondly, a very well performing effective Group Insurance portfolio that has performed well and will continue to perform well, within the employer landscape, sustained traction within our largest segment, which is the regional segment, as well as our fastest-growing segment, which is the select portfolio. Against that backdrop, we have the disruption of ACA implementation, Medicare disruption public exchanges, and then lastly, for us, will continue to be the rate and pace of our strategic investments. We've been prudent. We've created the capacity to invest, but the rate and pace of our strategic investments, so both outside the U.S. and inside the U.S., will come into play in terms of the net guidance we provide as we approach 2015. Operator : The final question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Putting pressure on me there. I'll just ask you about 2 areas that you haven't been asked about. Any update on the PBM and -- both from the perspective of the integration of activities with Catamaran in the selling season? Then I know, from time to time, there's been discussion about capital allocation, strategy adjustments. Thanks for the comments in the prepared remarks, but any update are you thinking relative to dividends and/or any other changes in the capital allocation? David M. Cordani: A.J., it's David. I know you never whither on pressure, so no problem there. I'll address the PBM question, and I'll ask Tom to address the ongoing capital management philosophy and strategy. As we've discussed before, PBM is well-positioned and a strong performing asset. In fact, in our statistical supplement, you'll see continued growth in PBM lives. We took a couple of strategic steps to further advance our capabilities there, examples of share repurchasing leverage, access to a leverage of a leading technological platform and opportunities for future shared innovation. Programs tracking well is the headline. It's tracking well from the external marketplace. It's tracking well in terms of our operating plans. And as we go into the latter portion of this year, again, we'll continue to manage the rate and pace of investments in that program. But the net headline there is we continue to be pleased with our underlying value proposition, the overall program, and the marketplace feedback continues to be very positive. I'll ask Tom to talk about the ongoing capital management strategy and philosophy. Thomas A. McCarthy: Again, A.J., there's really not much news there. As you know, our preference is to deploy capital to support organic growth or find attractive shareholder value creation, creating acquisitions that we can deploy capital for. Absent that, right now, our primary vehicle to return capital to shareholders is share repurchase. We do periodically evaluate whether a dividend should play a more important in that, but right now, we haven't really made any change in direction. Operator : I will now turn the call over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David M. Cordani: Thank you for joining today's call. To conclude, I'd like to emphasize just a few key points from our discussion this morning. Cigna's second quarter results were strong, and reflect meaningful revenue and earnings contributions from each of our business segments. Our performance was driven by the continued effective execution of our clear and focused strategy, and the contributions of our more than 35,000 talented colleagues that work around the world. We continue to strengthen our differentiated distribution capabilities across our diversified businesses to improve the health, well-being and sense of security of the people we serve around the globe. Based in part on our first half performance, we are confident in achieving our increased outlook for 2014 on a full year basis, and we remain committed to achieving our long-term average annual EPS growth of 10% to 13%. Thank you, again, for joining us this morning and your continued interest in Cigna, and we look forward to continuing our discussion in the future. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's Second Quarter 2014 Results Review. Cigna Investor Relations will be available to respond to additional questions shortly.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the question-and-answer session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell. William McDowell : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's third quarter 2014 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2014. David will also provide insights on our expectations for 2015, as well as our over -- our long-term growth outlook. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as the principal measures of performance for Cigna and our business segments. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2014 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. First, please note that when we discuss the number of covered lives for our global medical customers, we will be doing so on a basis that excludes those individuals that were previously covered under Limited Benefits plans. As a reminder, we exited the Limited Benefits business as of December 31, 2013, as required by the Affordable Care Act regulation. Second, when we discuss our earnings outlook for 2014, it will be on the basis of adjusted income from operations. And finally, I would also note that when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior year development of medical costs. And with that, I will turn the call over to David. David M. Cordani: Thanks, Will. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Before we get started, I'd like to take a moment to thank Ted Detrick for his many years of leadership with Cigna. Ted has done an excellent job of communicating our business strategy and performance to the investment community, and we all wish him the best in his upcoming retirement. As you just heard, Will McDowell has already assumed the role of Head of Investor Relations. With his colleagues, Will and his team look forward to continuing the discussion with you as we look to our future. Now to begin, I'll review the highlights of our third quarter financial results. Next, we'll take a closer look at our transparent funding capabilities, in particular, within the Select Segment. This segment is one of our fastest-growing businesses where our expertise in tailoring unique offerings through a consultative approach continues to drive value for our customers and clients, as well as sustaining growth for Cigna. I'll then discuss our attractive long-term growth prospects across many of our established and growing markets, and address our strategic positioning in emerging markets. I'll also provide some high-level comments regarding our expectations for 2015. Then Tom will offer insights on our performance and our outlook as we enter the final quarter of the before we take your questions. And following the Q&A, I'll provide some closing remarks. We'll get started with some highlights. Cigna's strong performance in 2014 continued in the third quarter with solid revenue and earnings contribution across our businesses, highlighted by continued delivery of favorable medical costs and operating expense discipline in our Global Health Care business, and strong results in our Global Supplemental Benefits business, which continue to be driven by our differentiated distribution capabilities. Our third quarter 2014 consolidated revenue increased 9% to $8.8 billion. We reported adjusted income from operations for the third quarter of $519 million or $1.95 per share. In total, our third quarter results reflect strong, consistent performance, driven by continued effective execution of our strategy. Now I'll discuss the rapidly changing market for health care. Employers and individuals are increasingly recognized that health insurance's traditional role of financing sickness is no longer sufficient. And as such, are adapting programs that focus on health improvement, health risk reduction and value-based care delivery. By aligning the incentives of clients, customers and physicians, Cigna is delivering differentiated results. We've spoken about physician engagement before, and today, we're going to focus on client engagement via our Select Segment. I'll highlight how our efforts around engagement are delivering superior outcomes for clients and customers, as well as strong differentiated growth for Cigna. Across the U.S. today, more than 60% of covered workers are in plans that are completely or partially self-funded, while the vast majority of large firms participate in these plans, currently, there is much lower adoption rate for smaller firms. This represents a significant opportunity for Cigna, given the proven differentiated value we are delivering, fueled by our broad capabilities in this space. Our approach integrates a broad array of innovative specialty health services, along with our base medical offerings that ultimately lead to better health outcomes and differentiated results. The opportunity to provide value is clear as our customers and clients confront an array of challenges related to affordability, predictability and health status. One of our fastest-growing self-funded target markets is Cigna's Select Segment, a historically underserved market segment, where we customize solutions for employers with between 51 and 250 employees. The employees in the Select Segment constitute approximately 25 million lives of the 160 million employer life market. To effectively serve this segment, we apply our unique health and risk management capabilities to deliver customized solutions that ultimately drive savings for employers and their employees, while effectively managing overall health and medical outcomes, as well as employee productivity. And as for results, we have consistently delivered an industry-leading medical cost trend. For example, below 5% over the past few years. Cigna's actionable, company-specific clinical reports and wellness program data help Select Segment clients understand how their employees are using medical benefits, whether it be emergency room visits or out-of-network care. Cigna delivers recommendations and aligns incentives to improve affordability and value, including the identification of and paths to address emerging health risks. Risks that, if remain unaddressed, will result in significant health issues in the future. We help clients focus on prevention and health improvement by tailoring services such as health coaching and awareness, as well as support programs, including on-site biometrics and care management solutions, which is unprecedented in the small employer space, and which helps individuals maintain and improve their health, while also assisting with the recovery when they confront illness. The results here are clear, increasing demand for expertise in designing flexible, transparent plan offerings for these employers has driven mid-teens organic customer growth on an average annual basis over the last 5 years in this segment. Today's low market penetration of self-funded solutions in the Select Segment, which represents about 25%, coupled with the market proof points and value delivery of our innovative approach, presents a significant and exciting opportunity as we look to the future. This business is a great example of the type of growth that we expect to see over the long term in our commercial health care business. Now move to a broader view of the drivers of our long-term growth in a global business environment characterized by demand for affordable and high-quality care, shifting customer dynamics and changing market forces. As we execute our strategy, we continue to have a keen focus on where and how we add value for clients and customers, which in turn has resulted in strong revenue growth and attractive returns for our shareholders. As we look to the future, we plan to double Cigna's revenue base over the next 7 to 8 years, as we drive an 8% to 10% average annual revenue growth on an organic basis. We expect to attain this competitively attractive results through a strong execution of our multiple well-positioned avenues for growth. In our targeted commercial markets, in both the U.S. and overseas, our continued focus on health, wellness and value-based care delivery is driving improved health outcomes and translating it into strong retention and meaningful new customer growth. Taking into account the rapidly changing market environment, we expect high single-digit compounded annual revenue growth in our commercial employer business over the long term, reflecting both the dynamics of our focus market segments and the characteristics of clients that are attracted to our value proposition. In our U.S. individual business, we expect double-digit compounded annual revenue growth over the long term with the potential for even higher additional growth as the public exchange market evolves. In our Seniors markets, given the favorable demographics and Medicare advantage participation trends, combined with our very effective physician engagement model, we expect to grow revenue in the high-single digit range over the long term. In Group Disability and Life, our innovative productivity improvement programs are helping employees return to work at a faster pace, driving value for customers, as well as clients. Based on our focused, differentiated programs and results, we expect this segment to generate mid- to high-single digit growth rate over the long term. In the International markets, our deep experience and broad geographic reach over 30 countries and jurisdictions provide a strong foundation for us to serve the growing middle class and some of the world's most attractive markets. As we profiled on prior earnings calls, we expect the Global Supplemental Benefits business to deliver a mid-teens revenue growth on average over the long term. And we've build a foundation for sustained strong growth loan for the future through ongoing strategic investments in high-growth markets such as China, India and Turkey. When you couple this attractive organic growth outlook of 8% to 10% on an annual average basis with our industry-leading margins and strong cash flows, we expect to deliver differentiated earnings, significant free cash flow, and as a result, differentiated EPS. Now turning to 2015. We expect to deliver another year revenue, earnings and EPS growth. I'll provide a little color on how we will achieve this. Now to be sure, there are some headwinds for 2015, including a further increase in the industry tax. Our expectations of a rise in specialty pharmacy cost trend and, for planning purposes, the absence of favorable prior year reserve development. There could also be variability in the rate and pace of both medical cost utilization, as well as our spending for strategic investments. We will offset these headwinds and drive growth with a number of tailwinds. These include : continued growth in our medical customers; growth in Medicare Advantage customers; continued strong performance of our specialty products, including Pharmacy, Stop Loss and Dental; continued growth in our Global Supplemental Benefits business; further financial improvement in our individual public exchange business; and further operating expense efficiency. All in, we expect to leverage our multiple growth businesses to deliver revenue, earnings and EPS growth again in 2015. In addition, we expect our well-performing portfolio will again drive strong free cash flow levels to generate additional shareholder value creation opportunities. To summarize my remarks before Tom provides more detail on our results, Cigna's strong third quarter financial performance continues a track record of superior results and attractive revenue and earnings growth. We remain focused and continue to execute well in our target markets. We continue to create value for our clients and customers through unique industry-leading wellness and prevention offerings, as well as our innovative global marketing and distribution capabilities. We are strategically positioning Cigna to succeed in emerging market opportunities as they continue to evolve in a highly dynamic macroeconomic environment. And we are excited by our ability to double Cigna's revenue over the next 7 to 8 years and further expand the broad customer base that we have the privilege to serve around the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Thomas A. McCarthy: Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's third quarter 2014 results and discuss our outlook for the full year. This quarter's results are strong, driven by continued effective execution of our strategy. Key highlights in the quarter include consolidated revenues of $8.8 billion, which grew 9% by continued growth in our targeted markets, consolidated earnings of $519 million, quarterly earnings per share of $1.95 and continued strong free cash flow with $1.4 billion of share repurchase on a year-to-date basis. The strength of these results provides us with good momentum and confidence to increase our full year financial outlook for 2014. Regarding the segments, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Global Health Care delivered another good quarter with continued strong results in our employer group business, improving results in our individual business, and solid results from our Seniors business. Third quarter premiums and fees for Global Health Care grew 7% to $6.1 billion. This reflects continued good growth in our self-funded programs as demand for these products remained strong. We ended third quarter 2014 with 14.3 million global medical customers, growing by approximately 270,000 customers on a year-to-date basis. Third quarter earnings were $434 million and reflect business growth, operating expense efficiency, favorable medical cost and specialty contributions. Turning now to medical costs. Our commercial medical trend continues to be among the lowest in the industry. And given that over 85% of our U.S. Commercial customers are in transparent ASO funding arrangements, our clients directly benefit from these favorable medical costs. We continue to deliver medical costs that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization of care. Medical costs also reflect a continued low utilization trend. Regarding medical care ratios, our employer risk businesses continued to deliver strong results, reflecting strong pricing, disciplined underwriting and continued effective medical management and physician engagement. In our U.S. Commercial guaranteed cost business, our third quarter 2014 medical care ratio, or MCR, was 80.8% on a reported basis, or 81.1%, excluding prior year reserve development. This MCR reflects continued strong results in our employer group business, as well as improving results in our individual business. In our government business, our third quarter MCR for Medicare Advantage was 84.3% on a reported basis, or 84.6%, excluding prior year reserve development. Medicare Advantage results continue to reflect progress on the network and medical management actions we discussed in previous quarters, along with continued revenue pressure from the low reimbursement rate environment. Moving to operating expenses. For third quarter 2014, the total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 21.9%. This includes the impact of all health reformulated taxes, which added 110 basis points to the expense ratio in the quarter. To recap, we had another strong quarter in our Global Health Care business. Now I will discuss the results of our Global Supplemental Benefits business. This business continues to deliver very attractive growth and profitability. Premiums and fees grew 17% quarter-over-quarter for Global Supplemental. Third quarter earnings grew to $83 million, reflecting business growth and effective operating expense management. These results also reflect nonrecurring favorable tax items totaling $21 million after-tax. For Group Disability and Life, third quarter results reflect premium and fee increases of 7% over third quarter 2013. Third quarter earnings in our group business were $55 million, reflecting unfavorable claims experience in the Disability business. For our corporate and other operations, results totaled to an after-tax loss of $53 million for the third quarter of 2014, and this result includes an unfavorable tax item of $12 million reported in the Corporate segment. I would note that third quarter earnings in aggregate benefited from onetime tax items netting to $9 million after-tax with the previously mentioned favorability in our Global Supplemental Benefits business, partially offset by an unfavorable impact in corporate and other operations. Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, our third quarter results reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from each of our business segments, as well as significant free cash flow. Turning to our investment portfolio. In the third quarter, we recognized net realized investment gains of $15 million after-tax, coupled with a strong net investment income result. The high quality and diversification of our investment portfolio continues to drive our overall investment results. Now I will discuss our outlook for 2014. We expect to continue to deliver differentiated value for our customers and clients and strong financial performance for our shareholders in 2014. We now expect consolidated revenues to grow at the high end of our range of 5% to 8% over 2013. Based on the strength of our third quarter results, our outlook for full year 2014 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $1.95 billion to $2 billion, or $7.25 to $7.45 per share. This represents EPS growth of 7% to 10% over 2013, a strong result in a challenging year. Consistent with past practice, our outlook excludes any contribution from additional capital deployment and any prior year reserve development. As I noted in our second quarter earnings call, full year 2014 adjusted income from operations includes approximately $110 million after-tax or 40% per share of acquisition-related amortization expense. We are highlighting this information as it is our intent to exclude acquisition-related amortization expense from earnings and EPS estimates when we provide more specific 2015 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. I will now discuss the components of our 2014 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We expect full year Global Health Care earnings to be in the range of approximately $1.61 billion to $1.64 billion. Regarding global medical customers, we now expect 2014 customer growth to be at the high end of our outlook range of 1% to 2%. Turning to medical costs. We expect full year 2014 medical cost trend for a total U.S. Commercial book of business to be at the lower end of our 4.5% to 5.5% range. A range that we lowered in the second quarter. This improvement reflects continued individual engagement, effective medical cost management, physician engagement and low utilization trends. Regarding medical care ratios. For our U.S. Commercial guaranteed cost book of business, we now expect the 2014 MCR to be towards the middle of our current range of 81% to 82.5%, a modest improvement over our previous expectations. This reflects continued strong results in our employer group business and improved individual results. This outlook also anticipates a higher fourth quarter MCR due to an increased seasonality impact from the growing share of high-deductible plans in our employer group and individual businesses. For our Seniors business, the outlook for our Medicare Advantage MCR for 2014 is unchanged, and continues to be in the range of 84% to 85%. Regarding operating expenses for 2014, we now expect our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be at the low end of our current range of 22.5% to 23.5%. This outlook reflects increased spending for open enrollment costs and strategic initiatives in the fourth quarter, which will impact both the Global Health Care operating expense ratio, as well as adjusted income from operations. Now moving to the other components of our outlook. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth and earnings now in the range of $230 million to $240 million, an increase over our previous outlook. Regarding Group Disability and Life, we now expect full year 2014 earnings in the range of $310 million to $320 million, slightly below our previous outlook. Regarding our remaining operations, that is corporate and other operations, we now expect a loss of $195 million for 2014. So all in, for full year 2014, our outlook for consolidated adjusted income from operations is in the range of approximately $1.95 billion to $2 billion, or $7.25 to $7.45 per share. Now moving to our 2014 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have excellent financial visibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent with a strong return on capital in each of our business segments. Our capital deployment strategy and priorities have not changed. These priorities are : providing the capital to support the growth of our ongoing operations; pursuing M&A activity with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow in our targeted areas of focus; and after considering these first 2 items, we will return capital to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase. Regarding free cash flow, we ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $425 million. During the period July 31 through October 29, we repurchased 2.8 million shares of Cigna's common stock for $250 million, bringing our total year-to-date share repurchase to 16.3 million shares for $1.4 billion. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we now expect to have $500 million available for capital deployment during the balance of the year. Overall, our financial position and capital outlook remain strong. The high returns on capital from our businesses, coupled with our strong balance sheet, means we will continue to generate significant free cash flow to deploy for the benefit of shareholders. Now to recap. Our third quarter 2014 results reflect the strength of our diversified portfolio of global businesses, and a continued track record of effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals in our businesses remain strong, as evidenced by strong growth in revenue and earnings, industry-leading medical cost and quality outcomes and continued strong free cash flow. Based on the strength of these results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year 2014 earnings outlook. And with that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I guess, first on just the Exchange business. You talked about sort of improvement there. Can you just give us a sense of how you sort of saw that sequential improvement? And maybe where you stand on the 3Rs and whether that sort of helped cushion the third quarter relative to the second? And then maybe where margins are running on the exchange at this point? David M. Cordani: Ralph, it's David. There's about 7 questions in there. I'll try to take a few of those and ask Tom to give you a little bit of color. First, back to the Public Exchange business. For context, as you recall, about 3% of our total enterprise revenue is in the individual portfolio business. Secondly, as we indicated entering the year, we didn't expect that this portfolio would make money and that transpired, and we began to see additional pressure relative to that portfolio of business. But we committed to manage that within the overall portfolio of Cigna. In the third quarter, we saw some improvement to the performance relative to the first 2 quarters, driven by fundamental improvement in results in the third quarter, as well as some favorable evolution in terms of what the first and second quarter results were. Lastly, before I turn it over to Tom, you'll recall from the prior quarter's call, we indicated relative to the 3Rs that the majority of the position we had taken to date on the 3Rs were reinsurance-related. But as we got further into the year, we'd give additional insights, marketplace insights in terms of the other 2Rs and we have a little bit more of those insights for the third quarter. Tom, could you give a little bit more color on the 3Rs? Thomas A. McCarthy: Sure. Just a little more on the results in the quarter also, right? I mean, we did see some pretty strong improvement in results on the claims in the first 2 quarters. So they developed favorably from our initial estimates. Second, as David said, that dynamic carried over into third quarter. And then finally, we did get some more insight into some of the factors for estimating recoveries under the 3Rs. So as you recall from our previous comments, our visibility into some elements of the risk protection programs was limited before. And during the third quarter, we received some additional insight into relative performance that allow us to update our accruals. So through the third quarter, our accruals for the 3Rs are now total to about $130 million after tax. The majority of that accrual continues to be related to the reinsurance element of the 3R program. There are some for risk adjusters and a smaller amount for risk corridor recoveries. Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And one sort of follow-up. There's been a lot in the market around sort of shift to private exchanges, and potential for sort of dumping onto the exchange, particularly among small employers. David, I mean it sounds like you're suggesting pretty healthy growth in your Select Segment, which would somewhat go opposite that unless you're thinking you're going to be sort of a bigger player around some of those new marketplaces. So could you just reconcile sort of your statements relative to maybe what the thought process is in the market now about sort of greater shift away from ASO into risk? David M. Cordani: Two different dimensions. So I'll call it the Select Segment and then a little bit of more color on how we see the exchange marketplace more broadly. First, relative to the Select Segment. I think it's a great example and an important example of stepping back and not trying to lump all employers into any one bucket. So even within the Select Segment, which we define as 51 to 250 employees, so obviously excluding under 50, there are multiple micro-segments within there. And we tend to target on those employers who, as we say, value incentive- and engagement-based programs, who want to more actively work with their employee base to lower health risks, to improve health outcomes, to drive increase in productivity and see that as a fundamental part of running their business. That's not every employer of the 25 million lives that exist here, but it is a large cadre and we've had great success, as I noted in my prepared remarks, growing that on an average compounded basis of mid-teens in terms of covered lives. And we will continue to do so by leveraging our broad portfolio of businesses. As it relates to the private exchanges more broadly, as we've discussed, we see that as an early innovation marketplace, so early stages of development. We have capabilities, and we are participating in the vast majority of those markets, including our own proprietary exchange, which interestingly targets the Select Segment employer marketplace, as well as the regional segment marketplace. So over the long term, we see some good opportunities for growth here for both medical business, supplemental business, be it for active or retiree lives, as well as specialty business. So core growth in the Select Segment employer base, based on those focused on health risk reduction, health improvement productivity, leveraging our capabilities, well-positioned in the emerging, but just that emerging private exchange marketplace for both medical, supplemental and specialty business, and we see growth opportunities in both areas as we look to the future. Operator : The next question comes from Justin Lake with JPMorgan. Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : David, a number of your peers have taken the time in the third quarter call to comment on their comfort level with 2015 consensus EPS, which for Cigna implies about 10% growth year-over-year. I was hoping you might be able to give us some color here around how this view looks versus your internal expectations, excluding your move to cash EPS. David M. Cordani: We're not providing 2015 guidance at this point. I'll try to give you a little bit more color of how we look at the marketplace. First, jumping out of 2014, as Tom updated our outlook for 2014, that range brackets a 7% to 10% EPS growth rate, and it's something we're quite pleased about being able to deliver in this competitive marketplace. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we are committed to growing revenue earnings and EPS in 2015. There are multiple drivers of growth for us in terms of customer growth in both commercial and Medicare Advantage, continuation of our positive momentum in our broad specialty portfolio of businesses, continuation of momentum in our Global business, and continuation of operating efficiencies. In the face of that, there were some headwinds, which we discussed, industry tax, specialty pharma. As you know, we don't talk about or don't plan for reserve development. So all in, we're excited about being able to, once again, grow the corporation's top line and bottom line. We'll continue to invest, and we look forward to providing a detailed guidance next quarter. Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay, great. And then just on the exchanges. To get to the second quarter, we estimated, and I mean myself estimated, about $100 million of after-tax losses for exchanges were implied in the second quarter guidance. Can you give us an update here on how exchanges are going? Is that $100 million still ballpark in terms of losses this year? And where you might expect this to kind of go in 2015 in terms of getting better? David M. Cordani: It's David again. So to give you a little color around that, and I appreciate the way you described it, \"your estimate\". So if we step back last quarter, I would say, in the ballpark, your estimate is probably a little bit bearish. Per Tom's comments, you should expect that, that estimate has improved. So the loss is smaller this year. And if you think about Tom's comments relative to the medical care ratio, our range remains, for the medical care ratio outlook for the full year, but instead of being at the high end of the range, we're more in the middle part of the range. Throughout the course of the year, the employer book of business has been consistent, strong performing. So the delta there, Justin, is really the individual block of business. So we see some improvement relative to that. And, by the way, we still see the ability to improve the financial performance as we step into 2015 and beyond that. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : First question, just a clarification on 2014. Within -- there's always sort of a lot of moving parts, and I think, Tom, you broke out some one-timers this quarter. What's the sort of cumulative impact of one-timers, both positive and negative, in 2014 as like a starting point that we should think about? Thomas A. McCarthy: Josh, I'm not sure I could actually give you an orientation on that. Our results include some favorable and unfavorable one-time events as a normal course of business. We really just call them out to make sure you're better informed about what's going on in the results as opposed to trying to set a level for expectation going forward. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. Maybe we can talk about that separately. So next question, just on Stop Loss. On your offerings there, I'm just curious how those have continued to evolve in the marketplace. I'm curious if you're seeing or offering lower attachment points or aggregate or individual points and sales that are in the Stop Loss. And then any specific commentary on the impact from specialty pharmacy and if that's having an impact on rates that you guys are going to have to charge for 2015? David M. Cordani: Yes, it's David. Relative to Stop Loss, as you know, relative to us, we have a long history of a broad portfolio of Stop Loss programs, and those programs are pretty mature in the, what we call the regional segment. As you think about employers' needs, employers have fundamental needs for affordability, they have fundamental needs for predictability and they have fundamental needs for positive health and productivity outcomes for their employee base. So Stop Loss really fits into a predictability opportunity for the benefit of our employer clients. We've continued to expand those programs as part of our portfolio of services, and been able to grow that portfolio services every year with a variety of offerings, to your terminology, both aggregate and individual and continue to innovate those programs for the benefit of our employer clients. So continued growth, continued good market need and acceptance. Really around the peace of mind for our client to have predictability and, I'll call it, risk mitigation in any given year. Specific to specialty pharma, specialty pharma, as we've discussed in the past, continues to be probably the single highest trend category driver once you fragment all the medical cost categories. And we see that in 2014 within our underlying pharmacy trend across our portfolio of businesses. By the way, our aggregate medical cost trend is a very attractive competitive result in the 4.5% to 5% range. And secondly, as a flag for 2015, for the overall portfolio, we expect that specialty pharma will continue to provide a headwind trend that we will offset with our broad portfolio of other capabilities looking forward. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : So it doesn't sound like specialty pharmacy is creating any specific dislocation in the market. I mean, I am just thinking about attachment points of say $50,000 being a big difference in hep C for example, today versus last year. So -- but it doesn't sound like that's creating a big difference in the way you're approaching the market. David M. Cordani: Josh. I appreciate your follow-up. So if you break specialty pharma down, if you think about in the broad portfolio of comprehensive medical offerings, no. It's a driver, but as our results demonstrate, offset with all the other active management programs. Secondly, to your point on Stop Loss, not a triggering event. Broadly speaking, I wouldn't think about that as a triggering event. Thirdly, as you think about pharmacy specific offerings that only focus on pharmacy, then you're going to have more of a leveraged effect there. So if you think about the pharmacy offering more primarily, you'll have a leveraged effect there but broadly in our commercial book of business, that's integrated with our medical offering. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank. Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : First of all, I just want to extend my best wishes to Ted as well on his retirement. And then, just moving -- just a first question. Just interested on Medicare Advantage and if you can give us some early observations on how the annual enrollment period is going for HealthSpring? David I know you mentioned that you do expect growth in MA enrollment for next year, so just interested if you think that the business could return to more of a market type growth rate for MA for 2015. David M. Cordani: Scott, so relative to MA, again, we're not providing detailed guidance but as I noted in prepared comments, we expect to grow our covered lives from an MA standpoint. To remind you, we always focus on the individual MA market, we're not really focus on the employer MA marketplace. Based on a look at the competitive environment, and especially our critical Go Deep markets, we are pleased with our net positioning of our overall benefit offerings, our price point, the ability to continue to leverage our collaborative physician relationships, and we're looking forward to having a good growth year as we step into 2015 for the MA marketplace in terms of covered lives for the vast majority of our Go Deep markets. As you know, there were some markets where we're repositioning. There are some markets that we're investing and entering. So I think about it in terms of the mature markets. Well, very good results there based on what we're seeing right now. Finalizing some repositioning markets and then our indicators are relative to the markets we're investing into growth, the new markets we've opened up, early indicators there positive as well. Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And then just I had a follow-up question, just around Select and just interested in terms of on the cost side whether you saw any type of cost issues emerge there. Obviously, one of the competitors did cite seeing some pressure there, not sure if it's sound like the employer business. It sounds like the cost trends overall have remained very favorable, but just interested if you could spike out on the Select Segment there. David M. Cordani: Your headline conclusion is correct. We've seen no spikes and Scott, I think it's important to step back and understand how we attempt to go-to-market there and how we focus the programs. So they're beyond the traditional insurance offerings. As noted in my prepared remarks, the health engagement, the diagnostic programs, the ability to do on-site biometrics illustratively for 100-life or 125-life employer, on-site health coaching, et cetera, all of that is paying dividends. First, for the employer and the employees and as such, for us as we go forward. But overall, we are really pleased with the medical cost trend that we're able to deliver and adjacent to that, therefore, the medical cost quality we're also delivering for those clients in the Select Segment. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I'm just trying to understand the guidance for the last bit of the year here in the context that I think last quarter, or after last quarter you guys talked about overall and health care earnings being relatively level between 3Q and 4Q. And looks like you did quite a bit better in 3Q than that implied. And a number of things moving favorably for you, so why not raise the overall health care guidance? And why now have this lower view of 4Q? And if it's seasonality, is there something that makes you think that, that seasonality is stronger than your view maybe 3 months ago? David M. Cordani: David, just a couple of comments and I'll ask Tom to tease out a couple of specifics. Most importantly, overall, we're very pleased with our 2014 results to date and our 2014 outlook as the range for 2014 indicates a 7% to 10% EPS growth rate in this marketplace is a very positive outcome. Secondly, you've hit upon an important point. There is seasonality in the fourth quarter. There's seasonality in the makeup of the medical benefit, so I'll ask Tom to reiterate and give you more color on, as well as our spending pattern, both the fundamental spending pattern running the business as well as our discretionary spending pattern of our ongoing investments. Those are the 2 categories I would highlight. And off the strength of our portfolio, we will continue to make sure we're investing for the long haul as well. So Tom, could you give a little more insights on the fourth quarter seasonality as it relates to MCR, and then maybe a little color on where the spending uptick is in the fourth quarter? Thomas A. McCarthy: Sure. So -- again, as I mentioned in my remarks, we are expecting and had seasonality in the fourth quarter MCR, and that's largely due to the growing share of the high-deductible plans in both our employer group and individual businesses. And as individual has grown, they tend to be leaning towards more higher deductible plans and even in our employer group plans, we tend to have more high deductible plans this year than prior years. So combined with the normal seasonality for underlying medical costs in the fourth quarter, which typically, we do have more medical expenses because of the -- during the fourth quarter. We do expect our MCR to increase both sequentially and quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2014. So just to reiterate, the fundamentals of the business remain strong and this impact that we're anticipating simply reflects seasonality in the mix shift dynamics and is fully contemplated in the guidance that you referenced. Now on expenses, again, we have the normal seasonality drivers of one-one readiness, probably more invested in open enrollment and clearly, we have some options on strategic initiative investments that probably weigh more heavily on the quarter. I'd also point out, Matt, in the quarter-over-quarter dynamics, we had anticipated a tax benefit in the fourth quarter that actually got accelerated into the third quarter. So that also changes the dynamic a little bit from our earlier expectation. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : All right, that's fine. And just lastly, is a follow-up. On the disability claims pressure, is that something you expect will abate in the next quarter going into next year? Thomas A. McCarthy: Just to give some high-level comments in group first and then get to that specific point. I mean, we have our group business viewed as a very attractive part of portfolio. We've got a differentiated model with a focus on health and productivity that delivers great value for clients, customers and shareholders. And have a track record of solid revenue growth and strong return on capital in this business, in what has been a very challenging economic climate. As I mentioned in my remarks, there is some higher visibility benefit ratio this quarter, mainly related to higher average claim size. And while we do expect some variability quarter-to-quarter in this business, we do expect group results to improve in the fourth quarter. And I'm confident that our differentiated capabilities that I referenced earlier will allow us to continue to drive value for both customers and shareholders in this business. Operator : The next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : National selling season and also anything that's renewed. How are you feeling about the national selling season? And also, there were some gnits and gnats second quarter that elevated some of the other MLRs. I'm sensing something may have happened there. Third quarter, is there anything kind of onetime to call out in the other businesses, say experience rated Stop Loss, those? David M. Cordani: And it's David. I'll give you little color on the National Account segment, and ask Tom to comment on the MLRs. The headline relative to national accounts is no new news from what we discussed on last quarter's call. So to remind you, very importantly, we defined this segment more tightly than the marketplace norms. So commercial employers with 5,000 or more employees that are multistate. As we define it, that is a shrinking market place due to the U.S. employment patterns in the current environment. Our goal has been, and continues to be to hold share overall, but to continue to evolve our share as it relates to geographic depth of where those covered lives are as well as the percent that are engagement- and incentive-based. For 2015, the new business opportunities that we had the opportunity to bid on were about the same percentage over the prior year, and our look at our close ratio and our ability to win is about the same year-over-year. The percent of our business that was up to bid for '15 versus '14 was up a bit, and that was relative to procurement cycles of the nature of the business for 2015. Our retention rates over the average of it will continue to be strong, but because there's a little higher percentage out to bid, they'll be a little higher percentage of loss. Net net, no massive change in terms of the patterns, and with the ongoing strength of our Select and regional portfolio of business as I noted in my prepared remarks, we expect to again grow our customer base in 2015. Tom, could you give a little color on the loss ratios? Thomas A. McCarthy: Sure. Christine, again, with respect to the group of businesses that are outside of our guaranteed cost MCRs, so that would be the variety of lines, the shared return, Stop Loss, dental, et cetera that are outside of the guaranteed cost MCRs. As I've talked about before, those lines all behave a little differently so you need to be careful in looking at that very narrow MCR result. But business-wise, there's no news to report there, things are performing as we'd expect and as it happens, this quarter, if you do the math, at least as we've done the math, on the risk ratio result for that segment of the business, it's about 77.1%. And that is pretty much consistent with the sequential results in the second quarter of 77%. So not really seeing anything even in the overall metric. And certainly, as we look at the business fundamentals, there's nothing to call out as unusual. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Great. Just wanted to go back to your kind of long-term guidance, which was helpful to think about. You kind of focused on the top line. Any thoughts on kind of how margins develop over that time, whether it's just based upon the relative growth rates of the different products kind of whether you see a little bit of margin compression, just trying to think whether we should expect organic earnings growth to approximate the revenue number that you talked about, or whether we should think about something a little bit less organically? David M. Cordani: Kevin, it's David. I appreciate the follow-up here. First and foremost, we're quite pleased with the strategic positioning of the businesses we talked about. So the broader Commercial Employer business, the U.S. and Global, the ability to grow that high single-digits; the individual business, double-digit; the international business, mid-teens; seniors, high single-digits; group, mid- to high single-digits. As it relates to your margin question, a little color or way of thinking about it, natural headwinds for a business over this time horizon like ours, there'll be natural headwinds that will trigger margin compression just as a normal course of business. The ability to offset that will be predicated on -- be on growth, and just basic fixed cost leveraging. The ability to combat that will be continued innovation to be able to deliver value of a diverse portfolio of businesses. Operating efficiency gains beyond just traditional fixed cost leveraging. Over this horizon, all things remaining equal, when you look at the makeup of this business portfolio, it would suggest that run rate margins will be similar, natural headwinds will push a little bit in the face, maybe they decrease them somewhat. And as long as we are committed to ongoing innovation, we should be able to mitigate most of that, but not all of it. So if I was to predict out 8 years, all other things remaining equal, I'd say probably a little margin headwind off of a scale of a business that doubled in size. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just -- the other follow-up question would be on the 3Rs. Because I think you said $130 million of accruals, I think last quarter, you had $65 million. And I thought that you said that you're expecting to have only $65 million in the back half of the year total. Am I right on that? So it feels like the 3R growth is a little bit higher than what you thought last quarter. And if it is, how you reconcile that with the improved results there? Thomas A. McCarthy: Kevin, it's Tom. I think we suggested kind of the running rate would continue into the last half of the year. So the accrual is maybe a little bit higher, but really, in the same general ballpark. And one of the reasons that it is a little tricky to talk about the 3Rs, is they are so interrelated. So the components are a little different, but in the same general ballpark. And I would expect as we said last quarter, that kind of the run rate is generally the same going into the fourth quarter, maybe a little more, but nothing materially different in the overall scheme of things. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : And just to be clear, you're now talking about a risk corridor and a risk adjuster, both of those would be receivables? Thomas A. McCarthy: Yes. Operator : The next question comes from Carl McDonald with Citigroup. Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I'm going to ask Josh's question around the onetime benefits or benefits from favorable development. So it looks like in health care, you've called out, order of magnitude $55 million after tax in favorable development this year. So as we think about the outlook into '15, would you take the -- call it the midpoint of the health care guidance, $1.62 billion back out the $55 million and use that as the base to grow into 2015? Anything you'd change in that assumption? David M. Cordani: It's David. As you know, we do not project reserve development. As reserve development unfolds, we obviously create clarity relative to that. So I'd invite you to draw your conclusions relative to that. I think the important headline here when you think about reserve development, is you step back and say what's driving that? What's driving that is fundamental execution and consistency in terms of delivery of positive medical cost outcomes. And what we're pleased with is our sustained track record of setting a goal relative to medical cost outcomes, and it you look at the medical trend outlook for the corporation that we've achieved or improved year-after-year and delivered at the lower level. There's a lot that contribute to that. Alignment of individual incentives, objectives and engagement, alignment of physician incentives and engagement et cetera, but as it relates to the math, I'd invite you to draw your conclusions. When we provide guidance for '15 we'll clearly articulate what the basis of that guidance is, but we continue not to take a posture of projecting any reserve development. Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And then separately on the -- as you think about the competitive environment for the nonrisk Select Segment, just any general commentary on how competitive that business is? And then just maybe a thought on how easy is it for other companies to get into? My suspicion is that having a successful large group ASO business, does not necessarily prepare a company well to get into the Select Segment. David M. Cordani: Carl, so a little bit more color relative to that and to your question, I think you underscore within your question, there's multiple buyer's and buying types within the Select Segment. So as we noted, it's a group of about 25 million lives. So it's a large segment. It's a large segment, therefore it's a diverse segment. Secondly, as we've seen over the years, the percent of new business sales in that segment have continue to grow as it relates to transparent funding versus risk, but we continue to offer both of those funding alternatives. It's a competitive market. The market is a competitive marketplace and the key to success is your ability to deliver results. A couple points of differentiation that we have and continue to invest in. One, the core capabilities around just transparency and aligning incentives and objectives. Two, a very diverse portfolio of specialty businesses that need to line up, including the clinical engagement capabilities of being able to do on-site biometrics, virtual health coaching, on-site health coaching, et cetera. And then finally, an important point just to tease out a little bit, it's the client management and service staff that wraps around it that delivers what we'll call employer reporting and actionable insights to the employer and their broker intermediary, if they work with a broker, to illuminate where and how the drivers are cost health risks engagement opportunities exist? That's very difficult to replicate over the scale that we're talking about because it's easy to do that for a 100,000-life or a 10,000-life employer. It's difficult to do it in scale, monthly or quarterly for the number of cases it would take at 100 lives or 125 lives. But this is an area where innovation will continue, and we'll continue investing, innovating our capabilities, talent, insights on a go-forward basis. And finally as I noted, this scenario where we see continued tremendous growth opportunity because there's great value creation for those clients. Operator : And next question comes from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Just wanted -- I know you're not giving guidance for 2015, but I was hoping you can talk around 2 items. The losses in the ACA compliant book. Obviously, we all have our own estimates, but how much -- what percentage do you think is the reasonable amount of losses you could claw back? And then second, on the Catamaran partnership, is it still about $0.25 additive to next year's EPS? David M. Cordani: Chris, it's David. So on the ACA book, so -- we'll talk a little bit more broadly relative to our individual block of business. As indicated with our prior question, our -- we entered the year with the expectation that we would lose money and we would manage that within our overall portfolio. We're -- by the way, we're achieving that goal. And earlier this year, we indicated that those losses grew. This quarter we're indicating that, that rate of growth is a abated a little bit and results are improving, but still at a loss pattern. Secondly, we will improve that result in 2015, but to be clear, by no means do we project in 2015 that, that will be a run rate level of targeted and sustainable margins of 3% or better. So it'll be a less of a loss in 2015. And we don't view this clawing back. We view this as 2014, '15, '16, a really version 1.0 of this marketplace, and we're being highly focused on where and how we're playing in the market. As it relates to our pharmacy business more broadly, step back and put that in context. First, we continue to be very excited about our PBM asset. We continue to own and operate a very well-performing PBM asset and that we further strengthened with bulk purchasing leverage through mail-order fulfillment leverage, through the ability to leverage an innovative technology platform. The headline here is good progress on all of the above, good progress on the organization's ability to move forward relative to that. As it relates to your specific question, let me give you a little bit color. We looked at 2014 as a transitional year and 2015 as a run rate year. So the easiest way for that to be internalized as your reference is, we said the run rate year is $0.50 of EPS accretion. Therefore, the transitional year, you can think about half of that. The good news is we're ahead of our trajectory for 2014, largely driven by our own rate and pace of internal investments that we had assumed to be able to drive various initiatives within our Pharmacy business. So headline one is we are ahead of trajectory relative to 2014, largely driven by the rate and pace of our own internal activities. Secondly, line of sight to the run rate for 2015 remains intact. As a result, the Delta between '14 and '15 will be less than the implied $0.25. But most importantly, the run rate is there and maybe with a little upside as we continue to innovate within our overall PBM capabilities. Operator : The next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Just a couple of well, quick ones hopefully. But the first one was on the Part D business, I know this is a very specific one, but it looked like year-to-year, you were up about 1,300 basis points in your MLR and that created even though a small bit of a year-to-year headwind for you. What -- anything to call out there? Or highlight? Thomas A. McCarthy: A.J., it's Tom. So as you know, the Part D business tends to have a lot of variability quarter-to-quarter and this quarter, does include some timing-related items. So I'd suggest you focus on the year-to-date results to get a picture of where things are headed here rather than just looking at the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we're also running a little behind last year about 250 basis points worth, worse. Mainly 2 factors driving this. First, is the impact of somewhat higher-than-anticipated specialty drug costs, including Sovaldi. And then second is an increased mix of higher cost brand drugs that we had expected in the portfolio. I'd note that our outlook reflects continuation of these pressures into the fourth quarter. We do expect to make network and formulary adjustments to ultimately help mitigate these impacts over time. Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And then as the follow-up. The comment was made about -- David about International mid-teens sort of growth into the future. Can you just comment a, any particular areas near term this quarter and looking in the fourth quarter that are doing particularly well, any challenges? And then does that long-term outlook corporate a broadening footprint, or can you do that type of growth with the existing base of business you have now? David M. Cordani: A.J., so as we're talking about that mid-teens, we're talking about the international individual business. So strong performing asset, variety of countries that we operate in today. Remind you of the core capabilities. Our core capabilities, there are really marketing and consumer insights that enable us to microsegment the current and emerging middle class and our target markets match specific solutions to those microsegments and importantly, match what we call, preference-centric distribution campaigns around those microsegments. And we continue to iteratively go at that in our target markets. So the drivers of growth here are really 3 things. First, in our existing markets that we're focused on, continued evolution of economic growth is growing in ever present middle class and the need statement matches up very nicely relative to our capabilities. Second, our ability to innovate in those markets further to expand our portfolio of solutions for our existing customers, because we want to be a solution provider of choice for those customers off of my first point. And then third is to expand geographies. So currently as you know, we took the step to expand into Turkey. That is performing very well for us. We're making the strategic investments to expand in India. We started selling business earlier this year, and the rate and pace of continuing to expand in those countries as well as additional countries will continue on a go-forward basis. Taking it all together, this is an exciting growth segment for us that we will continue to invest in both the capabilities from a technological standpoint and geography and then talent necessary to continue that growth rate. Operator : Mr. Rice, the next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Again following up on the margin profile for a couple of businesses from a normalized basis. I think you've seen about a couple of years of margin compression on Medicare, at least on the MLR. This year, looking forward into '15 and beyond, do you think you're MLR will settle out at the 84 to 85? Or is there any potential to bring it back closer to what you had with HealthSpring, either through pricing of Stars or network strategies and whatever? David M. Cordani: Ana, it's David. As it relates to margins in Medicare more specifically per our prior discussions. We today, are not at our margin objectives. So to be clear, we see upside opportunity here. Secondly, as it relates to the drivers of it. Number one, our benefit positioning in our chosen Go Deep markets continues to be strong. Two, we'll step out of this year with a very good Stars position, an improving Stars position further going into '16 and further improvements that we see beyond that. And third, the Go Deep markets benefit by proven physician partnerships and physician relationships. So to your point, as you framed it, as we look to '15, '16, '17, we see the ability to move the margin forward but we're going to be smart relative to that and balance it versus our growth objectives as we continue to drive forward. So we're not at our objective today, upside opportunity going forward, and we'll be disciplined in terms of balancing that with our growth objectives. Operator : The next question comes from Sarah James with Wedbush. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : Your peers have been talking about pricing to a 50 to 150 basis point cost trend uptick in 2015. So it's the largest increase that we've seen in recent years. Can you touch on the cost trend that you've been baking into your 2015 renewals so far? David M. Cordani: Sarah, it's David. Again, we're not providing '15 guidance. The way to think about it is if you step back and look at our prior years, we've tended to build a bit of an uptick in trend relative to what we had in any given year under the notion that we may see some additional utilization trend and/or as I flagged earlier, specialty Pharma trend. So we're pleased with the '14 trend outlook of 4.5% to 5.5% and, as Tom noted, trending towards the low ends of the range. You should assume that we build that trend up based on our known contracting and then utilization assumptions. And most probably, it will be upticked a little bit relative to next year. Final point I would make here and very importantly, when you think about our portfolio business, I'd ask you to remember, that about 80-plus percent of it is transparent funding mechanisms. Another portion of it is assured returns, and then when you get into the guaranteed cost portfolio, because we don't play in the under-50-life book of business. In most cases, we are pricing those accounts based upon the experience within those accounts. With a lot of back and forth and dialogue with clients, so aggregate trend assumptions are interesting, but client-specific experience is what's important, and that's a part of how we work, whether it's in the ASO space, the shared return space or even by the inherent makeup of our guaranteed cost book of business because we're not in the pooled products of under-50, so just a little color, I think it's important and differentiated for us. Operator : The next question comes from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : So just -- I appreciate your comments earlier on your expectations or priorities around capital deployment. Maybe just provide a little more color around that, with particular advances on maybe your appetite for M&A? Or is there any capabilities within maybe Medicare or even Medicaid that you feel like you need to acquire to help gain sufficient scale? David M. Cordani: Sure. Relative to capital deployment, Andy, and acquisition specifically, first, when you think about capital deployment you need capital with which to deploy, and we continue to be very pleased with the positioning of our businesses and the ability to produce the sustained free cash flow that we're able to produce off of a base that, as Tom noted in his prepared remarks, we have well-capitalized operating subsidiaries to start with. As it relates to our capital priorities, they remain unchanged and our second priority is to pursue strategically attractive and financially attractive M&A. Our priorities there remain consistent. So to further expand our seniors capabilities, including the capabilities that serve the dual-eligible population. Second, is to further expand our global footprint. Third, expand our retail capabilities further and fourth, what we'll call local density plays, which typically fall more in the tuck-in category framework. And we have the capital positioning to do so. And as we've proven in the past, when we've taken action, we have a proven track record of being on strategy in converting those acquisitions to positive shareholder outcomes as we execute those acquisitions. Operator : And the next question comes from Brian Wright with Sterne Agee. Brian M. Wright - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Just wanted a little clarification on the 3Rs because I thought last quarter, you said the $60 million to $65 million after tax included -- was mostly reinsurance, so I thought that would imply some risk -- the risk corridor and maybe some risk adjustment. So I just want to understand like they're going up to $130 million this quarter, how that is kind of just within the range after all the 3Rs? Because that could be like 550 basis points on the guaranteed cost MLR. Thomas A. McCarthy: Well, Brian, again, you've kind of got the dynamics right. The reinsurance is still the largest share of the estimate. Last quarter, I think, we commented that we didn't make any -- or maybe we didn't comment, but we didn't include any estimate for risk adjustors, we just didn't have any information. And as information has become available, we've been able to make a risk adjustor estimate, but it basically has moved around some of the estimates in the other Rs over time. So we're really, generally on the same trend as we thought we'd be, maybe a little more accrual in the 3Rs, but in the same ball park. Operator : Our final question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Maybe a little granular, but on the Medicare Advantage book. In 2014, I guess, my understanding is the repositioning that Herb and the team have done is largely focused in Pennsylvania, and the membership declines there are what is kind of holding back membership growth for MA this year. I guess, I'm wondering if those same dynamics play out into 2015, and how -- kind of coming back to an earlier question, how we should really think about member growth for MA, relative to kind of market growth in light of that dynamic? David M. Cordani: David, it's David. You have a pretty good recall, so let me add a couple more pieces and then talk about the prospective piece. We had a couple of items going on in 2014. One, when we provided guidance for '14, I'd ask you to recall that we indicated that there were certain markets that we would fundamentally exit and we categorized that as 2 to 3 points. Additionally, beyond that, there were some repositioning and retrenchment and that's the part you recall. But there was 2 items that were in play. Largely in 2015, you don't need to think about large-scale market exits, number one. Two, there's finalization of some repositioning. But three, offsetting that, there is further traction relative to the new market entr\u00e9e, investments from 2014 and county expansion in 2015. Taking it as a whole, our covered life performance or our customer growth performance for MA will be positive and attractive in 2015 versus the repositioning in 2014. Operator : I will now turn the call over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David M. Cordani: Thanks, just to conclude our call this morning, I want to emphasize a few key points. Our strong third quarter results reflect solid revenue and earnings contributions from each of our business segments. This performance was driven by the many contributions of our more than 35,000 dedicated colleagues across the world, who bring our strategy and mission to life every day. We're continuing to build and strengthen our global capabilities and consultative expertise to fulfill our mission of improving the health well-being, and sense of security of the individuals we serve. Based in part on our performance over the past 3 quarters, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our elevated 2014 outlook, and we expect meaningful revenue growth over the next 7 to 8 years, with the goal of doubling our revenues, leveraging our business in established growth markets and potential emerging marketplaces. As a result we remain committed to achieving our average annual EPS growth target of 10% to 13% over the long term. Thanks for joining our call, and we look forward to continuing our discussion in the future. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's third quarter 2014 results review. Cigna Investor Relations will be available to respond to additional questions shortly. A recording of this conference will be available for 10 business days, following this call. You may access the recorded conference by dialing 1 (888) 678-8551 or 1 (402) 220-6451. No passcode is required. Thank you for participating. We will now disconnect.",

Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by for Cigna's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Results Review. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell. William McDowell : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's full year 2014 financial results as well as our financial outlook for 2015. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled \"adjusted income from operations\" and \"earnings per share\" on this same basis as the principal measures of performance for Cigna and our business segments. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2015 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. First, please note that when we discuss the number of covered lives for our global medical customers, we will be doing so on a basis that excludes those individuals that were previously covered under Limited Benefits plans. As a reminder, we exited the Limited Benefits business as of December 31, 2013, as required by the Affordable Care Act regulation. Second, please note that our definition of adjusted income from operations will change for 2015 reporting in that we will now exclude acquisition-related amortization expense from this operating measure. When we discuss our earnings outlook for 2015 today, it will be on a basis of adjusted income from operations that excludes acquisition-related amortization expense. This is a change compared to the basis on which 2014 results are reported and how we have previously provided our 2014 outlook. In 2015, the impact of excluding acquisition-related amortization expense is approximately $100 million after tax or $0.40 per share. Third, beginning in 2015, we have simplified our guidance and disclosures for our medical care ratios or MCRs by reporting them on a basis of total Commercial and total Government. The total Commercial ratio encompasses all of our commercial risk products, including medical, pharmacy, dental, stop loss and behavioral products, provided through guaranteed cost or experience-rated funding arrangements in both the United States and internationally. The total Government ratio includes our Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D and Medicaid businesses. To ease the transition, we have provided historical medical care ratios on these bases within our quarterly financial supplement that was posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com this morning. Lastly, consistent with past practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior year development of medical costs. Our outlook also excludes the impact from our recently announced acquisition of QualCare, which we do not expect will have a material impact to our financial results in 2015. And with that, I will turn the call over to David. David M. Cordani: Thanks, Will. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. To begin, I'll review highlights of our full year 2014 financial results and our 2015 outlook. I will then discuss how we will continue to create value for our customers, clients and shareholders in the future. I will also illustrate more specifically how we are creating value in our Seniors business and leveraging our experience and success of that business to drive long-term growth. Then Tom will address our fourth quarter and full year 2014 financial performance in more detail as well as provide the specifics for our outlook for 2015 before we take your questions. And following the Q&A session, I'll wrap up the call with a few closing remarks. We'll start with some highlights from the year. Cigna's strong 2014 performance represents the fifth consecutive year of competitively attractive financial results. This outstanding track record of results is driven by the disciplined execution of our growth strategy, all while we continue to invest in new capabilities, expand our offerings and our geographic footprint. Over the past several years, in the face of a particularly challenging and dynamic environment, we have been focused and disciplined with targeted yet meaningful investments to drive innovation, including new clinical programs, aligned incentives for customers, expanded technologies and programs for health care professionals. We have done all this while delivering competitively differentiated results year in and year out. The full year 2014 consolidated revenues increased 8% to $35 billion, with each business segment delivering strong growth over 2013. We reported adjusted income from operations for the full year of $2 billion or $7.43 per share, which represents a per share increase of 9% over 2013. Our revenue and earnings performance reflect growth in all of our businesses over the course of the year, a year in which we also grew to more than 85 million customer relationships worldwide and where we continue to generate strong margins and significant free cash flow for the benefit of shareholders. These results position us to once again deliver competitively attractive revenue and earnings growth in 2015. For 2015, our outlook of 8% to 10% revenue growth and 5% to 10% EPS growth, excluding reserve development recognized in 2014 as well as future capital deployment, reflects the focus and clarity of our strategy and continued strong performance of our team around the world. Tom will walk you through more specifics regarding our outlook later on the call. Now I'd like to talk about how our guiding framework, global strategy and multiple avenues for growth have enabled our long track record of success and will drive ongoing future value creation. Across our business, we operate in an ever-changing market landscape with diverse needs across customers, employers, health care professionals and governments. Moving [ph] in this market, we are meeting and exceeding the expectations of our customers and clients around the world by delivering affordable and personalized solutions. As we look to the future, we have built a growth framework to create ongoing value, leverage our differentiated capabilities for the benefit of our customers. There are 3 components to this framework. First is leveraging our well-positioned existing portfolio of businesses to continue to generate attractive value for our customers and clients. We expect to double the size of our company over the next 7 to 8 years. This will result in an average annual revenue growth rate of 8% to 10%, largely driven by our existing portfolio and focused execution. This continues a track record that we have demonstrated over the last 5 years, and our 2015 outlook of 8% to 10% revenue growth is consistent with this goal. The second component is targeted and effective capital deployment to create ongoing shareholder value. I would note that, over the past 5 years, we have effectively deployed capital through a balance of investments in our business portfolio, strategic M&A and share repurchase. A good recent example of this is our agreement to purchase QualCare Alliance Networks. This acquisition is directly aligned with our Go Deep and our physician partnership strategies. Our businesses are generating high margins and are capital efficient, allowing us to both fund attractive organic growth and generate significant free cash flow. This free cash flow provides us with financial flexibility and the opportunity to deploy capital to create additional value for our shareholders. And given the health of our balance sheet and underlying capitalization level of our subsidiaries, we expect to have $1.8 billion of capital available for deployment in 2015. The third component of our framework where we seek to drive additional value for our shareholders is through new and emerging opportunities. These opportunities include new distribution marketplaces such as public and private exchanges, geographic expansion such as new Medicare Advantage markets and international opportunities, and new buying [ph] segments and service expansion such as medical service organization offerings for the benefit of integrated health care professionals. We are well positioned to pursue each of these potentially attractive future growth opportunities that are aligned with our strategy. As such, we have dedicated resources to fuel future expansion in these areas. To illustrate how we are leveraging this framework to create value, I'll highlight how this framework applies to our Seniors business. This market segment includes a population with a variety of complex needs, requiring customer engagement and incentive-based clinical resources and programs to drive ongoing success. Our Seniors business pioneered successful physician engagement models, including aligned incentives and collaborative relationships to drive high-quality and a more affordable health care experience for both customers as well as physicians. As we continue to leverage our core physician engagement capabilities across all of our health services businesses, we are focused on key investments that improve affordability, enhance personalized services and drive better clinical outcomes. For example, the strategic investments we're making to enhance our physician insight and data tools will enable our clinical data to be accessible in a real-time fashion for more of our physician partners as well as our service teams. Enabled by our physician engagement model, seniors continue to find our Cigna HealthSpring benefit offerings increasingly compelling. And we expect to have 6% to 8% Medicare Advantage customer growth in 2015. As for positioning, we continue to be amongst the top 3 players in market share for all of our established markets, and we are posting attractive growth in our newer markets. In 2014, we expanded our Seniors business into Georgia and the Carolinas, where we successfully leveraged existing Cigna commercial networks to develop and implement engaged physician relationships for seniors. Importantly, the quality of care delivered through our engaged physician groups is reflected in our stars ratings, where we increased our membership in 4-star or higher plans from approximately 40% to nearly 60% in 2016. Looking to 2017, we again expect to deliver an increase in this result. These improvements in star ratings have allowed us to enhance our benefit offerings and position our Seniors business to be an earnings accelerant in 2016 and beyond. Relative to our expanding opportunities, we currently operate Medicaid into eligible plans in Texas and in the Illinois markets. Here, we are leveraging our care coordination capabilities to serve the dual-eligible population within our Medicaid platform. Focusing our growth efforts on improving care for the underserved, including the dual-eligible and aged, blind and disabled populations, complements our proven experience with complex care coordinations, differentiated clinical outcomes and affordability focus. While our Illinois plan is relatively new, having just begun in 2014, our Texas plan has been in operation since 2011 and has a track record of delivering affordable care and better health outcomes. In a testament of our commitment to servicing these customers, our Texas plan recently was acknowledged by the Medicaid Health Plans of America for our cutting-edge, intensive behavioral health programs. We are well-positioned and have the capital flexibility to pursue these accelerating geographic and market segment expansion opportunities, either organically or through M&A, as Seniors remains a strategic growth priority for us. As a global company, our efforts to leverage these capabilities have also expanded across key markets beyond the United States. In Korea, for example, where the aged population is seeking new solutions to meet their emerging needs, we've developed an innovative and new health membership program targeting seniors known as Heyday. This organically built affinity program delivers value-added services directly to seniors in Korea. And while only a year into this expansion, we now serve more than 300,000 Korean seniors. So overall, we have a clear strategy and the capabilities to deliver value and improve the health and well-being of senior customers today and into the future. Whether in our Seniors business as we discussed today or other growth businesses we have addressed in previous calls, we will continue to deliver attractive growth, produce and deploy capital effectively, and invest and position ourselves to win in new and emerging markets and segments. Now to summarize my comments before Tom offers more detail on our 2014 results and expectations for 2015. Cigna's strong 2014 financial performance extends a multiyear track record of delivering competitively attractive revenue, earnings and free cash flow. Continued execution of our growth strategy is creating value for our customers and clients, complemented by our differentiated capabilities and innovative physician and customer engagement solutions. As a rapidly changing industry and economic environment continues to unfold and new challenges arise, we are positioned to capitalize on new growth opportunities while we continue to leverage our core businesses for growth. And by embracing change, we continue to position our company for successful investing in the future, preparing for significant new opportunities such as those we shared this morning for our Seniors segment, including: in existing programs and markets, new market expansion, new offerings for health care professionals through our medical service organization solutions, new segments such as dual eligibles and new affinity programs such as HeyDay in Korea. We expect to meet our growth objectives of 8% to 10% on average, doubling the size of our company again over the next 7 to 8 years. And based on our focused strategy, strong market positioning and ability to leverage capital, as well as further opportunities we have for growth, we expect to continue to deliver competitively attractive and sustained long-term EPS growth of 10% to 13% on average, all while continuing to invest back in our company. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Thomas A. McCarthy: Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's 2014 results and provide our outlook for 2015. We had another strong year in 2014, with revenue growth of 8% and industry-leading earnings per share growth of 9% over 2013 results. 2014 represents our fifth consecutive year of consistently strong revenue, earnings and EPS growth -- an attractive result both on an absolute and competitive basis. In addition, we continued to generate strong free cash flow in 2014, which resulted in approximately $1.6 billion being returned to shareholders through share repurchase. The strength of our 2014 performance provides us with a solid foundation for growth in 2015. Now moving to operating results. Our full year consolidated revenues grew 8% to $35 billion, driven by growth in each of our business segments and in our targeted markets. Earnings grew 3% to $2 billion, and earnings per share grew 9% to $7.43 in 2014. Our ability to grow revenue, earnings and EPS in a challenging operating environment reflects the strength of our underlying businesses and focused execution. Regarding the segments, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Overall, Global Health Care delivered another good year. 2014 premiums and fees grew 7% to $24.5 billion, reflecting growth in all of our Global Health Care businesses, including ongoing growth in our self-funded programs and specialty products. We ended 2014 with 14.5 million global medical customers, growing by approximately 380,000 customers or 3% for the year. Full year earnings were $1.65 billion, reflecting business growth, specialty contributions, operating expense efficiency and effective medical cost management. Turning to medical costs. We continue to deliver medical costs that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization of care. For our total U.S. commercial book of business, full year medical cost trend was slightly less than the low end of our previous range of 4.5% to 5.5% for 2014. Our commercial medical trend result continues our multiyear track record of industry-leading performance. And given that over 85% of our U.S. Commercial customers are in transfer and ASO funding arrangements, our clients directly benefit from these favorable medical costs. Regarding medical care ratios. In our U.S. Commercial guaranteed cost business, our full year 2014 medical care ratio or MCR was 81.8% on a reported basis or 82.7% excluding prior year reserve development. Consistent with our expectations, our fourth quarter 2014 guaranteed cost MCR of 86.6% reflects an increased seasonal impact from the growing share of high-deductible plans in our employer group and individual businesses. We also expected and saw this increased seasonal impact across most of our Commercial business, including our stop loss and experience-rated businesses. Overall, our employer risk businesses continued to deliver solid results in the quarter and throughout the year, reflecting strong pricing, disciplined underwriting and continued effective medical management and physician engagement. Results in our individual business, while still below long-term expectations, continued to improve in the fourth quarter. In our Government business, our full year 2014 MCR for Medicare Advantage was 83.5% on a reported basis or 84% excluding prior year reserve development, reflecting the impact of medical cost improvement initiatives implemented during 2014. Moving to operating expenses for 2014. Our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 22%. This includes the impact of health reform-related taxes, which added 110 basis points to the expense ratio for the year. Overall, we've had another strong year in our Global Health Care business. Now I'll discuss the results of our Global Supplemental Benefits business, which continues to deliver attractive growth and profitability. Premiums and fees grew 14% year-over-year in global supplemental. 2014 earnings in our Global Supplemental Benefits business were $230 million, reflecting attractive operating margins, continued strategic investments to drive future growth and nonrecurring favorable tax items of $21 million after tax recorded in the third quarter. Fourth quarter earnings of $33 million reflect claims seasonality, our funding of long-term strategic investments and the impact from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. For Group Disability and Life, full year results reflect premium and fee increase of 6% over 2013. 2014 earnings in our group business were $317 million and reflect favorable claim experience in our Life business and a lower operating expense ratio. For our Corporate and Other Operations, results totaled to an after-tax loss of $197 million for full year 2014. Overall, our 2014 results reflect revenue earnings growth from each of our business segments and a significant free cash flow as the result of the continued effective execution of our strategy. Turning to our investment portfolio. For 2014, we reported net realized investment gains of $106 million after tax, coupled with a strong net investment income result. The high quality and diversification of our investment portfolio continued to drive our overall investment results. Now I will discuss our outlook for 2015. In 2015, we expect to continue to deliver strong financial performance for our shareholders by leveraging our differentiated capabilities to meet and exceed the expectations of our customers and clients by delivering affordable and personalized solutions, effectively deploying capital and targeting new and emerging opportunities where we will seek to drive additional value for our shareholders. For full year 2015, we expect consolidated revenues to grow in a range of 8% to 10% over 2014, with continued growth across our targeted market segments. We expect full year 2015 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion or $8 to $8.40 per share. As Will noted earlier, our full year 2015 consolidated and business segment adjusted income from operations, as well as earnings per share estimates, now exclude acquisition-related amortization expense. In 2015, the impact of excluding acquisition-related amortization expense is approximately $0.40 per share or $100 million after tax, including $85 million in our Global Health Care business and $15 million in Global Supplemental Benefits. Lastly, consistent with prior practice, our outlook excludes any contribution from additional capital deployment as well as any prior-year claim development, which in 2014 totaled $53 million after tax. Putting our 2015 outlook and our 2014 actual results on a comparable basis, that is adjusting for the reserve development reported in our 2014 results and adjusting to a consistent base with -- basis for reporting deal amortization, our outlook for operating earnings in 2015 reflects 3% to 8% growth over 2014, and our outlook for EPS growth is 5% to 10% before considering the impact of additional capital deployment. I will now discuss the components of our 2015 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $1.73 billion to $1.79 billion. This outlook reflects continued benefits from organic revenue growth, specialty contributions, effective medical cost management and operating expense efficiencies. This also includes our updated view of the annual enrollment period results for both Medicare and the public exchange business. I'll now summarize some of the key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2015, starting with our customer base. Regarding global medical customers, we expect 2015 customer growth of 1% to 3%. This growth is driven by expected ongoing growth in our Commercial employer business led by continued double-digit customer growth in our Select business, as well as mid- to upper single-digit growth in our Medicare Advantage customers, with some expected reduction in our non-ACA-compliant individual customers. Turning to medical costs. Our 2015 outlook assumes some increase in medical utilization versus current levels, and this increase has been reflected in our pricing. For our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we expect full year medical cost trends to be in the range of 5% to 6%. As Will noted earlier, we are changing the basis on which we provide guidance for MCRs to total Commercial and total Government. We believe this basis will provide better insight into our ability to effectively manage medical costs for our Commercial and Seniors customers. For our total Commercial book of business, we expect the 2015 medical care ratio to be in the range of 78% to 79%. This compares to our full year 2014 total Commercial MCR of 78.9% on an operating basis. For our total Government book of business, we expect the 2015 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5%. This compares to our full year 2014 total Government MCR of 84.7% on an operating basis. Regarding operating expenses, our 2015 Global Health Care operating expense ratio is expected to be in the range of 20.5% to 21.5%. Overall, we expect full year 2015 Global Health Care earnings to be approximately $1.73 billion to $1.79 billion. We believe this is a competitively attractive result reflecting our focus on growing segments of the health care market and continued strong execution of our business strategy. Now moving to the other components of our outlook. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth. We expect earnings in the range of $230 million to $250 million. This represents earnings growth of 3% to 12% after adjusting for $21 million of nonrecurring favorable tax items recognized in this segment in 2014. Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we expect full year 2015 earnings in the range of $320 million to $340 million. Regarding our remaining operations, that is Other Operations and Corporate, we expect a loss of $180 million for 2015. So all in, for full year 2015, we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion or $8.00 to $8.40 per share. Our outlook continues to exclude the impact of prior year claim development or any future capital deployment. While we do not anticipate the impact of future capital deployment in our EPS outlook, we do expect the additional free cash flow that we generate will be deployed for the benefit of shareholders either through value-creating acquisitions or share repurchase. Overall, these results represent a competitively attractive outlook and underscore the benefit of our diverse and differentiated portfolio of businesses. I would also note that due to the timing of some strategic investments, as well as the growth of our Medicare Part D business, which traditionally reports low first quarter earnings, we expect our first quarter 2015 earnings will be lower than first quarter of 2014. Now moving to our 2015 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have excellent financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with a strong return on capital in each of our business segments. Our capital deployment strategy and priorities have not changed. These priorities are : providing the capital necessary to support the growth of our ongoing operations; pursuing M&A activity with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow in our targeted areas of focus; and after considering these first 2 items, we'll return capital to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase. Regarding free cash flow. During 2014, we repurchased 18.5 million shares of stock for approximately $1.6 billion, and we ended the year with parent company cash of approximately $400 million. For full year 2015, we expect subsidiary dividends of approximately $1.7 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our business segments. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, including the funding of our recently announced acquisition of QualCare, this outlook implies we would have approximately $1.8 billion available for capital deployment in 2015, including approximately $115 million we deployed to repurchase 1.1 million shares from January 1 through February 4. Our free cash flow outlook reflects the industry-leading margins and returns on capital in our businesses, and a high level of capital efficiency, particularly from our fee-based businesses. This capital efficiency allows us to fund attractive organic growth while continuing to generate significant free cash flow to be deployed for the benefit of shareholders. Now to recap. Our full year 2014 consolidated results reflect the strength of our diversified portfolio of global businesses and a continued track record of effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by strong growth in revenue and earnings, industry-leading medical costs and quality outcomes, and continued strong free cash flow. Based on the strength of these results, we are confident on our ability to achieve our full year 2015 earnings outlook. And with that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Justin Lake with JPMorgan. Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : First question, David, can you walk us through your view of initial 2015 guidance from the lens of a growth perspective versus your typical targets? And maybe talk about some of the key headwinds, tailwinds, investment spending, et cetera that you see in '15. David M. Cordani: Sure, Justin. So first, the headlines. We're pleased with the 8% to 10% revenue outlook and continued growth of our well-positioned businesses; as Tom noted, the 3% to 8% earnings growth on a same-store basis; and the underlying 5% to 10% EPS growth on a same-store basis. And as we've done in the past, we will continue to make ongoing investments in our company while seeking to generate an attractive and competitively differentiated outcomes for our business. Also very importantly, all the numbers I just referenced exclude the impact of the $1.8 billion of deployable capital we'll have for 2015. As it relates to tailwinds, you can think about several tailwinds for us : clearly, the revenue and customer base growth, number one; two, expense leverage -- we have a track record of continuing to generate efficiency gains and expense leverage, some of which we redeploy for the benefit of innovation. Third, ongoing specialty penetration. We have a good track record of driving further specialty penetration. And fourth, some improvement in the performance of our individual portfolio of businesses. As it relates to headwinds, you can think about a few : as we've discussed before, the impact of specialty pharma on the overall medical cost trend and specifically, for example, its impact on Seniors portfolio of business; two, as you know, another step-up in the industry tax -- a portion of it, our assumptions are, will not pass through fully in the Medicare arena. And thirdly, for us, given our global nature, some FX impact into 2015. But taken as a whole, we feel good about the 2015 impact that we're able to generate here with growth, earnings and EPS growth; capital positioning; and then finally, Justin, the positioning this gives us for 2016, as we would expect to have further earnings accelerants off of the positioning we've taken relative to our Seniors business in that portfolio. So taken as a whole, we're pleased with the outlook for '15. Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And then David, you mentioned the capital deployment not being in the numbers. Every one of your peers now include share repurchase in their guidance. I'm just curious if you could tell us, give us an update on what -- your strategy around not including any benefit from that $1.8 billion in the guidance going forward. David M. Cordani: Sure, Justin. We've always been quite transparent providing the updates each quarter, so stepping back, our capital deployment priorities are clear and unchanged : serve the existing needs of the corporation and support the underlying growth and investments; two, targeted and strategically attractive M&A three, return to shareholders. And to your point, our track record demonstrates our preferred approach there is relative to share repurchase. And our objective is to provide you the transparency of what the free capital available for deployment and allow you to draw your judgments in terms of how you want to look at that. The headline here is really strong and well-performing balance sheet, really strong and well-positioned operating subsidiaries from an underlying capitalization level that provides the $1.8 billion available for deployment. And I would suggest you look at our track record relative to how effectively and how efficiently we've deployed that and we provide updates each quarter. Operator : The next question is from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Could you talk to the drivers in your outlook for the global supplemental business? It seems like the growth rate, and maybe some of that is the impact of foreign currency, is lower than we might have expected for a typical year. Thomas A. McCarthy: Thanks, Matt. It's Tom. Our Global Supplemental Benefits business has a track record of building strong revenue and earnings growth. And it's focused by leveraging the broad and innovative distribution and strong analytic and customer insight capabilities. We saw that result in '14 and we're really seeing that result in '15 also. There are a few layers to the result in '15, though. Our outlook for 2015 earnings of $230 million to $250 million reflects continued strong operating margins; the continued funding of growth initiatives; and continued currency pressure, as you suggested, of about $10 million to $15 million after tax. So if you adjust for the $21 million onetime tax benefit reported in '14, the deal amortization change and the impact of the currency pressure, the underlying growth for global supp is in the 8% to 18% range. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay, okay, that makes more sense. And I'm sorry, did you give a revenue outlook on global supp for '15? Thomas A. McCarthy: No, we don't intend to provide revenue outlooks by business segment, but we're expecting continued strong revenue growth in global supp. Operator : The next question is from Joshua Raskin with Barclays. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I want to talk a little about the public exchanges and the impact on the Commercial business. I guess, first, if you could help us size what the revenues were in public exchanges this year; and maybe what the impact on the overall Commercial MLR was; and then as a part of that, what assumptions you've made regarding the 3Rs. David M. Cordani: Josh, it's David. I'll give you some context relative to size and scope of that business in terms of revenue. I'll ask Tom to give you a little bit relative to the MCRs as well as the -- our positioning relative to the 3Rs. Consistent with our prior conversations, we've positioned this book of business for 2014 as well as 2015. Our expectations is it will be a small portion of our overall franchise. Think of it, in order of magnitude, as we've talked about before, about 3% of the overall franchise revenue in terms of 2014. And we would expect it to be in the similar range in 2015, with some puts and takes in terms of the runoff of the grandfathered business and some growth on the on exchange business. So I think the headline here that's quite important is a small percentage of the overall portfolio that we've been seeking to manage in the context of the performance of the franchise. Tom, could you put a little more color on the MCR? Thomas A. McCarthy: Sure. So Josh, the MCR dynamics in individual have been improving over the course of the year. So also reflecting, of course, increased seasonality in the fourth quarter. It's just basically been improving from our initial expectations in the year. It's still a little higher than where we'd like to be. That improvement has been driven basically by both a better assessment of the early part of the year claims as they developed a little favorably and a little bit of an improvement in the run rate and, as you kind of suggested, the 3Rs. So just a couple of minutes on the 3Rs. Our year-end accrual for 3Rs now totals about $200 million after tax. The majority of the accrual continues to be related to the reinsurance element of the 3R program, with risk adjusters representing the higher amount of the remaining balance and a smaller amount for risk corridor recoveries. And I'll give you some more specific color on our approach. We have accrued reinsurance at the 80% coinsurance level consistent with the design of the program. We have not accrued any risk adjuster impact for our Texas business due to the current lack of industry data. And we accrued amounts under the risk corridor because we're comfortable with the statutes and administrative guidelines that support that program. So as you know, there's some interplay among each of these program elements, but overall, we're very comfortable with our total accrual. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : So I guess more specifically, think about -- I know it's a small portion, but obviously, the MLR is elevated. I'm just trying to figure out the commercial MLR for 2015 with the understanding that you guys have moved the buckets around a little bit. But I'm assuming there's an assumption of the public exchanges getting a little bit better. You've got the industry tax uptick, which assuming you priced for it, is actually a little bit of a tailwind as well, and the guidance is for, let's call it 40 basis points of improvement at the midpoint. So are there -- I'm just trying to think if there's any other moving parts? My guess is you've got a little bit of a benefit on the hep C and Specialty Pharmacy from the new Gilead relationship announced yesterday. So I'm just -- is there anything underlying? Are you guys just basically assuming apples to apples on your total -- on your sort of commercial book flat type of MLRs with a couple of these moving parts helping you a couple basis points? David M. Cordani: Well, Josh, I think you've got the moving parts pretty well nailed. So again, our MCR outlook for commercial in 2015 is 78% to 79% compared to 78.9% on an operating basis in '14. And it is driven by the items you mentioned. It reflects continued good performance in our employer group business, some benefit from pricing for the incremental industry fee in 2015 and some improvements in individual. And that essentially summarizes the major moving pieces. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And I'm sorry, did you guys quantify the FX headwind in the fourth quarter? David M. Cordani: Well, in the fourth quarter, things have been moving around. I'd say low single-digit million dollars impact. So I didn't before, but that's about the quantity. Operator : The next question is from A.J. Rice with UBS. Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Maybe first, I'll just ask you if you don't mind about the private exchange dynamic. I know that was a hot topic about a year ago. It didn't -- it doesn't seem like we're hearing as much about it. But in your ASO book of business, did you see much attrition? And can you just sort of comment on the state of play from your perspective in private exchanges at this point? David M. Cordani: It's David. Just a little color on our view and our positioning and then our results. First, and most -- we continue to view that the private exchanges may create a sustainable attractive long-term market. As such, we positioned ourself in just about all of the various private exchanges that are in the marketplace today. In addition to that, we have our own proprietary exchange and a dedicated leadership team managing the overall exchange activities. As it relates to outcomes to your point, there had been a lot of conversation in the market as we expected. But consistent with our prior dialogues, we did not expect to see a significant amount of movement in the overall landscape in the marketplace in '14 or '15, and that's what manifested for both the industry as a whole, as well as for ourselves. So specific to Cigna, some movement in both directions, but it all nets out to a de minimis amount of activity. Lastly, as we look to 2016, as I noted, we're well-positioned in the respective exchanges. We'll be actively engaged if -- target clients that, we believe, align very well with our value proposition, present good growth opportunities. But slow activity thus far in line with our expectations. Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And maybe just for the follow-up. You mentioned in the prepared remarks MA is an area you would look to -- for potential capital deployment opportunities, acquisitions. And thinking about that, are you looking -- what would be an attractive opportunity for you? Something that just broadens your geography? Or you're looking for something that you think you can run better than it's currently being run? Maybe add some color on what would be attractive there. David M. Cordani: Sure, AJ. We've been very consistent relative to MA is, over the long term, a very attractive growth opportunity. And our view is that a sustainable MA program has 2 major dimensions; effective consumer engagement and personalization capabilities and then strong clinical partnership and physician engagement capabilities with a value-based reimbursement structure, which is what our model is. As it relates to capital employment, you hit the nail on the head. We see both organic geographic expansion opportunities, as well as inorganic geographic expansion opportunities. So that would be one, targeted geographies that are inorganically attractive. Second would be if you expand a little more broadly relative to Seniors and the broader chronic population, additional capabilities or opportunities to serve the Medicare, Medicaid duals or other parts of the population we think are underserved. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we've seen good success in Texas, emerging success in Illinois, and we're going to seek to grow those programs. So those would be the 2 areas for capital deployment : geographic; as well as what we would call segment expansion. Operator : The next question is from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank. Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : First question, just wondering if you could drill into the Select growth, and it looks like the trajectory's still intact there -- double-digit growth. Can you maybe just talk a bit about how much is being driven by continued market shift downstream into ASO in terms of how much increased ASO market penetration you're seeing as -- and then as compared to some of the market share gains that you may be driving in that segment? David M. Cordani: Sure, Scott. It's David. First, relative to Select. So we define Select as employers with 51 to 250 employees, so that's our Select Segment. To your point, it has been and continues to be a very attractive growth segment for us, continuing to notch double-digit customer base growth for us and something we're quite pleased with. Our approach to this base is somewhat different than the marketplace. So it's to be consultative and work with employers to design the right consumer engagement and benefit designs and network structures, and then offer multiple funding alternatives, one of which is, as you referenced, an ASO proposition that gives them much more transparency and tighter alignment. As you know, the overall employer landscape in the U.S. is not growing, shrinking up market, a little bit of growth down market. So there's little bit of growth. But net-net, we're taking share in this space and we tend to take share in this space from more traditionally designed financing alternatives for healthcare, to more progressively designed health engagement programs, incentive-aligned programs that have a high degree of transparency, and the outlook there is very positive. Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And then, just on the follow-up question. Helpful if you could just walk us through your thoughts on the cost components for cost trend relative to the overall 5% to 6%. And then, just within RX, what type of impact year-over-year you think that the new preferred partnership with Gilead for Harvoni could benefit? Thomas A. McCarthy: Scott, it's Tom. So we're really pleased with our medical trend results. And just to repeat, we improved our outlook for medical cost trends throughout the year. We ended up delivering our cost trend below the 4.5% low end of our improved range and building on the very strong trends results we reported for several years. Our outlook for 2015 of 5% to 6% reflects some uptick in utilization and some increase in pharmacy trend, especially drug costs and, of course, some impacts from the flu. Components are generally in the mid-single-digit range with maybe pharmacy in the double-digit range. David M. Cordani: Scott, [indiscernible] to your question relative to the specialty item. You're correct. We will see some impact -- a positive impact. But per prior discussions, our team has effectively managed the specialty drug component and specifically, the hep C specialty component in 2014. We're pleased with the recent announcement we have with Gilead. And importantly, I would note that both organizations have committed to innovating a performance-based and an outcome-based component to the ongoing activities. So we're pleased with the overall development that transpired, but also the commitment of both organizations to collaborate on an outcome-based program for the benefit of customers as well. Operator : The next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, great. I just wanted to drill into the government MLR a little bit. I guess, when you say operationally that the MLR was like 84.7%, that's x development, right? So you're basically saying MLR should be relatively flat to up in 2015 versus 2014? And I guess, when I think about PDP coming in worse, I thought that you guys probably would have made some progress there next year. And then MA, obviously, you've got a funding gap, but it seemed like there was a lot that you were doing in 2014 to try to offset that. So just trying to understand how you think about the margins. Thomas A. McCarthy: Yes, Kevin. It's Tom. And you've got the dynamics right. Our -- we've got an outlook of 84.5% to 85.5% compared to the 84.7% operating basis result delivered in '14. And as you say, that excludes prior development reported in 2014. And the picture, I think, is generally like this. We're generally expecting stable Medicare MCRs between Medicare Advantage and PDP with some mix impact actually driving the dynamic here as we're growing some of the higher MCR Medicaid business we have as a portion of the portfolio. Again, all in the margin, but that's generally the result. And I think the outlook calls generally for a stable result. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then, I guess when you talk about accelerating the MA -- I'm sorry, the government kind of business in 2016 and beyond, is it accelerated from a revenue perspective off the kind of 6% to 8% that you're looking for this year in a membership basis? Or is it margins? Is it both? How do we think about that? David M. Cordani: Kevin, it's David. Again, I think you had the right lever. So one, we're pleased with the outlook we have for 2015 from a growth standpoint. As Tom noted, generally speaking, stable MCRs. As we look to 2016, we would expect to be able to grow both revenue, as well as margin. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we expect to see further improvement in the Stars Ratings, for example. And the positioning we took in 2015 was to position products in key markets within expectation, and what we saw was a step-up in 2016 Stars. So we will see both revenue contribution going into 2016, as well as margin expansion contribution in 2016, therefore, an earnings accelerant. Operator : The next question is from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : A couple of this and thats. The CRomnibus exempted the expatriate businesses from the health insurance fee. Is there a quantifiable impact there? David M. Cordani: Christine, it's David. First and foremost, there have been a variety of administrative release that took place post the passage of the bill back in 2012 and up to, as you referenced, the CRomnibus because the administration recognized that there was an unintended consequence to that business. We're pleased with the outcome from the CRomnibus, legislatively rectifying that for the benefit of global employers. And I would suggest to you the biggest impact here is taking away the administrative complexity that applying the ACA to the global employers expatriate benefit business would create, that was putting a burden on that business portfolio that we were managing through; that's the biggest benefit. There's a small economic benefit, but that's the -- that's a few of the [ph] byline. The bigger piece is it cleans it up for purposes of global employers not to be exposed to that. Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then, can you talk about why first quarter '15 will be lower than first quarter '14 and give us some kind of order of magnitude on the factors? And then, do you think you need Medicaid in order to serve the duals? Or you're still kind of the view that you've got the portfolio you need for those duals? Thomas A. McCarthy: Christine, it's Tom. First, I'll address the first quarter earning spend. Of course, just to reiterate, we're expecting first quarter 2015 earnings to be lower than the first quarter of 2014. And we attribute it to 2 things : strategic investments; and the growth of our Part D business in the first quarter. On the strategic investment side, I think about additional start-up costs in Medicaid expansions, increased grant spend compared to 2014, and the Part D impact reflects both the first quarter pressure typical in Part D, given the benefit structure -- we all know that Part D first quarter results tend to be low -- and the impacts of the drug transition requirements for new customers. So all in, on a comparable basis, we're expecting first quarter '15 to be lower than first quarter '14. David M. Cordani: Christine, it's David. On your second part -- and pretty efficient working in multiple questions here. At a headline level, as we've discussed before and I noted, duals, ABD, et cetera, in targeted geographies continue to present an attractive opportunity for us because we believe they're underserved as it relates to clinical care coordination. And our clinical programs actually play quite affectively there as noted in our Texas program. We're going to seek to grow those activities organically, and then opportunistically as we noted in our M&A priorities, opportunistically for geographic density. We will also look to dual capabilities from an M&A standpoint. So I would view that as both organic and inorganic opportunities for us. Operator : The next question is from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : So just following up on one of the earlier questions here for PDP specifically, the very last quarter you highlighted some pressures around specialty drugs and a higher brand mix, and maybe just how did that continue to play out or evolve in the fourth quarter? And then, related to that, you saw pretty strong annual enrollment -- growth in the annual enrollment period, again, about 200,000-plus lives. So what are your expectations on those costs continuing into next year? Thomas A. McCarthy: Thanks, Andy. It's Tom. I'll start and then David will address some of the growth issues. So as you pointed out, PDP results do reflect higher drug costs in the fourth quarter and the full year. And that includes some impact from the mix in channel of drug purchases and some impact from specialty drugs, so both. We've taken actions to try and improve results here -- that will improve results here. We made network and formulary adjustments when we merged the HealthSpring and Cigna Part D plans for 2015, so that resulted in a leaner formulary and expanded utilization plan -- management for the merged plans, which we expect will improve cost. As you pointed out, we also expect some favorable impact from our recent agreement with Gilead on hep C drugs. But we have factored some ongoing pressure in Part D into our 2015 outlook. David M. Cordani: Relative to growth, as Tom noted, we merged the HealthSpring and the legacy Cigna programs and sought to take the best of both organizations. For 2015, we -- our growth efforts, we're targeting the chooser population and we saw a very good traction in our sales efforts there. We'd note that our early results through January from a utilization and performance standpoint for the new population are in line with our expectation for that chooser population, meaning the aggregate utilization levels, importantly, the mix of utilization by generic and otherwise. And as Tom noted, we expect, generally speaking, stable MCRs going from 2014 to '15 for this portfolio. And again, it presents an opportunity for further earnings expansion looking into 2016. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : And just maybe a -- changing gears a little bit to follow-up question here. A little bit early, but for the national account selling season, I mean, anything to highlight for us as you start really heading into it? Have you -- how much business do you guys have up for renewal to maybe versus an average year? And any opportunities out there that you guys are really looking to target? David M. Cordani: Sure, Andy. As you noted, it's early in the cycle. But to give you some color -- and again, when I give you color, just -- we'll define what we talk about in national account, so commercial employers with 5,000 or more employees that are multistate. We're actually seeing a pretty robust pipeline of new opportunities unfold. So it's unfolding both meaningful scale and early in the cycle. So we're seeing a robust pipeline begin to unfold early in the cycle. And with an elevation -- a further elevation in intensity looking for what we call engagement and incentive-based programs, exploring a lot of the value-based network configurations and the like, which play very well to our strategy. As it relates to the last part of your question, the percent of our book that's out to bid, we see a smaller percentage of our book that's out to bid for 2016 than we did prior year, and that's consistent with the dialogue we had last year. We indicated that we had an elevated percentage based on procurement cycle. So we managed through that queue pretty well for 2015. And now looking to 2016, while the smaller percentage of our book of business out to bid and, again, we're seeing a pretty nice robust pipeline beginning to unfold early in the cycle. Operator : The next question is from Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Can you give us a little more sense of expectations for ASO membership growth versus maybe risk for 2015? And you guys have talked a lot about the Select Segment, but just interested in thoughts maybe more broadly as well since there seems to be more movement within the ASO segment amongst peers. David M. Cordani: Sure, Ralph. It's David. As you know, the vast majority of our commercial business, U.S. commercial business, is ASO. So as we're able to grow our portfolio, the preponderance of that is ASO-oriented. I'd also note that our expectation, as the results unfold and in line with the guidance that Tom provided, the 1% to 3% customer growth, which excludes our QualCare network acquisition, we would expect that our guaranteed cost lives, or our risk lives, would decrease because of the run off of the individual non-ACA compliant lives, so very important. As we get into the year, we'll provide you more detail as that manifests itself. But net-net, you should think about our growth as being predominantly ASO-oriented, and that transcends through Select, the regional segment, et cetera. And we see good traction there. Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And then, just in terms of just the competitive environment for ASO broadly? David M. Cordani: Well, the competitive environment -- maybe I'll flip it around a little bit the other way, and then try to answer your competitive environment. The buying environment, so the client portfolio -- and we call them clear as [ph] clients, clients continue to seek what we call -- you might call alternative funding, we'll call transparent funding -- so the demand for more transparent funding continues to grow as employers are seeking to get alignment of incentives and better visibility through how their funds are being deployed and align the incentives for their employees or customers. And so that trend continues. So hence, the competitive environment, competitors are seeing more ASO activity as well. For Cigna, that's good for us because we're extremely well-positioned in that environment from benefit design, the consultative nature, and very importantly, the employer reporting and insights that go along with that monthly, quarterly and annually to provide the guidance in terms of what's transpiring. So yes, elevation, but it's elevation because of the client demand, not competitive activity. And client demand continues to go up. Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay, that's fair. And then, second question, can you talk about the accretion you've captured from the Catamaran deal in 2014? And maybe what you expect incremental for 2015? And then, your Specialty is separate from that deal. Is there any timeline or decision on whether you want to keep it that way or if you're exploring options at this point? David M. Cordani: Ralph, I'll try to be responsive. Again, real efficient in getting a bunch of questions in here. For pharmacy, more broadly, as you know, we have a wholly-owned pharmacy organization that we continue to invest in. It's performing well as evidenced by our strong clinical outcomes, continued customer growth and strong earnings performance. And we continue to invest in that. So relative to your latter question on Specialty, we run our own Specialty operations within the organization. It's performing well. Our team continues to look to means to further expand and strengthen that, either through collaboration or otherwise. But we're investing in and continue to run that on our own. As for results, and per prior conversations, for 2014, our results tracked in line with our expectations. In fact, they tracked a little bit ahead of our expectations largely because of actions we took around rate and pace of investments, the timing of that and inherent level. So we actually were a little bit ahead of our track record for 2014. And for 2015, our overall targets for our pharmacy business are in line with our expectations, maybe slightly favorable for the overall franchise. Operator : The next question is from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : I just wanted to follow-up on the Select and the ASO mix shift that moved from a stop loss perspective. So I'm trying to understand firstly whether the company that just do stop loss are competing on a bundled or an unbundled basis with all of you? And it looks like United and Aetna have started to play a bigger role here. David M. Cordani: Ana, it's David. First and foremost, as we've talked now for multiple years around the Select space and ASO, ASO stop loss, variety of funding mechanisms, we believed, and it's proven out, we believe that there will be increasing demand. We believe that's a result of the increasing competitive activity, and we believe to be successful we'd have to continue to innovate. And that's what's transpiring in the marketplace. As it relates to standalone, if you'll -- stop loss players in the space, I don't see that as a primary competitive disruptor largely because of the impact of integration here. So if you step back, what makes these programs work is not a stop loss program. What makes these programs work is getting the benefit alignment laid out with the right incentives, the network configuration appropriate, the clinical programs aligned. For example, we have the ability, and we do, do on-site biometric screening, on-site coaching for a 100 lives employer. That's a new model, to be able to do that and bring that on board for a client and identify the 1, 2 or 3 high-risk individuals who are not incurring costs today, but we need to engage clinically with. And integrating all of that with the ASO funding mechanism, stop loss when it makes sense for that employer, as well as the reporting, that's the core of our value proposition and we continue to see strong demand for that today and into the future. And we would expect, again, competitors to step into this space because there's a significant amount of demand. Key to us is the results we're delivering and ongoing innovation. Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : And does that mean then, David, that because of your integration, you can keep your pricing more steady? And the 65-ish percent loss ratios that you used to disclose anyway a while ago, still hold? Thomas A. McCarthy: Ana, it's Tom. I would think about the standalone stop loss segment as a totally different market than the market we're serving. Again, our approach focuses on the integrated benefits of actually more effectively managing medical cost. And the standalone stop loss carriers, you typically don't have that feature. In addition, we do have some built-in advantages versus them. I mean, we already have this customer in our sights, so we have one set of acquisition costs that they have to pay -- incremental acquisition cost to secure this customer, and we have a lot better insight into the underlying claims data, so our ability to effectively approach the program is very superior. So we don't really find ourselves in what sometimes can be a hypercompetitive standalone stop loss market, not really a market we're computing in. We don't sell stop loss unless we write the underlying program. And when we're selling stop loss, it's part of an integrated package. So the competitive dynamics for the standalone market are very different than the competitive dynamics we see. Operator : The next question is from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : My question is also on the stop loss business. Is that business included in the commercial MLR that you're giving us now, in the total commercial MLR? David M. Cordani: Yes. Total commercial MLR will include all of our risk businesses in commercial. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : So just by the growing mix of that in your commercial MLR, it should be pulling the loss ratio down by maybe 100 basis points? Is that a fair number? So does that mean that -- or is it rising in loss ratio on that book of business, so that it's not pulling it down as much going forward? David M. Cordani: Yes, Peter. I have to tell you, I haven't done that calculation. But obviously, we're not seeing it in the results, so I don't -- I think you might be missing a little -- something there. But just a couple of things. First, the loss ratio on stop loss is lower than the average overall loss ratio, but the premium density in the other businesses is pretty high. So I'd be surprised if there was a 1 point impact, but we'll do that math. Second, on stop loss, we actually would expect some modest increase in the stop loss loss ratio as we continue to sell disproportionately in the lower end. And those customers tend to have a more premium density, so less of an expense factor in the result and a higher MCR. Again, very attractive MCR, so it's not like it's worse profitability. The bottom line margin is still very attractive for the -- that stop loss business. But the dynamics in the MLR are a little higher. So I would expect that there's marginal impact probably from this change, but I'll do a little more careful look at that. Operator : The next question is from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Just wanted to come back to capital deployment again. And I heard your comments on Medicare Advantage and things generally. But when we think about opportunities sort of broadly here, are you -- do you think opportunities are better at this point domestically? Or you still think international is kind of a better opportunity? David M. Cordani: Chris, it's David. As it relates to inorganic capital deployment, we have 4 priorities and the 4 priorities have remained the same. These are not in order. These are the 4 priorities : further our global footprint, Medicare Advantage and dual capabilities, further our retail-based capabilities, and then what we call Go Deep bolt-on capabilities for our portfolio. So I wouldn't separate international as more than or less than for 2015 versus the last year. It's within our portfolio when we've been opportunistic and focused in terms of opportunities outside the U.S, as well as inside the U.S. Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Okay. And then, my follow-up is just on sort of overall growth to the company, and specifically in the health care segment. I mean, I'm just trying to figure out, you're growing your revenues 8% to 10%. Obviously, the bottom line isn't growing in line with that. Obviously, PPD is having an impact. But do you -- can you give us a sense for when you think you'll at least start to get some more leverage down the P&L? Is it -- is 2015 sort of the last truly difficult year and we should start to see some leverage next year? I know you're not going to give guidance. But just, again, big picture-wise, just trying to figure out the trajectory of growth. David M. Cordani: Well, the direct answer to your question and then a little more color is yes. A little more color is as we talked about the 2015 outlook, we're pleased with it, with the 8% to 10% revenue growth outlook. And then, the 3-day percent earnings growth outlook on the same-store basis and the 5% to 10% EPS growth outlook without capital deployment. As we said, looking to 2016, we see margin expansion opportunities within the health care business. Margin expansion opportunities, specifically in the senior space, both for MA, as well as PDP. We see further margin expansion opportunities within our individual block of business where we've seen some improvement move from '14 to '15. And then, we'll see further scale leverage beyond the ongoing fundamentals of our strong performing employer business. So margin expansion opportunities exist in 2016 and '17 and beyond, and we're quite excited about that. Operator : The next question is from Brian Wright with Sterne Agee. Brian M. Wright - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : And I apologize if I missed this, but did you give us some color on the number of PDP lives to be added in '15? David M. Cordani: We didn't, Brian. It's about -- we ended up 1 :1 enrollment period. It's about 250,000 more lives than we had at the end of the year. Brian M. Wright - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then, just one follow-up. First of all, thanks for the consolidated commercial MLR. We've been waiting for a decade, so thrilled to have that. But the conspiracy theorist in me looks at how you're reporting now, and you have another peer's been very vocal about kind of large-scale acquisition in this space, and you're kind of reporting segments very nicely that would make consolidating 2 models pretty easily. So just any comments on that. David M. Cordani: Brian, I think you may be able to work for the NSA if you're going try to connect those dots. But the -- really, what you have is continued refinement and responsiveness. We actually chose to provide 2 MCRs versus 1 because there are different attributes within the government portfolio business versus the commercial business. And while we had alternatives, we believe that, that was more customer-friendly and provided the transparency to drive the dialogue on a go-forward basis. And as we have in the past, and as we will on a go forward basis, we'll try to give you as much color as possible in terms of the underlying drivers of the overall business portfolio. But this was an attempt to be, again, responsive to the market, but also maintaining appropriate amount of transparency and not go to a single loss ratio, but provide 2 loss ratios for the domestic health business. Operator : The next question is from the Dave Windley with Jefferies. David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : My question's on Medicare Advantage. David, wondering if through the AAP here and your changes in the mid-Atlantic market, specifically if your view is that those changes -- network, and to the extent they were benefit design as well, are complete and set you up for a more normal contribution from that market in 2016? David M. Cordani: In your comments, Dave, were pointed toward 2016, so put MA back in context. We're pleased in aggregate with the M&A -- MA outlook for 2015 from a customer growth, the 6% to 8% customer growth. You're correct. You draw attention back to a market that we sought to do some repositioning in, and we're feeling the final impact of that, or a final meaningful impact to that repositioning in 2015 in terms of both the lack of life growth. So even in the 6% to 8%, the lack of life growth in that market is fully contemplated in the 6% to 8%. And we would expect, as we step into 2016, an opportunity to see improvement in performance there. So that's a contributor as we look to the future, but part of that repositioning is being felt in 2015. David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : And then, sticking with that, is that also something that you think can have another positive impact to Stars Ratings when they come out later this year? David M. Cordani: Our organization has demonstrated significant improvement in Stars as I noted going from 40 to 60 for 2016. We were pleased with that outcome. It was in line with our expectations. And as I noted previously, we would expect to see a further improvement going from '16 to '17. I'm not going to comment on individual market activities. But more importantly, our organization is highly focused on the intricacies of the Stars program. And importantly, making sure we're given the right service experience and clinical experience, both medical and pharmacy, for the benefit of our customers, and doing so in a way to move the Stars Rating up in 2017 to another step function off of the very attractive movement we made going to '16. Operator : Our last question is from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : David, I was wondering if you could give us some color on how you're positioning your proprietary exchange offering. I know at this point, private exchanges has been pretty de minimis to the business. But just curious, is really differentiation around enhanced engagement and strengthened guarantees, as well as some ben admin element that increases stickiness? David M. Cordani: Michael, so relative to our proprietary exchange capabilities, as you would expect, those capabilities are largely focused on what we'll call down market, so think about Select Segment and a portion of the regional employer portfolio. It's a single carrier, as you would expect, exchange alternative. The value prop -- so let's go into the value prop. The value prop is primarily to enable a further retail experience for individuals to get them more actively engaged in the selection of their personal benefits. And we know that when that transpires, whether through a private exchange or other mechanisms because we do this every day without private exchanges, you get a higher level of awareness, a higher level of engagement, a higher level of ownership of the individual and their benefits and their understanding of what's there, That's the primary mechanism. And then you're able to drive the appropriate personalization or efficiency that works for them. So using your term, consumer engagement or personalization, there's a primary attribute there. As I noted previously though, we've expected this marketplace more broadly to unfold slowly and it is. Our team has seen some success. And we have a dedicated team of resources that will continue to focus on this, but we have not banked on, nor are we banking on a significant step function in revenue, customer lives or earnings growth here. Rather, we've positioned ourselves to have smart optionality to the extent this market moves forward very positively. Operator : I'll now turn the call over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David M. Cordani: Thank you. So to conclude, I just want to offer some points from our morning discussion. Cigna's strong fourth quarter and full year results reflect solid revenue and earnings contributions from each of our business segments. As an organization, we have over 35,000 talented colleagues around the globe whose work exemplifies our mission of improving health, well-being and sense of security for the people we serve every day. The momentum we generated off of another strong year in 2014, combined with our attractive growth opportunities, give us confidence we will achieve our full year 2015 outlook. We plan to continue to leverage our proven business and core capabilities to drive meaningful growth in attractive new markets and segments, resulting in doubling of our revenue over the next 7 to 8 years. And we remain committed to achieving, on average, our annual EPS growth objective of 10% to 13% over the long term. We thank you for joining the call today and your continued interest in Cigna, and we look forward to continuing our conversations.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the question-and-answer session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell. William McDowell : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks, today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's first quarter 2015 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2015. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled \"adjusted income from operations\" and \"earnings per share\" on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2015 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. As a reminder, beginning in 2015, we have simplified our guidance and disclosures for our Medical Care Ratios or MCRs by reporting them on a basis of total Commercial and total Government. The total Commercial ratio encompasses all of our commercial risk products, including medical, pharmacy, dental, stop loss and behavioral products, provided through guaranteed cost or experience-rated funding arrangements in both the United States and internationally. The total Government ratio includes our Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D and Medicaid businesses. Finally, consistent with past practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or additional prior year development of medical costs. And with that, I will turn the call over to David. David M. Cordani: Thanks, Will. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. To begin, I'd like to read the highlights of our financial results for the first quarter. Next, I'll discuss how we are leveraging Cigna's integrated capabilities to engage individuals to help them optimize their health and well-being, and how this is translating into value for customers and clients. Then Tom will provide more detail around our first quarter financial performance and update our full year 2015 outlook. And following your questions, I'll leave you with a few closing remarks. Let's dive in with some highlights from the quarter. Cigna's first quarter 2015 performance represents a strong start to the year. We are pleased with our results, which extends our track record of attractive financial performance. Once again, our success was driven by the effective and disciplined execution of our strategy, which continuously guide our actions in a dynamic marketplace. Our first quarter 2015 consolidated revenue increased 11% to $9.5 billion, with strong contributions across our business segments. We reported adjusted income from operations for the first quarter of $513 million or $1.96 per share. Our Global Health Care revenues increased 12%, driven by strong performance in our Commercial and Government businesses. Our Global Supplemental Benefits business, once again drove strong revenue growth in high single-digit after-tax margins, while we continue to make targeted investments in support of future growth, and we achieved 6% revenue growth in our Group Disability and Life business. Overall, our diversified portfolio of businesses continues to produce significant free cash flow that further enables our financial flexibility with more than $500 million deployed for share repurchase on a year-to-date basis. Our continued focus and effective strategic execution are generating strong results, enabling ongoing investments in our business portfolio and helping us meet the unique local market needs through the right balance of affordability and personalization of our products and services. As we've discussed previously, we have a clear framework to drive ongoing future value creation for Cigna. First, our diversified businesses are well positioned to create attractive value for our customers and clients and, as a result, differentiated revenue growth. Second, we are focused on targeted and effective capital deployment to create ongoing shareholder value through investments in our business, strategic M&A and share repurchase. Our businesses generate high levels of free cash flow, which give us financial flexibility and the opportunity to deploy capital to further create value for the benefit of shareholders. And finally, we continue to seek new and emerging opportunities to expand in new distribution marketplaces, new geographies and new buying segments. Guided by this framework and coupled with effective execution, we continue to expect to deliver average annual revenue growth rate of 8% to 10% over the long term. This framework also positions us to support our focus on enabling health care over financing sick care, which is well aligned with Cigna's efforts to improve the current health care system. The United States spends $3 trillion a year on health care. Studies consistently show approximately 25% of the total expenditures are wasted through inefficiency or breakage. At the same time, 50% of all adults have at least one chronic disease, conditions which translate to 7 out of the top 10 causes of death in the U.S. In this dynamic environment, Cigna continues to convene key stakeholders to work toward a sustainable health care system. Health care stakeholders from individuals to corporate employers and government organizations are seeking a common set of core goals. These include maintaining or improving health and productivity, affordable and predictable cost outcomes and greater personalization of solutions and services. To meet these goals, we must continue to accelerate the transition from yesterday's view health insurance as a mechanism for financing the cost of illness to an orientation center around maintaining and improving the health and wellness of individuals. At Cigna, we are and we'll continue to make significant strides toward achieving a more sustainable health care system, by engaging with individuals and physicians through coordinated offerings and alliance incentives. We have moved beyond the typical multi-product sales and services approach to engaging individuals and coordinate care at a very personal level, as we work to improve health and wellness, all by harnessing information, incenting and supporting individuals and partnering with physicians, the result of which is a service experience for customers that achieves the right balance of personalization and affordability. I'd like to share with you a few examples of how we are leveraging the power of integration and coordination, with our broad solution suite, by encouraging maintenance and prevention among the healthy, providing coaching to the healthy at risk, enabling coordinated care for those with chronic conditions and facilitating access to centers of excellence for those with acute conditions. Our health care professionals engage with customers and clinicians to improve health every day, leveraging the breadth of our clinical capabilities, which spans over 4,000 professionals from doctors and nurses to behavioral health professionals, health coaches and pharmacists. Relative to our behavioral professionals, our capabilities include engaging with a cardiology team when a health event transpires, as we have seen a strong correlation between these types of illness and depression; engaging with our experts in disability programs to improve health and maximize personal productivity; and helping individuals recover from an injury by taking a more holistic view of mind and body. As for result, our customers are empowered by active coordinated care through coaching, support services and incentive programs. And the impact, Cigna clients with integrated offerings have 29% fewer mental health and substance abuse related outpatient visits and 8% fewer inpatient events compared with those without integrated offerings. Another powerful example of our success, with our coordinated approach, is for customers who are expectant moms. In today's health care system, the cost of a premature birth is nearly 11x higher than that of a full-term birth, not to mention the impact on the family stress and, in some cases, lifelong health challenges. CIGNA's Healthy Pregnancies, Healthy Babies program engaged with customers to optimize health during pregnancy, by working with nurses who can assess risks; develop personalized care plans; and continue supportive outreach and coordination with OB/GYN teams; and finally, providing coaching on newborn care. Active participation by expected mothers in our integrated program is key. In fact, for those who enroll, there is nearly 50% reduction in premature births versus the U.S. average. This is a huge impact for the family, the child and society overall. The benefit of integrated and coordinated care is also impactful within Cigna's Specialty Pharmacy programs, where our pharmacists and clinicians engage with customers and health care professionals to improve the effectiveness of drug regimes to drive better overall health outcomes. Our engaged customers have higher medication adherence and lower specialty drug costs, resulting in a 15% lower overall medical cost versus individuals who do not have these coordinated offerings. Our coordination also works with dental care customers, where there's a high correlation between periodontal health and improved health outcomes. In our dental programs, individuals with diabetes, heart disease or stroke, who have both medical and dental coverage with Cigna have seen higher health quality and lower medical costs. For example, patients with diabetes participating in our coordinated and dental programs saw lower average annual medical costs of approximately 28%, when receiving coordinated care. And for patients with heart disease, costs were low by approximately 25%. As a final example across the U.S., our 4,000 plus clinical professionals continue to engage and help our customers in increasing numbers through a rapidly growing collaborative care relationships. Today, we have more than 120 of these relationships spanning 29 states. As for impact, more than 90% of Cigna's collaborative care relationships with at least 2 years of experience are seeing success in managing improved medical costs and nearly 80% with at least 1-year of experience are seeing success in total medical cost results or clinical quality measures. Examples of medical results include an improvement in blood pressure, an improvement in BMI and an improvement in total cholesterol levels. These examples reinforce our successful efforts to improve health and quality-of-life while working to remove cost from the system. By leveraging our integrated capabilities and coordinating clinical care resources for each individual through their health journey, we are improving affordability while creating a more sustainable health care system. Over the long term, we believe our approach to health care rather than sick care will promote better health, sustainability and economic vibrancy and lower the cost burden on customers as well as employers. And this success translates to shareholder value as we leverage our capabilities and meet customer needs with products and services that are enhanced through our highly aligned coordinated offerings. This value is evidenced by our industry-leading medical cost trend over the last several years, high customer retention levels and strong growth in our specialty and integrated services that achieve the personalization of services outcomes that I previously referenced. As demonstrated by our discussion this morning, our integration and coordination of care has moved beyond the simple multi-product solution. Today, we are engaging individuals in a very personalized way, leveraging actionable information, partnering with health care professionals and utilizing care resources that both reduce costs and produce superior health outcomes. Now to summarize my remarks before turning it over to Tom. Cigna's strong start to 2015 continues our long-term track record of financial performance in delivering competitively attractive revenue and earnings and gives us confidence in our increased full year 2015 outlook. The strong free cash flow from a high return on capital and high-margin portfolio of businesses provide ongoing financial flexibility in capital management and deployment. We are effectively executing our strategy and creating value for our customers and clients by leveraging integrated capabilities that promote health care rather than sick care and driving improved personalization and affordability for the benefit of the individuals we serve. We remain committed to our long-term objective, which is to double the size of our business over the next 7 to 8 years, yielding an 8% to 10% annual revenue growth rate on average. And over this time horizon, we expect to continue to deliver competitively attractive long-term EPS growth of 10% to 13% annually on average, all while we continue to invest in our company's business portfolio. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom. Thomas A. McCarthy: Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's first quarter 2015 results and discuss our outlook for the full year. We've had a good start of the year with strong revenue and earnings contributions across our diversified portfolio of businesses, driven by continued effective execution of our strategy. The highlights in the quarter include consolidated revenue growth of 11% to $9.5 billion; consolidated earnings of $513 million; quarterly earnings per share of $1.96; and continued strong free cash flow with approximately $515 million returned to shareholders through share repurchase on a year-to-date basis. Overall, the strength of our first quarter performance provides us with solid momentum for the year. Regarding the segments, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Global Health Care results were solid in the quarter. First quarter premiums and fees grew 12% to $6.7 billion, driven by customer growth in our Commercial and Government businesses as well as specialty contributions and rate actions. We ended first quarter of 2015 with 14.7 million global medical customers, including approximately 200,000 new customers from our QualCare Alliance Networks acquisition. First quarter earnings were $444 million, reflecting medical and specialty business growth, continued effective medical cost management, improving results in our individual business with some offset from increased spending for strategic investments as well as higher seasonal costs in our growing Medicare Part D business. Turning to medical costs. We continue to deliver medical costs that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization of care. Our commercial medical trend result continues to be among the lowest in the industry. And given that over 85% of our U.S. Commercial customers are in transparent ASO funding arrangements, our clients directly benefit from these favorable medical costs. Regarding medical care ratios, our first quarter 2015 total Commercial Medical Care ratio or MCR was 75.2% on a reported basis or 75.9% excluding prior year reserve development. Overall, we are pleased with the results of our commercial risk businesses in the quarter, reflecting strong pricing, disciplined underwriting and continued effective medical management and physician engagement. Results in our individual business continue to improve in the first quarter and are in-line with our expectations. In our Government business, our first quarter 2015 total government MCR was 89.4% on a reported basis or 89.9% excluding prior year's reserve development, reflecting continued good performance in our Medicare Advantage business, partially offset by seasonal costs from our growing Medicare Part D business. Across our Commercial and Government risk books of business, our first quarter earnings included favorable prior year reserve development of $25 million after-tax compared to the $30 million after-tax in the first quarter 2014. Moving to operating expenses, for first quarter 2015, our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 21.7%, which reflects an expected increase in spending for strategic investments. Overall, we've had a strong start to 2015 in our Global Health Care business. Now I will discuss the results of our Global Supplemental Benefits business, which continues to deliver attractive growth and profitability. Premiums and fees grew 8% quarter-over-quarter in global supplemental or 12% on a currency-adjusted basis. First quarter earnings grew 21% or 25% on a currency-adjusted basis to $69 million, reflecting business growth and strong operating expense management as well as some favorable operating expense timing. For Group Disability and Life, first quarter premium and fees increased 7% over first quarter 2014, reflecting growth across the Disability Life and Accident product lines. First quarter earnings in our group business were $51 million, which include unfavorable claims experienced in our life insurance business as well as an expected increase in operating expenses. For our Corporate and Other operations, results totaled to an after-tax loss of $51 million in the first quarter of 2015. Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, our first quarter results reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from our ongoing businesses and significant free cash flow. Turning to our investment portfolio. In the first quarter, we recognized net realized investment gains of $48 million after-tax, coupled with a strong net investment income result. The high quality and diversification of our investment portfolio continue to drive our overall investment results. Now I will discuss our outlook for 2015. In 2015, we expect to continue to deliver strong financial performance for our shareholders by leveraging our differentiated capabilities to deliver affordable and personalized solutions, effectively deploying capital and targeting new and emerging opportunities where we will seek to drive additional value for shareholders. We continue to expect consolidated revenues to grow in the range of 8% to 10% over 2014. Our outlook for full year 2015 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $2.12 billion to $2.21 billion or $8.15 to $8.50 per share. This represents an increase of $0.10 to $0.15 per share over our previous expectations. I will now discuss the components of our 2015 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion, an increase over our prior expectations. I'll now summarize some of the key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2015, starting with our customer base. Regarding global medical customers, we now expect 2015 customer growth of 2% to 4%. This increase over previous expectations primarily reflects customers added through the acquisition of QualCare Alliance Networks, which was completed in the first quarter of 2015. Turning to medical costs. In our 2015 -- our 2015 outlook continues to assume some increase in medical utilization versus current levels which has been reflected in our pricing. For our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we continue to expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 5% to 6%. Now turning to our medical care ratio outlook. For our total commercial book of business, we continue to expect the 2015 medical care ratio to be in the range of 78% to 79%. For our total government book of business, we continue to expect the 2015 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5%. Regarding operating expenses, we continue to expect our 2015 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 21% to 22%. Overall, we expect full year 2015 Global Health Care earnings to be approximately $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion. The other components of our outlook are unchanged. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth in earnings in the range of $230 million to $250 million. Regarding our Group Disability and Life business, we continue to expect full year 2015 earnings in the range of $320 million to $340 million. Regarding our remaining operations, that is other operations and corporate, we expect a loss of $180 million for 2015. So all-in, for full year 2015, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.12 billion to $2.21 billion or $8.15 to $8.50 per share. This represents an increase of $0.10 to $0.15 per share. I would remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior year reserve development or any future capital deployment. While we do not anticipate the impact of future capital deployment in our EPS outlook, we continue to expect the additional free cash flow that we generate will be deployed for the benefit of our shareholders either through value-creating acquisitions or share repurchase. Now moving to our 2015 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have excellent financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with a strong return on capital in each of our business segments. Our capital deployment strategy and priorities have not changed. These priorities are : providing the capital necessary to support the growth of our ongoing operations; pursuing M&A activity with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow in our target areas of focus; and after considering these first 2 items, we'd return capital to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase. Regarding free cash flow, we ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $1.3 billion, which includes approximately $900 million of proceeds from our recent issuance of long-term debt. These proceeds were subsequently used to redeem existing debt in the second quarter of 2015. During the period February 5 through April 29, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of stock for approximately $400 million, bringing our year-to-date share repurchase to 4.3 million shares for approximately $515 million. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we now expect to have approximately $1.3 billion available for capital deployment during the balance of the year. Our free cash flow outlook continues to reflect the industry-leading margins and returns on capital in our businesses and a high level of capital efficiency, particularly from our fee-based businesses. This capital efficiency allows us to fund attractive organic growth while continuing to generate significant free cash flow to be deployed for the benefit of shareholders. Now to recap. Our first quarter 2015 consolidated results reflect the strength of our diversified portfolio of global businesses and continued effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by our first quarter results, which reflected strong revenue and earnings contributions across our diversified portfolio of businesses, industry-leading medical cost trends and high clinical quality and continued strong free cash flow. Based on the strength of these results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year 2015 earnings outlook. And with that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank. Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I was hoping we could just drill into the Government MLR for a little bit and maybe just talk about first just on Medicare Advantage, how utilization trends looked in the quarter, and if you've seen any type of recent indications of any type of inpatient admission acceleration in recent weeks. And then second, just relative to the PDP MLR, just how that tracked relative to your expectations in the quarter. And clearly, given when there's outsized growth in PDP membership there's sometimes risk of higher MLR, so just interested in terms of what you're seeing around script trends and just around general performance in the PDP business so far this year. Thomas A. McCarthy: Scott, it's Tom. So first, we're very happy with the position of our Government business. Our outlook for the Government MCR in 2015 reflects strong results in our Medicare Advantage business and some expected pressure in Part D, as you mentioned. The quarter-over-quarter increase, specifically in the Government MCR, is mainly due to Part D with continuing good Medicare Advantage results. As you pointed out, we reported significant growth in Part D customers in 2015. And as a result, we've had a more pronounced seasonal impact from Part D this quarter. These new customers have a period of time to transition from their previous formulary to our formulary. So as we expected, we saw some additional first quarter cost impacts. And all-in, we continue to expect our government MCR to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5% for the full year, which we're happy with. As far as the outlook or the utilization outlook, we really didn't see any significant change in MA utilization in the quarter. Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay, and then just a quick follow-up. Just in terms of the cost trends view reiterating that 5% to 6% for the full year. Just interested if you could give us some flavor in terms of just in the first quarter itself and Commercial MLR looked quite favorable again. So just interested, do you have a sense of where you were sitting within that range in the first quarter. Thomas A. McCarthy: Yes, Scott, well, we're really pleased with our medical trend results. And as we mentioned many times, we delivered a cost trend below 4.5% in 2014, building on a very strong track record we've had for several years, with industry-leading results. Our outlook for 2015, medical cost trends, 5% to 6%, does anticipate some uptick in utilization over the course of the year and some expected increase in pharmacy trends due to specialty drug costs. And commenting on the first quarter, we haven't seen the uptick in utilization, but we are seeing some expected pharmacy trend impact. So overall, we're comfortable, we're going to again deliver a competitively attractive medical cost trend in 2015. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Yes, I was hoping that maybe you could address what you're seeing in the marketplace in terms of middle-market employers and the extent to which there's interest in self-funding, if you've seen that accelerating, if you think that's going to continue and maybe on the larger end of that, what -- you're getting a taste of in terms of product preferences for 2016. David M. Cordani: Matthew, it's David. As it relates to -- you used the term middle-market, so we'll talk about the regional segment. We define that as employers with 250 to 5,000 employees as well as large single-state employers. The broad theme, I would tell you, is that the market's appetite and interest in transparent funding and aligned funding, which include ASO, continues to grow. It continues to grow both in the regional segment. That has always been a meaningful portion but not the totality of it, but very importantly, as you move downmarket into the Select Segment as well. So point one is continued high and accelerating interest in transparent funding because it aligns incentives, it provides transparency and enables better functionality of the incentive alignment programs and the engagement programs we like. The second theme we see is continued elevation and engagement in we typically call them carve-in or specialty programs. We look at them more as a coordination of care programs. Many of the examples I cited in our prepared remarks. So those will be the 2 predominant trends we continue to see : elevation in transparent funding and then continued movement in what you might call carve-in, we call them coordination of care programs that are delivering the superior medical costs and quality outcomes that Tom made reference to a few moments ago. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay, great. Just on a separate angle, if you don't mind. Can I just ask if you have any comments about the outlook for your PBM relationship, now that there's a change of control event coming with Catamaran and UNH. David M. Cordani: Sure, Matthew. Just by way of backdrop, important to note that we continue to own and operate a very highly performing PBM for the benefit of our customers and clients, and that high performance is being demonstrated through continued growth in customer lives, strong medical trend in clinical quality performance. As you know, we further strengthened those capabilities about 2 years ago, with our expanded relationship with Catamaran seeking several features to strengthen, and we're seeing the benefit of those. As we've talked about that in the past, while we continue to own and operate our PBM, we maintain significant optionality and flexibility in that structure. And then, while we don't typically comment on details of transactions, we view that the PBM marketplace is and will continue to be very dynamic. As such, we ensure that there is adequate deal protections for us that gives us meaningful flexibility going forward. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Joshua Richard Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Just getting back to the commercial -- I'm sorry the Government MLR. I'm just struggling to understand what caused the 290 basis point impact, like if you hold Medicare Advantage and Medicaid MLRs flat year-over-year, it implies the PDP was up 12 or 13 percentage points. It's just not big enough in terms of the growth there to make the difference. So when you think strong performance on MA, is that mean the MLR was down? Or just trying to understand a little bit more of the granularity there. David M. Cordani: So, Josh, just to answer your last question, the MLR and MA adjusting for reserve development is flattish quarter-over-quarter. And in fact, the impact we're seeing in the Government MCR this quarter is largely due to PDP. And again, we're not going to get into the specifics of the loss ratio, but the PDP MCR is always highest in the first quarter, as you know, because of the benefit design and transition period for new customers. And this quarter, in particular, for us, given we have a significant new customer growth, the seasonality was higher than normal. Joshua Richard Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : But I guess, Tom, I mean PDP was up 11%. The overall Government revenues were up closer to 17% or 18%. So you have to see -- when you say the seasonality, I guess why is that product changing? Or are you just saying that the loss ratio and PDP was higher? Thomas A. McCarthy: Well, both. The loss ratio and PDP was higher, and again, we have a more significant mix of new customers, which is accountable for the loss ratio impact. Most of the impact is from the larger customer base and the transition period for the new customers. And we do expect to see the normal seasonal pattern with improved results over the balance of the year. We also get some lift from our agreement with Gilead. It was effective April 1 in Part D, and we have anticipated some modest cost pressure, as we've mentioned, including last quarter continuing for Part D in our outlook for the full year, but that was as expected and then it's reflected in our outlook. Joshua Richard Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And then just switching topics a little bit, the public exchange accounts, like the individual businesses running a lot better and more in line with your expectations. Any comments on Reliance on the 3Rs, any change in your estimations for the 3Rs? Thomas A. McCarthy: Well, first, a little bit on the performance in the business, and we're still in the very early stages. Results in the quarter did see some improvement both from the repositioning of our medical mix and the improved customer demographics, and we are seeing some targeted medical management actions that have lowered lost cost. So over the long term, we're still optimistic that we will see improved results and this will become an effective market segment. As far as the 3Rs are concerned, our accrual for the 3Rs in the first quarter was about $30 million after-tax. The majority of that relates to reinsurance, and we're continuing to accrue in line with the program parameters, and we didn't really make any material change in accruals for the 3Rs related to 2014 business, and we don't really see any significant adjustment to that until we get the final results from the government mid-year. Operator : The next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So first of all, maybe just to continue on the Medicare Advantage question. Obviously, we got final rates for 2016. Do you have any comments on that and also -- and what that means for you in terms of -- I know there's talk about average update of 1.25%, but each company has their own inputs, if you got a sense of where you guys would fall out on that. David M. Cordani: A.J., good morning, it's David. So as we look to 2016, first, we expect to have a base that'll have approximately 60% of our customers in for STAR+PLUS plans, noting a step-up from the prior year. And we expect to think forward beyond '16 to continue to step that up. As it relates to the rate setting environment, the net effects for our mix of our portfolio is that the vast majority of our plans are going to have about a flattish rate impact from all the moving parts from CMS. With the exception of 2 of our plans that will have a meaningful reduction based on the risk adjustors and the accounting rebates, et cetera. The net result for our portfolio of that is, again, the vast majority of our business markets flattish, 2 with meaningful reductions weighted on an all-in base. It's about a 2% reduction. As we looked at taking it as a whole, considering our very well-positioned portfolio of coverage services and collaboratives, we feel like our businesses are in good position stepping into 2016, as such, we continue to expect to both grow customer base, again, stepping into 2016, as well as being able to expand margins stepping into 2016. Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay, great. And then maybe just a follow-up. I know you recently announced an alliance with SCAN Health Plan in California. I wondered if you might give a chance to comment on what you're hoping to do there, and what that opportunity might represent. David M. Cordani: Sure, A.J. When -- and you used the term alliance, which I appreciate. We have a multiple examples of alliances with, in some cases, traditional competitors, not-for-profit competitors, for profit competitors and the like. This most recent relationship with SCAN aligns our very high-performing employer portfolio of businesses in California with their well-performing Medicare capabilities and enables us to deliver an employer-sponsored Medicare Advantage solution to employers that are on target for them, but we had distribution reach and lever their capabilities. So it's a wonderful example of playing to both organizations strength, enabling us to deliver an expanded set of solutions and capabilities on a more accelerated time frames than we would've been able to do organically and be able to deliver value for our existing clients and expand SCAN's relationship net win for both organizations. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I guess a couple of clarification questions. The commentary about the MA rate for 2016, was that including the Star pickup or before the star pickup? David M. Cordani: It's net of all the moving parts, Kevin. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then on the individual commentary, I guess I don't remember, if you said it specifically or not, but it sounded to me like you're still expecting to lose money in 2015 on the public exchanges? David M. Cordani: Net-net, as we've discussed before, Kevin, we look at '14, '15 and '16 as the version 1.0 of the marketplace. We built that business plans not around achieving the revenue or EPS significant contributions out of this book of business. As you know, we expect it to improve the performance of the block of business going from '14 to '15 that is taking place. So on a fully-allocated basis, there's a loss in the business, but is less than 2014, but we'd expect that to improve further as we step into 2016. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then just -- at the beginning, you talked about some of the medical management capabilities that you guys are bringing. Some of them, like the preterm births, is really something that comes in pretty usefully in the Medicaid side of the business. I wonder if you feel like you guys are better positioned to participate in that side of the business, RFP-wise I have seen a couple of other companies, who haven't historically been in that market get more aggressive. How do you think about RFPs that seem to be coming up over the next couple of years? Thomas A. McCarthy: Relative to the Medicaid space, we've been very consistent that we see opportunity in the higher risk or coordinated care dimensions of the Medicaid space, so we can call that the dual space and the various other high-risk portfolios. We have targeted examples of success to date, most notably in counties within Texas where we just -- we're recognized for an award of coordination of care with our behavioral and clinical capabilities. So we do see [indiscernible], we do see opportunities. It's highly geographically targeted in our Go Deep markets, and it's within those programs that enable significant coordination of care both engaging the individual and working with the clinical professionals. So we see targeted expansion opportunity over the next several years here. Operator : The next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Can you give us a little bit of sense of why you did grow so much in PDP maybe kind of where it came from, if you could, at what percentage maybe was auto assigned and then just give us a sense of where it all kind of shook out relative to your expectation. Thomas A. McCarthy: Ralph, it's David, at a macro level, the majority of our growth was not auto assigned, so the step function to highly targeted geographically, and the significant amount of work was done within the benefit-design configuration to target subsegment of buyers in key geographies. So as Tom noted, meaningful growth, but we expected it. We factored that into our guidance. We talked about it last quarter to acknowledge that there would be -- we recognize there's a transition of care window that largely spans the entire first quarter that transpired, but largely not assigned targeted geographies, targeting by segment and design products with that in mind. Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay, right. That's helpful. And then, can you just update us on where you sit on private exchanges? I know one of your customers recently moved and my understanding is actually that you retained a large percentage of the book. But can you talk about conversations you're having with customers and your opportunities there for sort of the existing as well as new opportunities? David M. Cordani: Sure, relative to the private exchange marketplace, we continue to view this as a potentially attractive long-term market as it unfolds. As such, we've allocated leadership, significant resources to the portfolio of businesses here. We are currently positioned in the vast majority of third-party exchanges that exist in the marketplace up to and including, also having our own captive exchange. To date, the performance is generally speaking in line with our expectations, which we thought was a slower market transition than maybe some had flagged in the grand scheme of things. To date, we've seen some wins and losses in terms of our portfolios we've discussed before. As we stand here today, we have several hundred thousand lives when you span across our core medical and specialty capabilities as well as additional lives in the supplemental space. But it's in the early innings. We're positioned and we're evolving within the marketplace. And as you know, as our existing customers choose to transition, we have a brand positioning and a service proposition that tends to win us a lot of business in the choice marketplace. So performance in line with our expectations thus far. Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : That's helpful. Just real quick and a follow-on to that. Just on the transition, if you have an ASO customer and they move to a private exchange and you retain that customer, ASO to ASO, is the profitability essentially the same? David M. Cordani: It's varied, obviously, depending on the configuration, but you should assume that the way we are seeking to position ourselves on the exchanges is to ensure that our offerings enable us to have enough of the, we'll call it, coordination and specialty reach that I made reference to in my prepared remarks to be able to deliver differentiated value and not move back to I call it TPA administrator. So the simple answer is, it depends, because all the exchanges are not created equal. Our strong operating bias is the integration and coordination because that's where we deliver our step function value. Operator : The next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Thanks for your commentary on the Government segment. Can you give us the same kind of commentary on your Commercial segment? How did you track with respect to stop loss versus experienced rate versus guaranteed cost relative to from a year ago in your expectations? Thomas A. McCarthy: Christine, it's Tom. So overall, the headline in the commercial segment is the commercial MCR is very consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Again, the headline messages the employer group business continues to perform very well, individual business continues to improve. Quarter-over-quarter, in particular, the MCR is about flat. That reflects the improvement in individual with some offset by business mix impacts. But again, within those businesses the MCR is performing as we'd have expected by product line. Then I would point out, we would expect some increase or some improvement from the increased health insurance fee, but I would point out that our mix has that impact smaller than most others. Operator : The next question comes from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : So just first, the National Account selling [ph] can you give us some updates -- on your last call you indicated you had an elevated percentage out for bid this year based on the procurement cycle. So curious how that's progressing. David M. Cordani: Sure, Andy, it's David. First just let me redefine our national health, as we defined it a bit differently than our competition. For us, it's commercial employers with 5,000 and more employees that span multiple states. So we exclude the large single-state commercial employers that's part of our regional segment. You have a good recollection. Year-over-year as we look back to last year, our pipeline was about equal to the prior year, but our -- portion of our book of business that was out to bid was elevated due to procurement cycles. As we look at the current cycle, looking forward to 2016 relative to the pipeline of new opportunities, number of cases is about the same. Average case size is somewhat elevated. So on a life-basis, but more lives to look out but then a similar number of cases. As it relates to the percentage of our book of business out to bid, the percent is back down because that procurement cycle that's moving through. So early in the overall sales cycle, a healthy pipeline of opportunities to look at, a reasonable percentage of our book of business is out to bid. We continue to be focused on retaining the right business and earning the right business that has engagement and incentive alignment, expanding our specialty capabilities as indicative of our continued ability to grow revenue and earnings in the space by delivering value to those clients that are on target for us. Operator : The next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Wanted to follow up on the question on the commercial loss ratio, just as far as, individual off-exchange on-exchange, the guaranteed cost and the stop loss. So I get it that it's in line with expectations. I think there was a lot of pressure on your off-exchange book last year. It seems like you've seemed to have traded with some of the membership is that coming from off exchange. And are you seeing the overall individual book negative but that book of business is kind of returning to profitability at this point? David M. Cordani: So it's David. Let me just frame it a little bit relative to the individual. First, as Tom noted in the employer book, the employer book last year, this year continues to perform well and in line with our expectations. Within the individual book of business, as you very well know relative to us, it's small in the grand scheme of things in terms of covered lives. As it relates to the grandfathered and some of the transitional block, one of the states where we had a large grandfather block of businesses, a state where we don't operate on the exchange, specifically California. So we saw attrition relative to the grandfathered block stepping into 2015, which was in line with our expectations. We still maintain a mix of on-exchange and off-exchange business and that, taken as a whole, the loss ratio of our business, and therefore, the underlying performance of the individual business steps forward and improved in line with our expectations going from '14 to '15. Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : And then on the guaranteed cost legacy book, have you seen margin expansion? Some of your competitors are very commercially focused. There's some really nice margin expansion. I'm just trying to get to the underlying metric here. David M. Cordani: And, Ana, are you referencing individual or group? Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Group, group. David M. Cordani: Within our group block of business, as you know, we don't play in the small group employer. So you need to take the under-50 block and remove that from the way you think about us. Relative to the over-50 block of business, our performance was strong and remained strong in that portfolio of business. Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : And then finally on stop-loss, is that trending flat or are margins coming in or expanding? You've seen a nice 19% growth in premiums there. Thomas A. McCarthy: Ana, it's Tom, margins and stop-loss are just where we'd like them to be. So the result -- the performance in the book is good. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Question on your strategy around M&A going forward. You're a little bit subscale to some of the other national account players, which you -- now you focus on some geographically concentrated markets as a way to compensate for that. But just some books of business likely to come up, one in particular, just the other day is being shopped. It's more of a broad book of individual business and there's some expectation that some of these smaller plans that are focused on certain geographies exchange base business that are going to come up for sale. Do you think some of those books will be interesting to you guys? And if they are, a lot of why they're up for sale would be that they're under pressure. And so the -- some of the business is underpriced. How would you react to fixing books of business that you see up for sale? David M. Cordani: Peter, David. Let me give you a little color on M&A. You factored in many statements and questions there. So first, broadly relative to M&A. M&A continues to be a component of our value creation framework. So it's effective deployment of capital, strategic M&A is a component within there. Our priorities have been consistent in terms of where we see the ability to create step-function value, specifically smartly furthering our global footprint; two, expanding our MA and dual capabilities; three, expanding our retail capabilities; and four local tuck-ins. And we've had a successful track record of accomplishing targeted acquisitions over the last 5-plus years in line with our strategy. As it relates to your scale comment, we've chosen to redefine our orientation around scale to ensure that we have appropriate scale to have competitive cost structure from an administrative cost standpoint, which we have. We've been able to prove productivity gains year-in year-out and free capacity to further ongoing investment back to within the franchise. And then you come down to medical cost to your dialogues, and that's a very localized conversation and it's not a localized conversation at the state level. It's an MSA level, and increasingly, within our marketplaces, it's coming down to a sub-MSA level. So we're highly focused on key geographies and our ability to win and deliver value for our clients and customers. As related to appetite for future M&A, I mean, opportunities where we're very aware, engaged and highly focused. So as long as the transactions are on strategy relative to the items I talked about before. On a final note, I'm not going to speculate on how you would rehabilitate an underperforming book of business, but our organization has demonstrated the ability to deliver high performance within our targeted segments, and again, we see M&A as a forward-looking opportunity to create smart transactions and good shareholder value. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : And then, just it's on the Part D business, one further question. You talked about some of the higher MLR being from transition issues. Is your guidance going forward making the assumption that those transition issues are resolved in Q1? Or do you expect that to continue into Q2? And what if it -- if it isn't transition issues and you're not able to resolve it, will that impact your guidance and by how much? Thomas A. McCarthy: Peter, it's Tom. I think that a little differently. This is the prescribed 90-day period for new members to stay on their old formulary, while they transition to our new formulary. So we would expect that to work itself through during the first quarter. Operator : And the next question comes from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Just wanted to focus on the guidance for a minute, particularly in a Global Health Care segment. You raised by $15 million at the mid-point, but you had $25 million of TPD. I'm just wondering why the raise wasn't at least in line with the level of reserve development. Thomas A. McCarthy: Chris, it's Tom. We're really pleased that we've been able to increase our outlook this early in the year. Again, we expect to deliver attractive growth and revenue earnings and EPS across the company and in Global Health Care in 2015, just as we have in each of the last 5 years. So really I'd see our revised outlook as just reinforcing our confidence that we're on track to deliver those results. Matthew Coffina - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then just with regard to the comments in the press release about the investment spending in the quarter, in the health care segment, was that -- that was expected in the original outlook just to be clear? Thomas A. McCarthy: Yes. Operator : The next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : On the operating expense guidance and ratio, I guess I'm just looking at your starting year toward the higher end of that range. Your trends tended to rise, intra-year, rise through the year in historical years, and you're mentioning some favorable impacts in, I think, disability this quarter -- excuse me, sub this quarter. So I guess, I'm thinking it should rise this year as well unless you tell me otherwise. So how do you see that trending over the balance of the year to hit that range that you provided? David M. Cordani: Dave, it's David. So directionally first off, we knew the first quarter was going to have an elevated level of expenses. As such, on the last quarter when we talked about the first quarter pattern, we flagged that and it was called out, as mentioned, in the further questions as we looked at many of our strategic spend initiatives. Two, as you made reference to our outlook is to see that our operating expense ratio will show a year-over-year improvement as we have been able to demonstrate for many years as we look back and our organization is tightly aligned relative to that. So the performance of that will transpire a little differently into 2015 quarters as opposed to the prior quarters. But Q1 was known as an uptick. Our outlook is to see an improved expense ratio and organization is on track to achieve that. David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : So if I can -- if you can clarify just a little further, would you expect the investments that you flagged in 1Q to then exit or evaporate in 2Q and it's a drop back down significantly and then turn back as it normally does? Or is it just a completely different pattern this year? David M. Cordani: Yes, Dave, I wouldn't expect the strategic spending to decline over the balance of the year. I think what I'd expect to see is both a little different pattern of revenue and earnings to get to the result we've talked about. Operator : The final question comes from Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : One of your peers recently indicated their discussions with employers suggest that there could be a step-up in conversions to private exchanges in the next 1 to 2 years. Are you hearing similar from your clients? And if you could share with us what percentage of your private exchange book is self-funded and what percent are new members to Cigna? David M. Cordani: It's David. First, the dialogue with employers has been active around private exchanges, as it has been around consumer-directed engagement programs, et cetera. I think the broader picture here is that, employers of all sizes are looking for the higher value creation benefit strategies that are going to be sustainable for them. That's the broader dialogue. And private exchanges represent a tool that many employers are trying to explore to determine whether or not it is part of the overall portfolio. What we've seen, and what the market has seen is a relatively modest adoption rate of that toolset, but it's early on, as we've indicated, in the private exchange cycle. Two, what we've seen is a continued elevated performance of self-funded consumer-directed aligned incentive and coordinated integrated offerings. As it relates to our own experience within the private exchanges, to the second part of your question, the vast majority of those employers are in the self-funded space given the profile of what we operate in, but we have guaranteed cost lives there as well. We have integrated and nonintegrated lives, but again it's small in the grand scheme of things in terms of what we're seeing. And a portion of the lives we're seeing there are new to Cigna. Greater than 50% of those are transitioning from existing Cigna relationships carried over to the exchanges. But the important part is that it's still a small part of both the marketplace as well as our portfolio. Two, we've deployed significant resources to make sure we're in position on the various exchanges, including our own captive and proprietary exchange. And three, we seek to be very consultative with our employers to make sure they understand all the choices that are available to them. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : And as employers are evaluating their different options, you mentioned, within the high deductible plans or private exchanges, can you tell whether or not one is emerging as the more likely way that employers are trending, or if there's any difference in how they are trending based on employer size, whether they're not going towards the private exchanges versus high deductibles? David M. Cordani: Well, Sarah, I think we could point to both the track record of actions as well as the emerging actions. So the more tangible track record of actions is that, employers of a variety of sizes continue to move toward the transparent funding, which includes ASO. That's a consistent track. Two, elevation of aligned incentive programs, whether they're consumer-directed, full-on CDHP programs or if they're coinsurance programs, coinsurance programs with aligned incentive models, those would be the 2 most tangible pieces I think you could point to. And then over the last couple of years, an emerging trend too, as I referenced before, carving in or even more adoption of integrated care programs that are coordinated to delivering the value back. But private exchange, if you will, trend again is still in the early stages and I wouldn't flag it as one where we would see the majority of buying behavior over the next 2 buying cycles. But as we're positioned, we're positioned for an elevation and volume should unfold. Operator : I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David M. Cordani: Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the question-and-answer session is being recorded. We will begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell. William McDowell : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna\u2019s second quarter 2016 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2016. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled, adjusted income from operations and earnings per share, on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today\u2019s earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2016 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today\u2019s earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. In the second quarter, we recorded an after-tax charge of $26 million or $0.10 per share for merger-related transaction costs. And we reported this charge as a special item. As described in today\u2019s earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of second quarter 2016 results. Also, consistent with past practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or additional prior year development of medical costs. And with that I will turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks, Will. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. It\u2019s been over a year since we\u2019ve held formal earnings call due to our pending combination and clearly much has happened. We wanted to take the opportunity to connect directly with you, first to reaffirm our goals and how we are delivering on our strategy; second, to provide an update around this quarter\u2019s results and the actions we are taking to remedy this specific performance headwind that has caused us to miss our expectations; and third to provide some perspective regarding the actions from the U.S. Department of Justice to block our proposed combination with Anthem. After I share my remarks, Tom will briefly highlight our second quarter financial results and updated outlook in more detail and we\u2019ll take your questions. After that, I\u2019ll leave you with a few closing thoughts following the Q&A portion of the call. I\u2019d like to begin by underscoring that over the past year our goals had been clear, first and foremost to continue to effectively run and operate our businesses with a focus on our customers and clients and on delivering long-term value for you, our shareholders; second, to support and guide the proposed transaction through the regulatory process, as Anthem leads that process and we support it; and third, to keep the company well positioned with optionality in a variety of scenarios, given the uncertainty around the regulatory approval process. We are delivering our strategy. We have maintained focus, and continue to grow and invest in our businesses, while delivering differentiated value for our customers and clients; and also this quarter, deliver on our shareholder commitments. While our results underperformed expectations in the second quarter, to be clear, our diversified businesses remain grounded in solid fundamentals and we continue to innovate and deliver a notable array of capabilities that are truly differentiated. Our relationships with employers, providers and partners continue to strengthen. We continue to add new customer relationships in addition to maintaining high retention levels for existing customer and clients. We are maintaining a strong pipeline for future growth in all of our businesses and we continue to generate and warehouse historical levels of deployable capital and balance sheet capability. While this is our media backdrop, it is important to remember our long-term strategic goal of 10% to 13% compounded annual growth on average for earnings per share. And over the last six years, we have delivered 13%, which is at the high-end of that range. I\u2019ll now turn to our results in the second quarter. Our Global Healthcare and Global Supplemental Benefits business delivered strong 2016 second quarter financial results for our portfolio, which were tampered by disappointing performance in our Group Disability & Life segment. Our second quarter 2016 consolidated revenue increased 5% to $10 billion over the second quarter of 2015. We reported adjusted income from operations for the second quarter of $515 million or $1.98 per share. Our revenue growth is fully in line with our expectations; however, the earnings were pressured by temporary impacts on our Group Disability & Life segment. Given that as a backdrop, let\u2019s discuss our group operations, specifically performance, issues and actions. The quarterly results were significantly below our expectations in both Disability and Life businesses. The poor performance in Disability is a result of modifications made to the disability claim process, coming into the first quarter this year, where we are investing additional resources in the upfront medical review of claims to conduct further physical examinations, perform deeper medical history reviews and enhanced documentation. These modifications has resulted in longer claim cycles, thereby increasing the disability durations and our claim inventory which has contributed significantly to the unfavorable financial impact we have experienced in the first-half of 2016 for this business. We are currently making the investments necessary to strengthen the operational processes in a manner that will provide an improved customer experience as we lower claim volatility and further improve the quality of decisions, all at a lower operating cost. While we have to realize the long-term benefits associated with these changes, it is important to recognize that they are both customer-friendly and aligned with regulatory best practices. As a result, our disability operating results are expected to improve over the balance of 2016 and into 2017, as these changes take hold. And see this differentiated disability model with unique focus on productivity and health continues to deliver value for our customers and clients as evidenced by our sustained growth and stable performance up to this point. Now, to round out group insurance and add to the disability pressure in the second quarter, our Group Disability and Life earnings were significantly impact by unfavorable life claims. Where claims emerged unfavorably early in the quarter, claims in last month of the quarter were more in line with our expectations. It is important to know for context, we have had periods of life claim volatility in the past and expect life claims to run closer to historic levels over the balance of the year. Do in part as a rapid reversion of the short terms spike-in claims to historic levels. And some reserve strengthening of pricing actions that we are taking. We understand the results in this business did not your expectations and to be clear they did not meet ours. We are taking actions to ensure they will improve and they present in earnings trajectory opportunity for us as we look to the future. Additionally and importantly, our client and customer performance has been strong, despite the financial impact of these challenges in the second quarter. Overall, our Group Disability and Life business remains an important part of our portfolio. As for the rest of our portfolio, we continue to post strength in our employer healthcare book and our Global Supplemental business. While, U.S. individual business has experienced softness similar to the rest of the industry overall our commercial book-to-business is performing well. Additionally, our U.S. Medicare continues to perform in line with our expectation recognizing we did incur increased temporary costs associated with our CMS audit response. Now turning briefly to our pending combination. As you\u2019ve recently seen United States Department of Justice has sued to block the proposed combination with Anthem. Given the nature of the concerns raised by the DOJ in the overall status of the regulatory process, which under the merger agreement is led by Anthem, we step back briefly to evaluate our options, consistent with our obligations under the merger agreement. As part of this evaluation, we obviously sought to deeply understand the various and significant concerns of the DOJ and the states that have joined on, as well as past possibly address their broad and specific concerns. So to be clear, we have and will continue to fulfill our contractual obligations. If there was a successful combination to be completed it is clearly our intent and commitment to continue to provide the support as we have dedicating significant resources, time and effort to do so. If there is not a combination to be completed, we will seek to improve shareholder value by accelerating growth in our core strong performing businesses, improve the results of our underperforming business, seek to pursue additional growth opportunities. And finally seek to further create shareholder value with the tremendous capital flexibility we have created over the last several years. Reflecting on all these challenges and the criticality of the work we do, which impacts more than 90 million customer relationships around the world. I\u2019d also like to take a moment to thank to Cigna team. And recognize their steadfast passion, resilience and focus on our customers and clients during the past year. I have to summarize, Cigna\u2019s performance this quarter includes solid revenue and earnings contributions from our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental benefits business. And performance from our Group Disability and Life segment that did not meet our expectations, we believe these results will improve meaningful over the remaining 2016 and 2017 timeframe. Are highly engaged passionate and extremely resilient team will continue to create value for our customers and clients by leveraging the strength of our diversified businesses and our differentiated capabilities. We remain committed to our long term objective to continue to deliver competitively attractive long term EPS growth of 10% to 13% annually on average, all while continuing to invest in our company\u2019s business portfolio. And with that, I\u2019ll turn to call over to Tom. Thomas McCarthy : Thanks, David, good morning, everyone. And my remarks today, I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna\u2019s second quarter 2016 results and discussed our outlook for the full year. Overall, key highlights in the quarter are consolidated revenue growth of 5% to $10 billion. Consolidated earnings of $515 million, quarterly earnings per share of $1.98 and continued to strong capital efficiency and free cash flow in line with our full year expectation. Regarding the segments, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Second quarter premiums and fees grew to $26.9 billion. Second quarter earnings were $486 million reflecting medical and specialty business growth and continued favorable medical cost and quality outcomes particularly in our commercial employer group business. These drivers were partially offset by higher medical costs in our individual business and increased costs related to our Medicare advantage CMS audit response. Turning to our Global Supplemental Benefits business, on a currency adjusted basis, premiums and fees grew 12% and earnings grew 15% quarter-over-quarter to $83 million. This was another strong quarter for our Global Supplemental Benefits business. Group Disability and Life reported a second quarter loss of $12 million, results in the second quarter reflect continued impact, modification to our disability claims process and poor experience in group life claims. While, second quarter results in our disability business were better than results in the first quarter, the improvement was less than we have expected. Results in the Group Life business were also below expectations. We experienced elevated claims early in the quarter, our life claims were more in line with expectations later in the quarter. This quarter\u2019s results also included $17 million after tax unfavorable impact from reserve study on our life business and for comparative purposes the second quarter of 2015 results included $37 million after tax favorable impact from our reserve study on our Group Disability business, resulting in a $54 million after tax unfavorable variance from reserve studies quarter-over-quarter. Over the balance of the year, we expect life claims experience to run closer to historical levels and we continue to expect disability result to improve, though at a slower pace than previously expected. As the process modifications implemented in the first quarter take time to mature and long term benefits begin to emerge. Overall, our second quarter results reflects solid revenue and earnings contributions from our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits business and continuing pressure in the Global Disability and Life results. We also continue to generate strong free cash flow from our business and had significant financial flexibility. Now, I\u2019ll discuss our outlook for 2016. We continue to expect consolidated revenues to grow in the mid-single-digit range over 2015 results. Our outlook for full year 2016 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $2.02 billion to $2.11 billion, or $7.75 to $8.10 per share. This represents a reduction of $1.23 per share at the midpoint from previous expectations and it\u2019s driven by and approximate $0.30 per share reduction due to higher than previously anticipated costs associated with our CMS audit response and higher medical costs in our individual business. And an approximate $0.90 per share reduction due to higher claim costs in our Group Disability and Life business. Provide greater transparency within our outlook, we are introducing segment level guidance for full year 2016. We expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $1.9 billion to $1.93 billion. The assumptions reflect in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2016 include the following. Regarding, Global Medical Customers, we continue to expect 2016 customer growth in the low-single-digit percentage range. Turning to medical costs, our 2016 outlook continues to assume some increase in medical utilization, which has been reflected in our pricing. For our total U.S. commercial business, we expect full year medical costs trend to be in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%. We continue to deliver medical costs that reflects better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization of care. Now, turning to our medical care ratio outlook, for our Total Commercial book of business, we expect 2016 medical care ratio to be in the range of 78.5% to 79.5%. The MCR that reflects continued to strong performance in our commercial employer business in some continued pressure in individual medical costs. For our Total Government book of business, we expect 2016 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84% to 85% reflecting the continued benefit for physician engagement model within our seniors business. Regarding operating expenses, we expect our 2016 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 21% to 22%, which includes the impact of spending on our CMS audit response. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth on a currency adjusted basis and earnings in the range of $255 million to $275 million. Regarding the Group Disability & Life business, we now expect full year earnings in 2016 in the range of $40 million to $80 million. Group Disability and Life earnings are well below our previous expectations and reflect results to date and continuing pressure over the balance of the year. Regarding our remaining operations, that is Other Operations and Corporate; we expect a loss of $175 million for 2016. So all in portfolio 2016 we now expect consolidated adjusted income for operations of $2.02 billion to $2.11 billion or $7.75 to $8.10 per share. I would also highlight that we expect earnings and EPS between the third and fourth quarter to be more evenly distributed than historical patterns. And I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior year reserve development or any future capital deployment. Regarding free cash flow, year-to-date we have repurchased 785,000 shares of common stock for approximately a $110 million. We ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $2 billion. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we expect to have approximately $2.75 billion and parent cash available during the balance of the year, including $250 million held for liquidity purposes. Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook are strong and remain in line with our expectations. Now, to recap the fundamentals of our Global Healthcare and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses remain strong. We are also taking the appropriate steps to address the challenges we are facing Group Disability & life. We are confident in our ability to achieve our revised full year 2016 earnings outlook. And with that, we\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Matthew Borsch : Thank you. And thank you for your decision to hold the call. I think it makes sense in light of where we are and also the volatility and results. Would you mind just stepping into little more detail on the Group Disability & Life? And help us understand the $0.90 lower outlook. How much of that is Life? And I gather on the Life side, that\u2019s just pure variability. There really isn\u2019t any causation that you can point to there nor any reason why we should expect that to repeat. And on the Disability side, how much of it is because you put in this new systems process that you missed some of the claims expense from earlier periods or maybe I\u2019m misunderstanding what it is? David Cordani : Good morning. It\u2019s David. Let me try to paint the picture on your various questions for both the Disability and Life piece. First, just to frame our group insurance business has been a strong and consistent performer. We recognize we\u2019re having an audit pattern year. We understand that and as I noted in prepared remarks, we are taking specific steps to improve that. Let me talk about Disability first and then Life and I think I\u2019ll put all your questions into that context. From the Disability standpoint, first, we made operating changes to our business processes. Very importantly, these are not systemic changes or changes in technology. These are business process changes starting at the first quarter of this year with a goal of improving our customer service, driving further efficiency and effectiveness over the long-term, all while complying with a merging regulatory best practices. It\u2019s clear that the operational disruption is more significant and prolonged than we have planned for. Importantly, our customers continue to see good strong service. However, as we noted, the financials have suffered. We\u2019re already seeing improvement in the patterns as we go through the second quarter. So we see the pattern improving and expect to continue to see that improve throughout 2016 and as we step into 2017. These are not catch-ups for prior year claims. Don\u2019t think about it that way. It\u2019s operational process changes of meaningful magnitude and we\u2019re already seeing improvements to the pattern and we will see improvements throughout 2016 and into 2017. Relative to the Life book, your basic hypothesis is right, we have a meaningful book that over time has performed very well. Unfortunately, from time to time our Life book of business has a temporary dislocation or spike. And the second quarter of this year was one of those years. Order of magnitude, operating-wise in the quarter, about $45 million after-tax; it\u2019s important to note that the claims did settle back, generally speaking, within historical patterns by the end of the second quarter. Additionally, as you\u2019d expect, we conducted a variety of detailed analysis to see if there were any other unique causes to the pattern we saw a spike, and we found none. Also, as we noted, we completed reserve study in the second quarter, that resulted in a reserve strengthening of about $17 million after tax. So when you think about Life, taken together from an operating standpoint and from the reserve standpoint, altogether a little more than $60 million after tax. So net-net, clearly not happy with the results, we clearly believe they\u2019re temporary. Life will recover more quickly for the reasons you stated and disability will continue to recover throughout the remaining portion of 2016 and into 2017. As to the latter part of your question, you could think about the current year change in the outlook. It\u2019s split roughly 50-50 between the two lines of business. Matthew Borsch : Okay. Thank you for all that. I appreciate. And just so I understand though, that the - as you made these process changes, did that result in a lower level of catching disability claims that should have been remediated differently. And so in seeking to improve things it\u2019s gotten temporarily worse, is that the right way to think about it? David Cordani : Matthew, a way to think about that is, as you change the processes, and as I noted in my prepared remarks, more upfront and broader medical reviews, what you have is essentially, we\u2019ve triggered a temporary environment of longer claim durations and higher inventory, which we will work down throughout the residual part of this year as I noted. And we\u2019re already starting to see improvement relative to that. Matthew Borsch : And last question if I could, on the Medicare sanctions. Any outlook there, any - are you hopeful that you will get them resolved? Are you optimistic you\u2019ll get them resolved before open enrollment? David Cordani : Yes, Matthew, relative to the CMS audit, our team continues to work to resolve the issues and to drive the sustainable operational improvements that are necessary. As per timing, as you might frame there is three variety of alternatives here. We can get it remediated and validated before AEP, Annual Enrollment Period. We can get it remediated and validated during the cycle, or thoroughly we can get it remediated and validated after the cycle. Our team clearly understands the importance of that, but our broader objective here is to ensure that we successfully remediate all the issues and create a sustainable environment on a go-forward basis. And we will manage the next several months to make sure we\u2019re within the right position. Matthew Borsch : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you, Matthew. Our next question is from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning. I just to want to follow-up first on the Disability & Life business, David, you talked to this segment creating an earnings trajectory opportunity going forward, so looking for some more color here. What\u2019s a reasonable expectation in terms of the trajectory back to historical margins and earnings power in this business and how does that happen? Is it simply like you said, fixing the claims processing issue and Life reverting to normal? Or do we have to do some meaningful re-pricing here? David Cordani : Justin, good morning, your former conclusion is proper. We believe that the Life results will return to historical patterns and the Disability results, we continue to start seeing improvement throughout the second quarter and it will continue throughout the course of the year. Long term, we believe the - both the growth and earnings and margin profile of the business remain intact. We have work to do to establish that. And we will do that in the second-half of this year with a positive trajectory and continue that trajectory into 2017. Justin Lake : So, David, I mean, on the margins. I mean, your margin is going to be 1% to 2% this year on a business that historically been closer to 8%, let\u2019s call it. So can you just give us some color in terms of how should we think about that trajectory back to 8%, I mean, can you get half-way there, the 4% to 5% next year on the way back to 7% to 8% in 2018. Do you expect to get all the way back there next year? I mean, just can you help us with some visibility there? David Cordani : Yes. Justin, first and foremost just to make sure, we are clear on your first part of your initial question. I want to underscore this is an operational problem in disability, not fundamentally a pricing problem for us relative to the book of business. Hence if you, bring it across to your margin question, I think, a way to think about it is this arguably presents the single largest earnings step up opportunity for us, as we step from 2016 to 2017. So if you think about the headwinds and tailwinds, this is our number one tailwind. We expect to see meaningful improvement. We\u2019re not going to give you 2017 guidance at this point in time but away punctually that is as I noted in my prepared remarks, we expect to see the life business recover more rapidly. We expect to see the disability business continue to improve its performance throughout 2016 and into 2017. So for that, I would ask you to think about an ongoing improvement trajectory for the disability of portfolio flow through the second-half of this year, as well as into 2017. Giving us a good run rate, as we step out of 2017 into 2018. Justin Lake : Great. And then, just my follow up on capital deployment, I think, investors would love to hear anything you could share with us plan B, if this deal doesn\u2019t go through. I mean, I know the focus on getting the deal done. But it\u2019s not. You\u2019re going to have with a breakup fee something like $4 billion of cash that deploy and in under lever balance sheet. Can you share with us any thoughts there? David Cordani : Sure. So first and foremost, we have a long and clear track record of strong capital deployment and capital management. And it\u2019s part of that. We understand the importance of not letting surplus capital lie idle for any length of time. Our priorities remain clear and the same for supporting our business. Second strategic M&A and third returning excess capital to shareholders. To your point, we fully recognize the tremendous both capital as in free cash flow, as well as capital through balance sheet leverage flexibility we built over the last several years. In the event, taking your statement that the DOJ process is not successful. Our view is that as we look towards the second-half in later part of 2017, we would have $5 billion, a bit more than $5 billion of deployable cash plus a balance sheet. In the current situation, it sits at about 27% leverage. Our view is that normal course of business, we could add 10 points to that leverage. For strategic M&A, we could add 15 points to that leverage. So taking together truly tremendous value creation opportunity for shareholders in the event the DOJ process is not successful. We fully understand that and would expect to responsibly deploy that. Justin Lake : Great thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you Justin. Our next question is from Josh Raskin of Barclays. Your line is now open. Joshua Raskin : Thanks. I guess, I\u2019m just a little confused as to why this is also temporarily right. It sounded like last quarter, maybe let\u2019s start with disability in life. It sounded like that was considered a timing issue it doesn\u2019t sound like - it sounds like it\u2019s gotten materially worse. So I guess, I\u2019m just confused to why a process change would increase your actual incidents or is it not incident. It\u2019s just the inability to manage down these claims quickly. And I guess, I\u2019m just curious why that disappears so fast and then on life business, it doesn\u2019t sound like we kind of know the driver of the spike. So I\u2019m curious why your confident will get better. David Cordani : Good morning Josh. Very fair. So we\u2019ll take in a reverse order. Let\u2019s take life first. If you look at the life industry, players in the life industry unfortunately, it\u2019s the nature of the book of business will experience short-term temporary spikes or dislocations in cost. It transpires ideally, we like that not to happen, because you want consistent predictable environment. So to add to your point, as we noted that spike to a place in the early portion of the second quarter and as I noted in my prepared remarks and my comments, we saw a reversion of the life pattern within historical ranges towards the later part of the quarter. Secondly, we did a significant analysis to try to determine whether or not there were any unique drivers of that, as you would expect. And we didn\u2019t find any, and thirdly, there was a reserve study which was triggered a $70 million after tax strengthening, a way of looking at it otherwise it only triggered in a $70 million after tax strengthening. Specifically, disability you\u2019re right, we flagged this last quarter. Their operating changes that we put in places we noted, the results step down meaningfully in the first quarter, as I noted in my prepared remarks. We\u2019ve already seen progress in the second quarter relative to the improvement albeit any slower pace than we would like or projected. And we expect to continue to see that progress going forward and that offset ultimately the longer claim durations in the insurance rates that we\u2019re incurring currently as well as the elevated claim inventory. So important to know, we are seeing improvement in the disability results through the second quarter and expect that pattern to continue throughout the remaining portion of this year and into 2017. Joshua Raskin : And David, did you say, it\u2019s a 50-50 split on the $0.90 reduction in guidance between life and disability? David Cordani : Yes. Maybe let me try to - I did say that but I was looking at kind of where we are intra-year versus a full year. When you look at the full year pattern, I think it\u2019s a little safer to look at that is a two-third, one-third, because of the recovery pattern of the life being more rapid versus the disability pattern. What we have intra-quarter, I mean, it\u2019s a good $60 million delta in for quarter, but you have the two-thirds in the disability side and the one-third in the life over the course of the full year. Joshua Raskin : Okay. That makes more sense. And then follow up just on the healthcare business. Could you parse out - I guess one, I\u2019m a little surprised on the CMS cost, right. You guys knew about those sanctions before last quarter was announced, so is the process more onerous? Is it going to take a little bit longer? What\u2019s causing the CMS sanctioned response cost to be higher? And then how big is your individual book and maybe what\u2019s the size of the - how much of the $0.30 is individual versus CMS? David Cordani : Hey, Josh. I will start on the CMS piece, and I\u2019ll frame a little bit of the Individual, and then ask Tom to time to enhance that piece. First and foremost relative to our MA book of business. The fundamentals of the MA book of business continued to perform well. Very important and we\u2019re pleased with the performance both the service performance as well as the overall earnings performance of the book. You\u2019re correct, our cost of remediation is grown, we are seeking to ensure that the remediation is both completed is rapidly as possible, but also as comprehensively as possible. And it\u2019s unfortunately the case when you are doing a variety of complex bodies of work sometimes they are more complicated. Our number one priority, though, is to get this issue fully remediated and create the sustainable platform for the growth in the ongoing performance we expect for many years to come. So ultimately what transpired is more complexity to the work, necessary to build sustainability that we want for the growth profile, we see over the long term. But the operations in the day today fundamentals of the earnings performance to the base book of business continued to be strong. As relates to the Individual book of business, I last time to talked about the financials, but as you recall with continued to take a very focused and disciplined view to the marketplace primarily because we viewed from day one, the 2014, 2015, and 2016 would be, as we call it Version 1.0 of the marketplace, underscored by a smaller aggregate size and we initially projected, we call it a little bit of a choppy operating environment for the new marketplace as well as we projected for the industry to have more loses than not. And in hindsight, that\u2019s demonstrating itself. So I will ask Tom to describe a little bit about the financial impact for us. Thomas McCarthy : Josh, you are right, Individual is a small component of our business unfortunately sometimes it has more impact and we\u2019d like, particularly, it just sticking about the MCR, in fact this year quarter-over-quarter it explains most of the variability in our Commercial MCR, so small business, but shows up in some metrics that we don\u2019t like. And if we think about the revised outlook for the year, I\u2019m not going to give specifics, but let\u2019s say there\u2019s big chunks of both driving that maybe 50-50 somewhat in that range. Joshua Raskin : So the individual - Tom, do you have what the premium level or just a revenue number on the individual book is? I thought you guys were somewhere around 100,000 lives or something? Thomas McCarthy : A little more than that, I mean, that is disclosed - but that all those details are disclosed in the step supplement. Now if you\u2019re suggesting that, gee, how can it have that much of an impact. If you do the math, it actually can have that much of an impact. Joshua Raskin : Okay, all right. Maybe I will follow up with the math off-line. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Josh. Our next question is from A.J. Rice of UBS. Your line is now open. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hello, everybody. I know you hadn\u2019t given your medical cost trend for the commercial before, but I think you came out and said 4.5% to 5%. Can you just comment on away from the individual business, what are you seeing there? Any buckets that are running hot or any that are particularly positive? That cost trend obviously is lower than what others are saying they are seeing. David Cordani : A.J., Thank you, yes, we are really pleased with our medical trend results and we continue to build an very strong trend result we reported for several years as you pointed out with industry leading medical cost trends. Since most of our commercial customers are in self-funded arrangements and you recall they directly benefit from this well-managed medical trend. Our outlook has remained consistent this year with a full year trend outlook of 4.5% to 5.5% range decided. And that is in line with our 5% trend we reported in 2015, so consistent result. So overall, we\u2019re expecting to deliver another year of competitively strong medical trends and that reflects our focus on engaging customers in healthcare professionals to improve quality and affordability of care. And I wouldn\u2019t really call out any specific major changes in the underlying components. A.J. Rice: Okay. And then just my follow up I ask, I appreciate the comments David, you offered about the DOJ process and so forth and it makes sense that they came out with a decision to challenge the deal and you want to evaluate your options. Am I hearing you right to assume that, that sort of evaluation process whatever entailed has happened. And that now signals basically view, as we\u2019re going to play out the litigation and the interaction with the DOJ through to its conclusion and whatever evaluation was done has concluded. Is that the way to think about it? David Cordani : A.J., yes. But so you\u2019re absolutely correct in my prepared remarks. So I indicate that we briefly step back we wanted to make sure we understood the fact statements from the DOJ and that states quite well and deeply and understand that. The bad aspect of it means we were fully engaged, continue to be fully engaged in the process. We both support our contractual obligations as we have provided. So but to continue on that dialogue to be clear as we noted, Anthem has been running the regulatory process which is consistent with the contract. Anthem independently decided to pursue the lawsuit with the DOJ, as such we are party of that suit. We will take the appropriate steps obviously, to protect the interest of our shareholders, which includes ongoing evaluation and monitoring more options as they unfold. But we are fully engaged in the process as you noted. And we should think about that, but it\u2019s a dynamic process right. There is no static process season life and this is not a static process, but we\u2019re fully engaged. A.J. Rice: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you A.J., our next question is from Gary Taylor of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. A few questions, first, just going back to the disability segment, on disability itself how much of the quarterly, your annual premiums are short-term versus long-term disability, ballpark? David Cordani : Follow up with that. I mean, much of our short-term disability business is so oriented, but we\u2019ll follow up with you exactly. Gary Taylor : Okay. And you talked about an improvement in the segment, particularly in the life and the near term and obviously the implied guidance for the second-half of the year and the segment is much better than the first-half, then you talked about improvement in the 2017. Is it fair to say that if we take I believe the implied guidance for disability might for the second-half of the year is $37 million to $77 million. If we annualize that is it fair to say that would be the low end what 2017 should be. Given that, you think there is an improving trajectory. David Cordani : Gary it\u2019s David. Again, we\u2019re not providing 2017 guidance. We have expectations for ourselves to dramatically improve the result as we step into 2017. We think, we have the opportunity to obviously to see the life results revert to historical patterns more rapidly and the disability pattern will continue to improve overtime. I don\u2019t want to validate your numbers again, because we\u2019re not providing 2017 guidance, but as I mentioned to Justin, this represents the largest contributor or largest tailwind. And as when we step from 2016 to 2017 and we hold ourselves to the higher expectation to achieve those numbers a better. Gary Taylor : Two more quick ones if I could. Could we just go back to, you keep saying this disability which is an operational, as you\u2019ve driven by these medical claims or views. So are you saying that you\u2019re doing more detailed longer duration reviews and it\u2019s causing to pay out more days of disability than you believe it will be on these claims in the future. And\u2026 David Cordani : Gary, at a macro level the picture you carry is I think, directionally correct. Just stepping back and add to that. So more resources, clinical resources, specialties and other wise, added to the front end of the processes to enable more comprehensive reviews than even was being done before, over long-term enhances, further enhances customer experience, further enhances the efficiency of the overall process. And it is aligned with emerging regulatory best practices for the space. Over the immediate term, the description is some of the effect that you may reference to. And we are rapidly working to improve those results, day in, week in, month in, month out. Gary Taylor : So these are self-inflicted delays, basically, you are trying to fix. David Cordani : That is absolutely correct. Gary Taylor : And last question. I think in response to Justin, you talked about taking leverage potentially into the mid-30s if the Anthem deal doesn\u2019t move forward on possibly other strategic M&A, or just conceptually willing to do that. What about for share repurchase? How much would we be willing to move debt to cap for accelerated share repurchase, or is the same ballpark in the scope of possibilities? David Cordani : Gary, the - we don\u2019t parse in terms of which of the deployment components we would prioritized moving leverage up or down for, other than as I noted in the prior comments, strategic M&A enables your from our point of view to temporarily expand leverage at even further. I think your broader point and to reiterate, we recognize that is there is in unsuccessful DOJ process, as you go into the latter part of 2017, we would have ordered magnitude $5 billion or $5 billion plus of deployable cash. A current environment of leverage situation of approximately 27% in the ability to add at least 10 points to that in the various scenarios we identified. And share repurchase would be a part of the calculus we would be looking to. Net-net under a variety of scenarios the opportunity to create significant shareholder value off of both the cash-on-hand and leverage capabilities. Gary Taylor : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, Gary. Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Just wanted to clarify a question earlier, when you were saying the breakout in group and life being one-third, two-thirds for the year, that\u2019s on the $0.90 you are saying, basically that $0.30 is life and $0.60 is disability. Is that what you were saying? David Cordani : Correct. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then I guess just wondering if you\u2019ve seen - obviously you\u2019ve had the deal out there for a year now. Wondering if you\u2019ve seen any impact to the core business at all from the customer perspective, either on retention or as you go out to bid? Is this creating an overhang as far as your ability to retain or to win new business? David Cordani : Hey, Kevin, good morning. This is David. So broadly speaking our team has done an outstanding job of ensuring we first and foremost are delivering on our promises to our existing customers, which is job one, hence, our client and customer retention levels have been very strong, and we are pleased and proud with that. Second, we expected as we announced this deal that given the long regulatory timeframe we anticipated that over that timeframe as it continued to extend, it may cause a bit lower traction on new-new business. And I say new-new purpose, because in between that is new business off of existing relationships. So point one is our retention has been strong and outstanding due to great service deliver by the franchise, and high attention, and then support from our customers and clients, and we obviously work very hard for that every day. Two, we\u2019ve been able to successfully expand relationships throughout our various lines of business. And three, we have been able to grow new relationships. Net-net, our covered lives are up and our portfolio penetration is up. We have seen some impact of a little lower close ratio in some situations where some clients want to weighted out, but I would say that\u2019s the smallest portion of the overall equation. When you put a bow around the whole package, we are pleased to have achieved our revenue outlook thus far for the year and is aided by that very strong retention rate in the strong expansion relationships. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then just I guess on the MA side of things, I guess we\u2019ve obviously seen how the MA membership has gone from an attrition perspective from quarter to quarter with the sanction. Is this way you will think of - if we assume a negative outcome, and you are not able to get this fixed by the open enrollment period, would that transition from kind of Q4 to Q1 be a similar drop in your view? Is that the way to think about it, or would you think that that would be a more disruptive time period around membership? David Cordani : So Kevin, let me just make sure I understood your hypothesis for starters. A way to think about 2016 is we started the year with good covered life growth for MA mid- to upper- single-digits. And we expect that to flatten out throughout the course of the year due to the non-ongoing enrollment and disenrollment pattern that would unfold. Therefore, under your hypothesis, if we are not active in any dimensions of the annual enrollment period, obviously we wouldn\u2019t be picking up the new lives and you\u2019d have attrition throughout the course of the year. And I would actually think about it is that - attrition throughout the course of the year, not attrition in any one might - obviously the annual enrollment period is an important marker that would manifest itself. So we\u2019ve seen continued attrition throughout the course of the year coming more to a flat result at the end of 2016, in terms of net life growth, and there would be arguably stated a similar pattern overall for 2017 in the event of your scenario, but we wouldn\u2019t be starting with step-up point that we started up for 1-1-2016. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. The question is, if you have to go through an open enrollment period where you can\u2019t get new lives and there\u2019s going to be theoretically some shopping, I was just trying to understand how persistent you think your core business would be in that scenario over the next year. Is it just a situation that we always lose, I don\u2019t know, 5%, but you always gain 15%, so you are growing 10%? Now you would be entering an open enrollment period where you lose 5% and there\u2019s no ability to pick something up. I just wasn\u2019t sure if that Q4 to Q1 was going to be a more disruptive drop point or if that membership is just more sticky? David Cordani : I think, first and foremost your normal kind of pattern of assumptions is more direct. Secondly, our retention rate in this portfolio tends to be quite strong, especially when we have relationships that are onboard for over one year in our MA book of business. Those relationships become very well established with our physician collaborative model and have a high retention, and we would expect to carry a very strong retention rate in, but your notion relative to not having the new business would be an offset. I wouldn\u2019t view any unique event would transpire beyond that. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Kevin. Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe of Citi. Your line is now open. Ralph Giacobbe : Great, thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify, yes, last quarter, in the release, it was cited that the timing of reserve review on the disability and life would move from second to third quarter, and I think I heard you say you did do the review this quarter? Is that fair, so there shouldn\u2019t be risk of further adjustment? And then a couple of times, David, you\u2019ve cited emerging regulatory processes. Just hoping maybe you can provide some color on exactly what that is. Thomas McCarthy : So Ralph, it\u2019s Tom. I will address the reserve study dynamics first. So we completed this quarter with a life reserve study and that study covers in fact claim development factors interest rate assumptions, all the normal things you look at life businesses. What we highlighted last quarter was that we\u2019re deferring a disability claims study to later in the year given the changes in the visibility claims process. And in fact, we haven\u2019t completed that study. We still are completing it - expecting to complete it in last half of the year. And of course, we won\u2019t know the results of that study until it\u2019s completed. But I would just observe to maybe get to the heart of your question, that given the current environment any significant impact from that study one way or the other seems unlikely. David Cordani : Relative to the regulatory question. First, we have a very differentiated disability model, despite the earnings issues we\u2019re confronting in 2016. Like all of our businesses, they all come under a variety of regulatory forces. Relative to the disability space, specifically emerging best practices are pointing towards more. While we always have had upfront medical resources. For example, emerging best practices are pointing towards more upfront resources, more user specialists, more comprehensive physical examinations upfront for a broader variety of scenarios. And those are illustrative of the types of changes we are putting in place, as we see where the regulatory direction is going. And we want to ensure that we continue to position this book of business as an industry leader, as it relates to the disability management process and the disability productivity management process. So those are illustrative of some of the right type of emerging regulatory patterns. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then, just in terms of the financial flexibility that you cited, I think, commentary last quarter in the release that was unlikely that you\u2019d make sort of further repurchase above and beyond what you had done through I guess, May, and make any incremental this quarter. That language wasn\u2019t sort of in the release this time around. I guess, I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re open to or maybe remind this what you can do in terms of share repurchase at this time. And how we should think about sort of capital deployment if there is a challenge that goes into next year? Thanks. David Cordani : Sure. Ralph, so we carry the flexibilities. You asked a broader question on capital deployment. You asked relative to share repurchase. Let me take the other dimension of it. Under the merger agreement, we have the ability to be active from an M&A standpoint. There are mutual limits going in both directions. The mutual limits point toward in aggregate over the life of the contract $600 million and a transaction cap of $200 million. So transactions up to $200 million and cumulative transactions up to $600 million, that mutual going in both directions, relative to share repurchase, there are also limits in both directions specific to us we have about $725 million of capacity left under those contractual obligations. At this point in time, again with the transaction pending we view it as less likely that would be the significant share repurchase over the immediate term horizon. But we do have the capacity to do so under the merger agreement and as I noted, approximately, $725 million of remaining capacity. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you Ralph. [Operator Instructions] our next question is from Andrew Schenker of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Andrew Schenker : Hey, thanks. I just wonder, if you could just help us maybe try to quantify in total the CMS audit costs incorporated in 2016 earnings, including the new assumptions you heighted today. And then just how we should be thinking about some of this cost. I mean, how much of them are one-time just preparing for the audits versus what are really actually now ongoing cost that we needed to strengthen your MA systems to help your positioning there? And then how is that reflected all in your bids for next year, assuming the sanctions are lifted. Thank you. Thomas McCarthy : So Andy, its Tom. You\u2019ve got couple dynamics going in there. First, we are spending more than we expected on CMS audit remediation costs. And the total spend in the second quarter was about - or year-to-date was about $30 million, at second quarter it was about $30 million after tax. So that kind of gives you an order of magnitude of the size of the total spend we\u2019re talking about. So we haven\u2019t mentioned exactly the overall outlook for the year. But you can - based on that spend, you can expect a sizeable amount. Some of that probably does end up back in the run rate and at least in the near term as we institute more robust processes. But much of that is one-time spend to get us to the remediation period. And I don\u2019t think, we\u2019ve seen any significant impact on our bid related to that dynamic. Andrew Schenker : Okay. And then, for individual, once again always with the caveat that I understand it\u2019s a small portion of your business, but a volatile one. I mean, can you maybe talk about how you did position that book for next year? It looks like you are maybe actually entering a few new market. So do you think total costs or profitability for individual is actually going to approximately decline next year. Given new market entrants or given any repositioning in existing markets? Could we see overall profitability for individual actually go up next year. Thank you. David Cordani : Andy, good morning. It\u2019s David. So as for the results just for your context as we noted we continue to experience losses within elevated impact in certain markets. Important to know, we have seen the performance of what we look at as our newest offerings as being markedly better than the traditional offerings that we had placed in the market and many have in the market. So those new offerings are aided or driven by very focused and aligned collaborative delivery system models. And those are performing better. As well as in 2017, you\u2019re right. First and foremost at this point we plan for and expect to continue to participate. We\u2019ve taken posture to position ourselves in a limited number of new markets, where we have the ability to put in place those aligned collaborative delivery system models. And also relative to the disruption we\u2019re seeing from a results standpoint, we continue to have active engagement and dialogue with both CMS and state agencies to ensure that we are mutually enabled to be focus on those areas and programs, where we could address this sustained value which really are pivoting of those collaborative delivery system models. We would expect to improve our performance year over year, but this is a volatile marketplace which is why we kept it is a relatively speaking small portion of our portfolio. Andrew Schenker : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you Andy. Our next question is from Christine Arnold of Cowen. Your line is now open. Christine Arnold : Hey, I\u2019m still confused on the disability situation. I\u2019m just not a disability expert. I would think that if you are doing more upfront examinations and medical specialist intervention, you\u2019d find people who really aren\u2019t qualified for the disability benefit, maybe the fakers and the frauders. So how - I don\u2019t understand how the upfront medical management improvement is actually resulting in an increase in disability claims. David Cordani : Christine, good morning. It\u2019s David. So as they indicated, as we put these process changes in place to be clear and obviously we expect the net result of it to be on improved outcome. Half of a book of business that has generally and consistently delivered industrial-leading productivity and financial performance in part for some of the hypothesis you make reference to, to make sure we\u2019re more pinpointed, even more shortly pinpointed in terms of the disability events. The result though of changing the processes, the staffing, the workflows etcetera has resulted in the temporary disruption. Not one that we like and that is more prolonged than we have planned for. But the outcome and result will be improved customer experience and improved overall efficiency and effectiveness. And that\u2019s what your comments point toward. So we are fully aligned with that. Christine Arnold : So the fact that we have all these specialists reviewing means that for those that are legitimate they are on disability longer because we are spending more time with them, but I don\u2019t see how that reverses. David Cordani : Christine, a different way of thinking about it is, if you think about a multi-location significant workflow change, staffing model change, operating protocol change. What\u2019s transpiring is in your question your base hypothesis of where the engagement destination is right, but in the interim, what\u2019s happening is actually in some cases more people on disability or longer duration disability events which are temporary until, we work through and finalize the process enhancements. And as I noted, we\u2019re already seeing improvements in those patterns in the second quarter, albeit not at the rate and pace we would like them to be and expect to continue to see that improvement pattern Q3, Q4, Q1 as we go forward. Christine Arnold : Okay. And then the government loss ratio was up year-over-year kind of more than consensus and certainly what we expected. Is that because of the sanctions? Are we experiencing maybe a higher loss ratio, because we are not getting in the healthier MA numbers? How do I think about that, what appears to be an elevated government loss ratio? Thank you. David Cordani : Christine, that isn\u2019t a factor at all. So underlying the MCR, our focus on physician engagement continues to deliver exactly the results we\u2019d expect - quality and affordable care to Medicare Advantage customers. So the sanctions have not had an impact. The quarter-over-quarter impact is two major factors. First, there\u2019s less favorable impact from prior year development - from favorable prior year development, so we had significant favorable prior year development last year de minimis amount of prior year development this year. Second, we are seeing some impact from the growth in the recent market expansions, and those markets, when we first did launch a market, tend to run at a higher MCR than our established markets, so that\u2019s somewhat shown up as a little bit of an increase in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. But underlying the results, so excluding the prior year, our Medicare advantage business results in the MCR are very consistent with our expectations. Christine Arnold : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Christine. Our next question is from Scott Fidel of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Scott Fidel : Thanks. I had a question just on the CMS review and the interplay in terms of M&A, and David, saw you highlighted that you have the ability under the agreement to do some acquisitions. So just interested in terms of on the Medicare side, are there restrictions on whether you can participate in doing acquisitions, while you have a sanction in place, or is that sort of a separate dynamic? David Cordani : Good morning, Scott. We expect to see M&A opportunities as we go forward in the marketplace. So as you recall first broadly, one of our priorities for M&A has been and continues to be seniors and MA in a broader sense of the word. We are not aware of any impediment in any way, shape or form correlating the sanctions to our ability to be active from an M&A standpoint even in the current period. Scott Fidel : Okay. And then just a follow-up question. Just on individual, can you just give us an update, Tom, on where you are expecting the individual margin to be for 2016 in the guidance now? Thomas McCarthy : Scott, I don\u2019t think, we are going to give specific details, but you can rest assured it\u2019s going to have a negative sign in front of it. Scott Fidel : Okay, all right. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Scott. Our next question is from Chris Rigg of Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Chris Rigg : Good morning. Just wanted to come back to disability quickly here. Historically, you would guide by segment and I guess because of Anthem you just threw out a blanket number. Clearly, you substantially overhauled the business. Can you give us a sense for what was in the original baseline, how much earnings pressure you were expecting versus the $0.60-ish we are seeing now? Thanks. [Technical Difficulty] Operator : One moment participants. We are just experiencing a technical issue. Chris Rigg : Hello. David Cordani : Again, apologize, it sounds like we temporarily had a line issue. Chris Rigg : Hi, David. Chris still here. Can you hear me? David Cordani : If you don\u2019t mind starting over your question, unfortunately the line blanks out for period. Chris Rigg : Okay, yes, I just asked what was in the original baseline for disability and life given you didn\u2019t provide guidance by segment. How much pressure were you expecting because of the overhaul of the disability business in the original outlook versus the $0.60-ish of additional pressure we are seeing now? Thanks. David Cordani : Yes, so, Chris, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to reconcile in detail. But a way to think about it is, and we tried to be very clear both in the press release and our comments today, you could think about, as we step from the first quarter results to this quarter, taking everything into consideration for the impact of the Disability business and the Life business, we noted a $0.90 change for the full-year to our EPS outlook. And to the prior comments, we indicated - you could think about that as approximately driven by two-thirds of the Disability portfolio and one-third by the Life portfolio. Chris Rigg : Okay. But just to - Sorry to come back to this, but were you originally expecting earnings in the Disability segment to decline in 2016 relative to 2015? David Cordani : We have not provided segment outlook for you. But as we stepped into the year, our expectations stepped down from start of the year through the first quarter. We knew we had operational changes. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, it is clear that the magnitude of the impact and the timeframe to remediate is longer. So we understood we are putting those processes in place. We believe we made provisions for that. But the impact is, order of magnitude is significant to that. So I think the, A, understanding, we knew we\u2019re making the process changes; B, put some provisions forward for that. But at the end of the day, the most important part for you to think about is that $0.90 impact for the year as we sit today, with the majority of that and two-thirds of that were specifically being driven by disability. Chris Rigg : Okay, I\u2019ll leave it there, thank you. Operator : Thank you, Chris. Our next question is from Ana Gupte of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open. Ana Gupte : Yes, thanks, good morning. So I was trying to figure out your normalized margins and your outlook for some of your segments. And on the Medicare segment, I think you said that the development issue or the lack thereof is not because of the sanctions. I think you are running at fairly low single-digit margins now after a huge amount of margin-compression post the HealthSpring acquisition. Might we still think of your ability to expand margins into next year or have these sanctions and the claims audit process or anything there CMS is asking likely to put some more pressure there or at least leave your margins flat from where they are right now? David Cordani : Good morning. It\u2019s David. So, first and foremost, the core MA business, absent the step-uping cost for the MA sanctions activity is performing well; two, as we look to 2017, to the core of your question, we would expect to improve margins, in part driven by the run-off or absence of the sanction costs; and three, maybe broadly inferring your questions, we continue to look at this as attractive in both growth and earnings segment, from the ability to both grow it and have attractive margins over time, as we leverage the proven physician engagement models we have. Ana Gupte : Okay, great. Then next, the other segment that\u2019s really a big growth segment is your Select segment with the stop-loss. And there was a change in the national definition originally to 100 they then got back from that. Certain States still do it, but maybe they are putting some restrictions on small groups that are trying to do ASO plus stop-loss. How do you see this playing out and might you still see double-digit growth in that segment from a membership perspective on an ongoing basis? David Cordani : Yes, Ana, thank you. First just to define for everybody\u2019s benefit, when we talk Select segment for our company, this is for employers with 51 to 250 employees, so the over 50 marketplace. We have focused on bringing innovative, transparent, both engagement and incentive-based models. And over time, our results here have been tremendous, not just from a growth standpoint, earnings standpoint, but from the value we deliver back to those employers and employees by having those aligned models. As for results, we yet grown again this year, our customer base and the pattern, at least on a year-to-date basis, is similar to last year\u2019s pattern. And to core of your question, we continue to see this as an attractive growth market as employers in that space continue to look more aggressively toward alternatives that again are transparent and aligned and these programs are performing well and we\u2019re excited and optimistic about the future for this business. Ana Gupte : And then finally, just one follow-up on the individual, if I may. What\u2019s the pressure on continued on off-exchange? I recall you had something in the first year of Obamacare, or is this now on-exchange business, so the claims experience is coming in ahead of your expectations? David Cordani : Well, Ana, we\u2019re seeing pressure both in the on-exchange ACA compliance and the off-exchange ACA compliance. Ana Gupte : And you expect both? David Cordani : Expect both, meaning our assumption for the remaining part of the year, yes. And as we noted before those programs that have the most advanced models with the physician lines collaborative are performing better. And our expectation is to position as many markets as we\u2019re going to be in with those models into 2017. Operator : Thank you, Ana. Our next question is from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Peter Costa : Thanks. Help me with my math here a little bit. I think you talked about the Life business having $62 million in charges in the quarter. So that got like $0.24 and then Disability, you said $0.60 for the year. So if it\u2019s going to improve through the year it\u2019s at least $0.21 this quarter. And then, CMS you described is about a $0.12 problem, so all told, little over $0.60 in pressure this quarter. You only missed consensus by about $0.40. Was there some business, that outperformed in the quarter or did we just have the seasonal pattern wrong and so we missed your expectations by a much bigger amount, and then like accounting the individual business, which would have also impacted the quarter. David Cordani : Peter, good morning. It\u2019s David. As we noted, our employer healthcare business and our global supplement or our global individual business continues to perform very well. Obviously, that performance was eclipsed by the items you made reference to. So as you\u2019re looking for offsets or the positive forces, the positive forces come out of those two large well-performing businesses with the offsets that you made reference to. Peter Costa : And then, that would imply that there is some further negatives going on in the back-half of the year in those businesses or something you should - unless the numbers were wrong relative to before as well. David Cordani : Peter, I\u2019d ask you to think about, every business has seasonality patterns that will capture them. So for example, in the employer healthcare business, we always have an uptick in spending in the latter part of the year to prepare for 1-1 activities and enrollment activities et cetera. That\u2019s illustration of moment of seasonal patterns in the book of business. The MORs tends to perform differently because of the high deductibility plans et cetera. Peter Costa : Which is theoretically was already accounted for, I understand that. But I\u2019m trying to figure out if there is something incrementally negative in the back part of the year in those other businesses that wasn\u2019t laid out. David Cordani : Simple answer is no. Peter Costa : Okay. And then, just as part of that, if you don\u2019t mind. Relative to the CMS audit have you started to change your marketing plans at this point. If you\u2019re not yet approved, there is going to be a point where you have to start marketing. And we\u2019re getting towards. So is there any impact at this point in terms of your marketing plans for seniors? David Cordani : Peter, obviously, a very important point you raised. We\u2019re quite cognizant of the timing of the decision criteria, et cetera. And our team is poised to be able to dynamically manage that as the next 30 day window unfolds in front of us and we\u2019re prepared to make whatever trade up decisions we need to make as our final judgment around the enrollment cycle unfold. Peter Costa : Do you believe you\u2019ll have a ruling from CMS before certainly the minimum amount of time for you to still be able market for next year as we\u2026? David Cordani : I\u2019m not going to comment or speculate on CMS\u2019s conclusion. Most important piece is we are 100% focused on fully remediating and getting the validation as quickly as possible so we can put ourselves in a sustainable position. Obviously, we\u2019ll update you as soon as we have clarity and conclusions at our final step there. Peter Costa : If you don\u2019t market what would be the earnings impact? And that\u2019s my last question. David Cordani : I\u2019m not disclosing at this point in time. As we noted, we expect as we look forward for 2017, we have margin improvement opportunities in the Medicare book of business, in part driven by the removal of the remediation costs. And then we\u2019ll talk further as the year unfolds relative to 2017 guidance more comprehensively. Operator : Thank you, Peter. Our next question is from Tom Carroll of Stifel. Your line is now open. Thomas Carroll : Hi, there. Just a follow-up on the Disability side of things, will the changes being made take you back to kind of your 7% or 8% margin level or will the process, hopefully improvements being done create a longer term perhaps higher level of margins in this business than we have seen? David Cordani : Tom, it\u2019s David. Broadly speaking, we\u2019ve been quite pleased over elongated period of times for both the intersection of the service and productivity service delivery provide the clients and customers. The ongoing growth of that portfolio of business in very difficult economic times, low interest rates, low employment or growth rates, et cetera, and a tremendous margin level, our strategic objective has been to maintain margins in line with our historic performance and continue to grow that book in that portfolio. These investments will put us in position to continue to further improve the customer experience, as I note before, be aligned emerging regulator best practices and be in position to, again, achieve those margins on a long-term basis. Thomas Carroll : Okay. So kind of impact the - or make better the infrastructure, but not necessarily move you to a different margin level, it sound like I\u2019m hearing. David Cordani : I think that\u2019s a good way of thinking about it. And as we think about infrastructure as I noted before, this is not a technology program, it\u2019s a workflow and human capital program. Thomas Carroll : Right, and then just one administrative follow-up, did you say, you\u2019d be willing to raise your debt to total cap level higher than the 10 percentage points that you mentioned for a strategic opportunity that was compelling? David Cordani : So to be clear, we operated about 27% today, low based on historic levels, low based on our goals and objectives. Okay, we see the ability to raise that 10 points where I\u2019ll call it ordinary course of business and illustratively 15 points for strategic M&A. Operator : Thank you, Tom. Our next question is from Sarah James of Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. Sarah James : Thanks for taking me in. Can you help us understand what portion of the MA annual sell-in costs are variable, something you could scale back on if sanctions weren\u2019t lifted in time for the normal marketing and selling season? And what\u2019s the timeline of when you have to commit to things like outside call-center contracting, ad-buys, print marketing materials? David Cordani : Sarah, good morning, it\u2019s David. Broadly speaking, you should think about the vast majority of the cost and resources for purposes of annual enrollment period as largely being variable. So if you\u2019re putting them in buckets, nothing has ever hit 100%. But you should think about them as largely variable. Two, as noted by prior callers, the timeframe is rapidly coming up on us to make final decisions relative to ramping and staging. That\u2019s both beneficial that is not a cliff decision in terms of your structure, that\u2019s the variability aligned with the longitude of dial-up and dial-down. And we would expect to be confronting some focused decisions over the near-term 30-plus-day window and how we focus on that. Sarah James : Got it, and can you remind us how you are thinking about Medicaid? Is that an attractive business in your opinion? And is there a portion of that market that you are more inclined towards? David Cordani : Sarah, historically, we prioritized Medicaid below certain other segments, so seniors or Medicare, expanding our global footprint, expanding our retails capabilities as examples. We have a view that over time that the Medicare marketplace would continue to move more toward, we\u2019ll use the broad term, managed Medicaid, programs within States to focus on high-risk populations where we believe we have the opportunity to create differentiated value through physician collaborative or clinical models, et cetera. And we believe over time that will continue to present opportunities, be it organically or inorganically. So as a subset of the Medicaid world as it allows where we believe we could actually differentiated values through either clinical engagement, physician engagement or both. Operator : Thank you, Sarah. Our last question comes from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Dave Windley : Hi, thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in. So if I read a couple comments in the press release correctly, you talk about lack of meaningful prior-year reserve development in the current quarter and you say a relatively small amount or less than last year in Medicare. Does that imply that the commercial PYD was actually negative or was it just a very small number, small positive number? David Cordani : Dave, I\u2019d think of the prior-year this way. And so in the quarter we had about the same level of favorable prior-year development in our commercial employer business this year and last year, but we have reductions in both individual and Medicare and that resulted in an overall de minimis amount for the entire company. Dave Windley : Okay. Okay, so kind of answered my follow-up. It was going to be, as it relates to trend, and, Tom, I think you commented on this earlier, but it\u2019s consistent with where you started the year, I don\u2019t think you really commented on individual buckets. But maybe you could comment on any bias within the range? Is the commercial part of the group part of that trend? I don\u2019t think you include individual in trend. But how is that biased within the range, perhaps? Thomas McCarthy : Well, Dave, actually individual is included, but so is our broader employer business. So in the overall scheme of things individual is a smaller contribution to the trend result. And as I said, when this came up earlier, we really don\u2019t see any significant changes in the underlying trend factor in the components. Dave Windley : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Dave. At this time I would like to hand the call back to Mr. David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : Thank you. So just briefly to conclude our call, I\u2019d like to highlight some key points. Cigna\u2019s second quarter results reflected solid revenue and earnings contributions from a Global Healthcare and Global Supplemental Benefits business, and a disappointing financial performance in our Group Disability & Life segment, reflective of short-term challenges that will improve. The 40,000 outstanding members of the Cigna team around the globe work diligently every day to fulfill our mission of improving the health, well-being, and sense of security of the people we serve. And we will seek to continue to effectively operate our business, guided by our strategic framework to create sustained value for our customers, clients and shareholders. Again, we thank you for joining our call today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna\u2019s second quarter 2016 results review. Cigna Investor Relations will be available to respond to additional questions shortly. A recording of this conference will be available for 10 business days following this call.

At this time, all callers are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter the queue to ask questions at that time. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the question-and-answer session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell. William McDowell - Cigna Corp.: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's third quarter 2016 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2016. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses first certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on this same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders' net income, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2016 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, I note that in the third quarter, we recorded two charges to shareholders' net income, which we reported as special items. The first special item was an after-tax charge of $46 million or $0.18 per share for merger-related transaction costs. The second special item was an after-tax charge of $25 million or $0.10 per share related to a litigation matter. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of third quarter 2016 results. Also, consistent with past practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or additional prior-year development of medical costs. And with that, I will turn the call over to David. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Thanks, Will, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll begin with a review of highlights from the third quarter. I will also discuss how our ability to anticipate and meet customer and client needs through innovation, engagement and value-based programs continue to drive our business performance. Then I'll discuss how our well-positioned businesses continue to deliver strong results for the benefit of our shareholders and how we are driving improvements for our businesses that are currently underperforming their potential. We were doing all of this while we continue to prepare for the future by investing in capabilities that meet customers' needs and while we continue to support the litigation process with our proposed Anthem combination. Next, Tom will provide more detail around our third quarter financial performance and our full year outlook. And following your questions, I'll conclude our conversation with just a few closing remarks. Let's begin with some highlights from the quarter. Our third quarter 2016 consolidated revenue increased 5% to $9.9 billion over the third quarter 2015. We reported adjusted income from operations for the third of $503 million or $1.94 per share reflecting strong performance in our Commercial Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses and improving results in our Group Disability and Life segment. Our actions continue to be guided by our proven strategy of Go Deep, Go Global, Go Individual, with a focus on anticipating and meeting the needs of our customers and clients through ongoing innovation and a commitment to being a trusted partner, as well as continuing investments for future growth and capabilities, which deliver affordable, personalized solutions and further expand our geographic reach. Around the world, individuals are seeking access to quality health care and sense-of-security programs that are both of high quality and affordable. At the same time, employers of all sizes and across all industries and geographies increasingly recognize that healthier, more engaged and productive workforces are essential to driving their businesses forward, while they continue to seek solutions that are affordable and sustainable. Amid this backdrop, many individuals and employers are concerned that they must accept either constrained access or diminished quality, or both, in order to achieve affordability of care. At Cigna, we see it differently. We have demonstrated that quality and affordability can be achieved by designing personally tailored access and high-quality care delivery with engagement, alignment and support for individuals and health care professionals. We deliver this through personalized and localized benefits as well services for our customers, which empower and support their actions and decision-making and enable them to find the right balance of access, quality and affordability. At the same time, we support health care personals with actionable insights and further expanded care resources, all the while ensuring alignment with them to deliver superior quality and improved affordability. To further innovate for our customers and clients, we are accelerating investments in value-based care programs and incentive payment models with our provider partners that continue to drive enhancements in both care quality and affordability. For example, today, we have 160 collaborative accountable care arrangements, which span 29 states. And we serve well over 2 million customers in these value-based programs. Our success in driving increased affordability is reflected in our continued delivery of industry-leading medical cost trend. In support of that, 82% of our more mature collaborative relationships with large physician groups have outperformed the market in total medical cost. This leadership in physician partnership was also most recently validated through Cigna's first place ranking amongst 214 companies in athenahealth's provider satisfaction survey. Our ability to anticipate, identify and help satisfy these needs continues to resonate with our customers and clients as well as our provider partners. Importantly, across all of our businesses, our customer and client experience remains at high levels. As a result, retention remains strong, and this presents ongoing opportunities for further expansion of our customer and client relationships. Importantly, these long-term relationships allow us to support individuals more meaningfully across their life and health stages. Now, relative to our businesses, we have an opportunity to improve performance. Throughout the third quarter, we made solid progress in our efforts to improve the financial results of our Group Disability and Life segment. As the model begins to mature, this will lead to a further differentiated customer experience. Relative to Cigna-HealthSpring, we continue to make progress in the CMS audit remediation work. Our focus remains on completing this work and growing our business with industry-leading collaborative relationships, all to drive positive outcomes for the benefit of seniors. We expect to emerge from this work with a stronger, more sustainable model that ensures seniors will continue to receive the highest quality service experience and clinical outcomes. So to summarize, our well-performing businesses continue to deliver strong results, and we are driving improvements where needed. This, combined with our ongoing investments for the future and our tremendous capital resources positions us with strength and flexibility to deliver sustained value for customers and clients and differentiated results for our shareholders. Now, as we look forward to 2017, we expect to deliver attractive financial performance and growth. We see a number of earnings tailwinds, including continued strong performance of our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses, with high customer retention levels and solid revenue and earnings growth. Second, more meaningful improvement in the margin for our Disability and Life business. And third, meaningful margin improvement for our Seniors business. With the ramp down of remediation costs, we'll more than offset the headwind caused by the revenue reductions that we expect for 2017 in this business. As always, there may be variability in 2017 in the rate and pace of both medical utilization as well as the pace of our strategic investments. When we take the tailwinds and headwinds as a whole and consider our significant capital position and ongoing strong free cash flow generation, we are well-positioned for an attractive 2017. Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to reiterate some of the key points from my remarks this morning. Cigna's operating a well-positioned, diversified portfolio of businesses dedicated to meeting our customers' needs and delivering value through engagement, incentive alignment and support services. As we look ahead to 2017, we will continue our momentum in our well-performing businesses and improve the results in some of our historical strong businesses. Our long-term objective remains commitment to our annual growth of 10% to 13% EPS on average, all while we continue to invest back in our company. And the high levels of ongoing free cash flow generated from our diverse business portfolio and tremendous capital resources available for deployment give us a strong degree of flexibility to pursue further value-creation options for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom. Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.: Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter 2016 results and discuss our outlook for the full year. Key financial highlights in the quarter are : consolidated revenues of $9.9 billion, consolidated earnings of $503 million, quarterly earnings per share of $1.94, and continued strong free cash flow and financial flexibility. This quarter's result reflects continued strong revenue and earnings contributions from our Commercial Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses and improved results in our Group Disability and Life business. Regarding our business segments, I will first comment on Global Health Care. Third quarter premiums and fees in Global Health Care grew to $6.8 billion. Third quarter earnings were $416 million, reflecting continued strong performance in our Commercial business driven by customer growth, strong specialty results and favorable medical cost outcomes. Offsetting these strong Commercial results were elevated costs in our Government business related to our CMS audit response and some loss ratio pressure primarily in our Medicaid offerings in Texas and Illinois. Turning to our Global Supplemental Benefits business, premiums and fees grew 9% and earnings of $81 million represent growth of 31% quarter-over-quarter or 25% on a currency-adjusted basis, reflecting business growth and strong operating expense discipline. This business continues to achieve attractive growth and profitability as we deliver value to our customers with personalized and affordable offerings in the supplemental benefit space. For Group Disability and Life, third quarter results reflect premium and fee growth of 4% over third quarter 2015. Third quarter earnings in our Group business were $53 million, reflecting stabilized claim experience in our Life book of business and sequential improvement in disability results as the claim process modifications we made earlier this year continue to mature. Additionally, we completed our annual Disability reserve review in the third quarter. And consistent with our commentary last quarter, this review had de minimis impact on results. Overall, our third quarter results reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from our Commercial Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses and an improvement in our Group Disability and Life results with some elevated cost in our Government business. We also continue to generate very strong free cash flow from our businesses and have significant financial flexibility. Now, I will discuss our outlook for 2016. We continue to expect consolidated revenues to grow in the mid-single digit percentage range over 2015 results. Our outlook for full year 2016 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $2.025 billion to $2.095 billion, or $7.80 to $8.05 per share. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of $1.84 billion to $1.87 billion. This reflects continued strong performance in our Commercial Health Care business offset by a reduction of $60 million from previous expectations in our Government business due to higher than previously anticipated costs associated with our CMS audit response as well as loss ratio pressure in our Medicaid business. The assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2016 include the following. Regarding Global Medical customers, we continue to expect growth in the low-single-digit percentage range in 2016. Turning to medical costs, for our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we now expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 4% to 5%, a 50 basis point improvement over our previous expectations. We continue to deliver medical costs that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization. Now, turning to our medical care ratio outlook. For our total Commercial book of business, we continue to expect the 2016 MCR to be in the range of 78.5% to 79.5%, reflecting continued strong performance in our Commercial Employer business. Consistent with past years, our outlook anticipates a sequentially higher fourth quarter MCR due to an increase seasonal impact from the growing share of high deductible plans in our Employer group and Individual businesses. For our total Government book of business, we now expect the 2016 MCR to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5%, reflecting some pressure in our Medicaid offerings in Texas and Illinois. Regarding operating expenses, we continue to expect our 2016 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 21% to 22%, which continues to include the impact of spending on our CMS audit response. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth and now expect earnings in the range of $275 million to $285 million, an increase over our previous outlook. Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we now expect full year 2016 earnings in the range of $80 million to $110 million. This also represents an increase in our earnings expectations for Group. Regarding our remaining operations, that is Other Operations and Corporate, we now expect a loss of $170 million for 2016. So, all in, for full year 2016, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.025 billion to $2.095 billion or $7.80 to $8.05 per share. I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior-year reserve development or any future capital deployment. Regarding free cash flow, year to date, we have repurchased 785,000 shares of common stock for $110 million. We ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $2.2 billion. After considering all sources and uses of parent company funds, we expect to have approximately $2.75 billion in parent cash available during the balance of the year, including $250 million held for liquidity purposes. Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook remain strong. Now, to recap. We continued to invest in capabilities and programs across our businesses, which will deliver significant growth opportunities into the future. Our third quarter 2016 results reflect strength in our diversified portfolio of global businesses marked by continued positive momentum in our Employer business, Commercial Employer and Global Supplemental Benefits business as well as improvement in our Group Disability and Life business. In our Government business, the increased investments that we are making with regard to our audit response ensure that we are well-positioned for long-term growth. Overall, we are confident in our ability to achieve our full year 2016 earnings outlook and are well-positioned for attractive earnings growth in 2017. With that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Our first question comes from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Good morning. I was hoping you could give us some more detail on how you're doing with the Group Insurance business. Obviously, the earnings came in better than we were expecting for this quarter. What should we expect \u2013 realizing you've given us a range, what should we expect directionally for the fourth quarter and going into 2017? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Good morning. It's David. Just by way of direction, first, we're pleased with the improvement and performance in the third quarter. As we indicated previously, we expect the improvements to continue to be driven throughout the third quarter, fourth quarter and into 2017. There's always some variability in it, hence the range for the business outlook for the full year, but our expectation is throughout 2017, we'd see continued improvement and stabilization in our Disability business and putting us in the right step-up position as we look to 2018. Adding to that, as we look to 2017, we would expect stable and consistent Life results. And I'd note that we saw an appropriate step up in those results in the third quarter. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So, results so far on the Life side would confirm your earlier view that it was a once every decade or several years' fluctuation rather than something systemic? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Matthew, as you recall from the second quarter call, we indicated that the really significant spike took place quite early in the second quarter. And we even saw a reversion back toward the latter part of the second quarter. That pattern continued through the third quarter. We're pleased with our Life results and expect that to continue as we look forward. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And would you say \u2013 at this point, would you think that this \u2013 in terms of getting back to the \u2013 can you get back to the margin that you were at in the 2013 to 2015 time period for your Group Insurance business overall by the time you get to 2018? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Matthew, clearly, we're not giving you 2018 guidance, but first, by way of backdrop, the Disability portion of this business is a very strong and well-performing business that focuses on productivity solutions for employers. At this point, we fully expect that as we fully mature this model, we will be able to get back to our sustained margin goals. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Let me just ask one question on a different topic, which is as you look ahead to next year, on Medicare and the Star score results, what odds do you think you'll have of either getting CMS to maybe rethink the approach that they'd taken on the Star scores for impacting you in 2018 versus what you can do whether it's cross-walking or rather activities to offset that? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Matthew, I actually compliment your efficiency getting in so many questions. Relative to the Stars Rating, by way of backdrop, we're pleased and proud with the position we've developed for ourselves. 2016, 60% of our lives were four STAR+PLUS. 2017, 75%. Per your comment, the current view is that the Stars Rating would step down for 2018, specifically because of the audit process. To be quite clear here, we do not agree with those conclusions, nor do we accept those. In fact, our clinical and service measures reinforce a very positive outcome for the benefit of our seniors and our physician partners. And we're going to use a variety of approaches to resolve that issue, because again, we don't accept that outcome. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. You may ask your question. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Hello, everybody. First, a detailed question and a follow-up. The $60 million of headwind around the government business, I know part of it's audit cost and part of it sounds like it's this Medicaid issue. I think, last quarter, you said the audit costs were about $30 million. Were they similar in this quarter? And can you expand a little bit on the Medicaid issue? Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.: Sure, A.J. So, your recollection from last quarter is right, and I'd say the cost in this quarter were little higher than that. And if we look at the $60 million, which was the change in expectation for the full year, I'd split that about 50-50 between Medicaid and additional remediation costs. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Any color on what's happening in Medicaid? Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.: Oh, sure. So, first, again, let's put it in context. Medicaid is a small business for us, essentially just the dual SNP programs in Texas and the dual demonstration project in Illinois. And we did report an increased MCR in both Texas and Illinois this quarter. Different dynamics in each market. Texas included pressure from the long-term support service costs. In Illinois, we're seeing some rate pressure and more significant mix of higher-acuity patients than we'd expected. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And maybe my follow up to stay sort of in the government area. it's been a while since we had a company have to go through the Open Enrollment under sanctions. Can you just remind us on the ground what can you do to retain your membership and keep others from going after that? And when we get through the end of Open Enrollment, when you're thinking about 2017, is whatever enrollment you end up with, is that where you think you'll be for the year? I mean I guess, that entails when you think you might get resolution on the sanctions as well, but any thoughts on that would be helpful. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: A.J., good morning. Relative to your framing of your question. First, by way of backdrop, you're correct. Our working assumption is that we will not be participating in the Open Enrollment period. Specific to the actions, I'm not going to delineate the specific actions you can or cannot take. There's clear rules in terms of what you can do, in terms of what's the marketing versus retention activities. I think the most important thing to highlight is within our model, you'll recall that our model is largely based where the majority of our lives are in terms of very mature physician collaborative models, hence those customers or members have very deep relationships with those physician groups. That is a highly retentive tool. Not perfect, but it's a highly retentive tool, because there's deep relationships that have been built, there's expanded services and the like. So, while we expect attrition, and as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're planning for a revenue headwind in 2017 that will be offset by the attrition of the remediation costs. We expect retention to perform better than the historical norms of a sanctioned environment. As it relates to 2017, as soon as we're off sanctions, we'll be back in the monthly enrollment process, and we look forward to that environment. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. All right then. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Just want to start on the comments around 2017 being attractive financially and maybe juxtapose that with the 10% to 13% long-term growth. Is that attractive, meaning you expect to be within that range? And then what base should we be using for 2016? Maybe if Tom could give us sort of a run rate 2016 once we take out all the remediation costs that are extra, and any favorable development, or negative development as well, and maybe the Life and Disability side. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Josh, good morning. It's David. Let me give you just a little bit more color in terms of the drivers, as we think about moving from 2016 to 2017. And I appreciate your reframing our long-term commitment of the 10% to 13% on average, which we've delivered on average over the last half a dozen years. Specifically, we see three. We call it the three largest, meaningful tailwinds that are specific and compelling. Number one is the continued leverage of our well performing businesses, specifically our U.S. Employer Health Care business, and our Global Individual business, where we expect to continue to deliver attractive both revenue and earnings growth. Second is a meaningful step up in the margin performance of the Group Disability and Life business. And third is margin expansion in the Government business, where, largely, the attrition of the cost profile that we've incurred this year, which was significant will more than offset the revenue headwind. It's important to attach on top of that, that's going to take place under one or two environments : will either be in a so called Plan A, where we're able to effectuate the combination and we're stepping into a different environment; or a so-called Plan B, where the government will stop and impede us in terms of the ability to combine. In a Plan B scenario, our estimate is towards the latter part of 2017, we'll have between $7 billion and $14 billion of deployable capital, which is made up of about $5 billion of free cash at the latter part of 2017, leverage that we could step up to one threshold if we're going to use it solely for internal purposes, dividend buy back and the like. And the higher end of the range is if we're going to use leverage largely to expand our self through M&A capacity. So, taken as a whole, a significant uptick. I don't think it's constructive on this call to try to scroll the numbers around on the underlying run rate. Suffice to say 2016 is a choppy year for us, 2017 will be quite attractive. And if we expect to deliver certain numbers on average since this year is not an average year from a transition, we'd expect to have a very strong performance for 2017. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I'm sorry, David, is there a way to just parse that, maybe you don't have to give what you think the run rate, but just any extraordinary numbers this year? You're talking about the remediation costs. Obviously, that's a \u2013 I don't know if that's $70 million or so, or any way to just size the one-timers at least? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Let me give you two chunks to try to be helpful here. Chunk one will go to the remediation cost. Our best estimate for the full year is approximately $100 million after-tax. So, when we talk significant, it's significant because our objective is to effectively and rapidly \u2013 and speed is always in the eyes of the beholder, but effectively and rapidly resolve this and use whatever resource is necessary to put this behind us. So, think about $100 million after-tax, which is significant. Secondly, you know us quite well. And you know even with the revised outlook for our Group Disability and Life business, the earnings dislocation there is significant. And if you will just project forward a mindset that our view is a stable and consistent performance of the Life business, that's a meaningful step up. And then continued improvement in the Disability business. There's a significant step up, or an example to your point of a one-time dislocation, when you would compare 2016 to 2017, albeit, we don't expect to be at full earnings potential in 2017 because Disability will ramp throughout the course of the year. Those are two items I'd ask you to focus on. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning. First question, just to kind of tie out the whole CMS audit stuff. I wanted to ask, at what point do you think the work's going to be complete here, David? And then for \u2013 you put that $100 million number out there for the year. Is there any of it that you think remains in 2017, or does it all go away? And then you talked about being better than average. And I went back to Aetna and Health Net when they were out of the market, and I think they lost about 20% of their membership during Open Enrollment, while they were on sanction. Is that the bogie you're comparing yourself to when you're saying you're going to be better than average? And any kind of way that would give us directionality on that would be great. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Yeah. Justin, a few different comments there. First, by way of context. So, this is obviously a complex undertaking. And as I noted, as the $100 million reinforces, it's complex in terms of what we're confronting here. We confronted an audit process that was changed and modernized for CMS, so a new audit methodology. We operate a business model that functions off the more modern collaborative or value-based environment. And what that means is we have a lot of partners. Think about entities that we work with in partnership to get that value-based environment, and think about the better part of a couple hundred. So, the ability to operate in this more modernized audit environment relative to that, which we believe is a big part of what the future of health care looks like required us to drive some changes. We're driving those changes, and we'll seek to get those resolved in short order. So, we think we're in the latter phases, point one. Two, we believe the large majority of those costs will not be re-occurring, that otherwise will be contributors to 2017's earnings or the margin inflection. And third, we fully expect our retention levels to outperform the numbers that you referenced, largely based on the different orientation we have of our model. And we could look back and look at the retentive nature of our business over a long period of time and those relationships. So, while we expect a revenue headwind that will be meaningful, our revenue headwind projection is not in line with the numbers you made reference to. And we think it's largely driven by the different model we have, whereby once our customers are with us a year or more, they tend to be with us for a long, long time, largely because of those collaborative relationships. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. And then just a quick follow-up on the Health Care earnings. I understand, obviously, there are some headwinds and tailwinds going into next year on the Medicare side, but the increase in the remediation costs, I mean, basically, you took down Health Care by $60 million. I'm curious when you \u2013 we normally think about your Health Care business as a mid-to-high single-digit grower. Would it be reasonable to think that you'd grow in that capacity off of the original guidance, given that Medicaid and the CMS audit increases would seem to be transitory, or should we think about that growth coming off the new $1.840 billion to $1.870 billion guidance? Thanks. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Justin, we're not providing the detailed guidance for 2017. We look forward to doing that on our year-end call. But I think there's two important points you teased out. One, noted in my prepared comments, we continue to feel quite good about our Employer Health Care business, and that Employer Health Care business has continued to perform well as the marketplace looks for more engagement, more affordability solutions, more partnership solutions. And we would expect to see continued strong performance relative to our top line as well as our bottom line. And I'd ask you to think about our historical performance there. And I think you made reference to that. If you extract out the Government portion of the business, that's been lumpy beyond a shadow of a doubt. And we expect to see a step up in earnings next year, so I'd ask you to pull those two pieces apart as you think about your 2017. Clearly, we'll provide guidance at the end of the year as we go into our fourth quarter call. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks. Just a couple of questions. One, on the same topic, just the progression of the Global Health Care earnings through the year. I just want to make sure I understand. So, if we look at the first quarter, net income in the segment, up about $100 million. 2Q was down $42 million. Third quarter is down $66 million. The issues you've cited through the year have been individual market, Medicaid, the MA audit costs. But then as I look to the fourth quarter, it looks like you're looking for flat to plus $30 million year-over-year. So, just trying to understand that piece, why does it improve in the 4Q on a trend basis? Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.: Gary, a couple of things. First, you've cited the quarter-over-quarter variance in the third quarter. And you've got that right. And that's largely driven by the Medicaid and remediation costs. As we look to the fourth quarter, again the remediation costs we expect to moderate. The fundamentals in the fourth quarter kind of continue to be the same, very strong underlying Employer business, really not much news on the Individual side, a little bit of timing difference in the Group Disability and Life and Global Sub business. But that's generally the picture for the balance of the year. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Second question, just going back to Disability for a moment, David. I think when you had the issue in the 2Q, you were very clear that in the Disability claims you're not having a frequency issue. It's primarily a duration of claims issue caused by the disruption. So, as we look at this nice sequential improvement, is that where we'd be looking to that claims duration has improved sequentially? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Gary, appreciate the framing. Two dimensions here, so we're at the same convention. There's claims that are presented, there's validated claims, we call those occurrences or open claims, and then there's closed claims. So, point one is throughout the course of the year, we have not seen a different pattern. Again, we have not seen a different pattern of the volume of claims that present themselves for consideration. So, that's, I think, your first point. As we changed our model, we saw more claims go from that first bucket of potential claims to activated claims, open claims, because of the disruption of our process. So, that's disruption point number one. Disruption point number two is more claims stayed open or active for an elongated period of time because of the disruption. If I understand your question, if you think about the third quarter, we're seeing, again, no change in the number that are presenting themselves for consideration but improvement in that bucket two and bucket three, which are validated claims that are opened, and the rate and pace in which claims are closed. And we expect over time that pattern to continue. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Perfect. Thank you Operator : Thank you Mr. Taylor. Our next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen. You may ask your question. Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, there. With respect to the Medicare Advantage book, was the MLR elevated there at all? And as we go through Open Enrollment and experience some attrition, should we expect any impact on the MLR owing to the sanctions, or is it just a revenue issue? Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.: Christine, it's Tom. So, I would answer your last question first. I would expect the impact from sanctions will largely be in revenue. The position engagement model in HealthSpring continues to deliver strong medical costs consistently throughout the year. On a year-to-date basis the Medicare results are about flat MCR-wise, which again reflects that consistent strong performance as we commented on last time. Last time, there's a little bit of a higher MCR in some of the expansion markets, some of the less engaged markets, but generally consistent with our expectations for the year. Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: And it sounds like the improvement from second to third quarter in D&L was \u2013 both Life and Disability. Is there any way to parse out how much we saw improvement in Life versus Disability and \u2013 so, we can get a sense for how much more Disability is going to drive improvement or \u2013 and have we maximized our Life experience? Are we back to normal there? Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.: Well \u2013 look, again, last quarter, we highlighted we had significant variability in Life, so obviously more of the improvement sequentially has come from Life just getting back to normal, and in fact that kind of is the headline. Life business, back to normal expectations, Disability improving. Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you Ms. Arnold. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Sure. I want to go back to the headwinds and tailwinds for 2017. I guess, you didn't mention Medicaid improvement as a tailwind to 2017, so does that mean that you're not expecting improvement there? And then as far as the headwind, I think the only headwind I heard you mention was MA membership attrition. Is that really kind of the only meaningful headwind that you expect for 2017? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Kevin, good morning. It's David. You're correct. There's a variety of items, we didn't mention. So, there's always some smaller puts and takes. What we tried to call out were the three compelling major drivers. So, there's going to be other small puts and takes. And you should expect that if we're underperforming in Medicaid, we'd expect to take actions to slightly improve that as we move forward. But it's a small portion of our business, and in the scope of the moving parts that we talked about, those are the three items I'd ask you to consider relative to the fundamentals, with the fourth being the just tremendous capital deployment opportunity that sits in front of us. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. But it sounded like you said that the Medicaid was half of the government issue in the quarter and that you took down Health Care by $60 million, so it's not right to think that Medicaid was a $30 million drag? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Relative to the current year, we're feeling the pressure relative to the Medicaid number. All the other fundamentals are holding. If you look at the year to date, our Medicare number, as Tom noted, is performing cleanly year-over-year in totality with some puts and takes. Our PDP results improved somewhat. Our Medicaid results eroded somewhat. As we project forward to next year, again, we would expect to take actions to improve the Medicaid numbers, but the size of that delta in a well over $2 billion after-tax earnings franchise, what we're trying to call out here, these are the three discrete drivers that are most significant. There'll be some other puts and takes, absolutely. And you're correct, we would expect to improve that result as well. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And I guess my last question on your bids for next year, for MA, with the HIPAA expiring and also with the sanction, you get a lot of moving parts as to how you'd want to do this. It sounds like you're saying margin improvement in MA is driven more by the CMS sanction costs winding down rather than material MLR improvement. Wasn't sure how you \u2013 did you bid for margin? Did you bid kind of assuming a stable margin for next year? What were your thoughts there going into next year? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: With an eye toward 2017, obviously, when we had to put the bids in, we understood the environment we were in. We were already through the audit process. So, we knew the sanctions, et cetera. If you look back historically, we typically positioned ourself for more stable offerings, consistent benefits. As I referenced before, long-term customer relationships are an important part of our model, because it facilitates the interaction back and forth through the value-based offerings. Clearly, we sought to improve margins in some of the markets that were underperforming. With a portfolio our size, there's always opportunities in some select markets to improve margins, but that's a market-by-market approach. So, think guiding force, stable benefits, stable offerings, the customer-first orientation, working with our physician collaboratives, looking at all the tools that are available to us especially in the markets that may be underperforming. Some of those are the less mature market, so we took some actions in some of the less mature markets, and we expect to see a little bit more disruption there, but margin improvement that would take place, but by and large, stable offerings. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fishbeck. Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. You may ask your question. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to the MA side. You talked about $100 million in costs coming back to you after sanctions are lifted. And you said that, that's going to be more than offset any losses in Enrollment. But back to the envelope, we're estimating that's about 15,000 lives and off your base, which suggests about a 3% drop, in Enrollment. When I look at the last couple of quarters, you've had sort of a 2% to 3% drop sequentially sort of outside of Open Enrollment. So, just want to see if I'm missing anything and just your comfort around those expectations. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Ralph, good morning. It's David. I'm not going to go through the moving parts at this point. We'll provide full 2017 guidance at the end of the year, as we go through our fourth quarter call. The three headlines here are as follows : One, we expect better than market retention, because we've typically delivered better than market retention levels from our customers specifically tied to the collaborative model. You could actually look at \u2013 to your point, you can look at our attrition rates throughout the course of the year as we've been able to manage the business. Point two is the remediation costs will essentially \u2013 the large majority of those costs will attrit next year, which will offset the earnings implication. Broad sweeping numbers, we expect to grow the franchise in aggregate revenue numbers because of the strength of the business, as I referenced before : the U.S. Commercial Employer business; the Global Supplemental Benefits business; our Specialty portfolio, et cetera. And that will more than offset the revenue implications here as well. Lastly, order of magnitude, you could think about $1 billion of revenue that unfortunately currently is low margin. We'll step the margin up, and that will more than offset the earnings implication from that as we look through the attrition, both the end-of-month attrition for this year as well as the Open Enrollment attrition for next year. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then just my follow up, just want to go into the Commercial MLR a little bit more. You mentioned taking down sort of cost trend. Maybe go through some of the components of what you're seeing as the drivers there and how that's impacting \u2013 or maybe how that impacted how you priced and thought about 2017. Thanks. Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.: Hi, Ralph. It's Tom. So, obviously, we're very pleased with the medical trend results. We're continuing to build on a competitively attractive record here. And since most of our commercial customers are in self-funded arrangements, they directly benefit from this well-managed trend. So, absent the components, the experience to-date generally shows all of our trend components in the low to mid-single digits, so were pretty happy with that results. As far as impact on pricing, our philosophy has typically and remains consistent to anticipate medical cost trend in our pricing. And effectively, we're seeing great results in delivering medical cost trend and a good trajectory for this business going forward. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. You may ask your question. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah, thanks. Good morning. So, again, following up on the Government loss ratio. This year, you had year-over-year compared to last year give or take maybe 150 basis points or so of deterioration. Can you par that, how much of that came from this Texas, Illinois duals issue versus the Medicare advantage deterioration or Part D deterioration? And then given that you've been under what \u2013 CMS now apparently has a new claims audit process, so next year as you look at recovery and the MA and some of the Part D piece of it on loss ratio, how much of that is recoverable, or is this kind of the new normal because of a more stringent claims audit process? Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.: Ana, it's Tom. Rather than getting into all the pieces here, let me give you the higher-level message. The quarter-over-quarter deterioration you mentioned, that 160 basis points, 170 basis points. That's all attributable to Medicaid and the difference in less favorable prior development this year compared to last year. So, I wouldn't be anticipating that we'd be seeking significant improvements in the Medicare Advantage loss ratio going into 2017. We'd expect to have significant \u2013 continued ongoing strong performance there. And as far as splitting the difference in the variance in the quarter it splits about 60/40. Medicaid, the more significant variance is about 40%. A little bit of minor puts and takes other than that, but about 40% related to the difference in prior year. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: And on the latter part of your question, I'd ask you not to think about an impact of the audit on the sustainable loss ratio. I think I heard you say the claim audit process having an impact on the loss ratio going forward. We do not expect any implication on the sustainable of the loss ratio there. We have operating expenses, which you referenced that we had to incur to make process changes, but there are not fundamental differences of our cost, or quality, or clinical performance measures in any way, shape, or form we need to worry about there. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And just going to the Individual side, you don't say much here. The Commercial book's performing very well. I'm estimating you have maybe $800 million to $1 billion or so in premiums. As you look at how sequentially your experience from 2Q to 3Q, what is that telling you about that book, even though it's small compared to your peers? And what does that mean for next year in relation to your bids? And I believe you've entered one more state at least. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Ana, two headlines there. Relative to 2Q to 3Q, essentially consistent, I think is the big picture headline relative to the individual book of business. Relative to next year, important to put a backdrop on it. As you recall, we have been, I'll say, cautious and slow in this space, is the headline. As we've viewed the opening of this marketplace in 2014 is probably being much smaller than projections, not profitable for the industry and choppy or less than stable operationally. And unfortunately, societally, it's proving to be more right than wrong. We entered five markets, and we deliberately and slowly grew to seven markets. As we look to 2017, our initial plan had us growing into 10 markets. After assessing all the market dynamics, we're going to end up in seven markets in 2017, but a different mix where we will shrink our footprint in three markets by leaving three markets on the exchange. And then we'll have a new offering in three different markets, specifically built on our collaborative model. So, some change in the overall profile of our marketplace but a smaller geographic footprint than we were anticipating; we anticipated going from seven to 10 markets. We're going to actually be in seven markets with a different mix, net-net taking it all as a whole. For next year, we're going to expect to see some revenue growth there. We're continuing to plan for a loss in the business, which is what we think is appropriate as we continue to refine our learnings and look to determine whether there's a sustainable future here. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Gupte. Our next question comes from Dave Windley, Jefferies. You may ask your question. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to pivot to a couple of questions on International. David, your International Risk business membership growth ticked up pretty nicely in the third quarter. Wondering if that's another bright spot in Global Health Care, and if there's anything in particular to call out there in the growth path of that business? And then over on Global Sup, I guess I'm just interested in kind of an update on the overall strategy and model. Is it basically unchanged and continuing to roll out in additional markets or countries, noting that Korea had an 18% growth in the quarter? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Dave, good morning. So, two headlines here. First, as we noted both through Tom's comments and my comments, continued strong performance of our Global business, that's headline number one. Two different businesses, big picture to think about. One is a largely an employer globally mobile business, where we take care of corporate expats, IGOs, NGOs, et cetera. And we've seen a bit of growth in there that we are pleased with and a bit of continuation of growth there that we're pleased with. That's part of our Global Employer business. And then the Global Supplemental or Global Individual business, where we continue to see strong growth anchored in our strongest market, which is Korea. You referenced a phraseology in terms of is there nothing changed? A pause on that one, because in a dynamic global market, everything's changing all the time. But the core of our business model remains, which is a focus for that business, the Supplemental business, a focus on the individual, understanding their needs, innovating derivative products and having distribution capabilities and unique ways to meet them on a direct fashion, be it telemarketing, be it direct pull-through Internet, be it TV, be it retail base, et cetera. That iterative evolution is what's driving our business growth as the global markets continue to evolve and the global middle class continues to grow. So, looking forward, as we noted, we expect this to continue to be a positive driver for us to 2017 and looking to the future. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Windley. Our next question comes from Chris Rigg, Susquehanna Financial Group. You may ask your question. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Just wanted to come back to Global Health Care income quickly here. I'm sorry to keep coming back to this, but, I guess, when we think about where you were when you reported second quarter results the end of July relative to what you're looking for now in terms of the remediation costs, I mean, it's a $30 million step up in a pretty short window of time. I guess, I'm just not fully understanding why it increased so rapidly relative to what you were looking for at mid-year. Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.: Well, Chris, it's Tom. Look, we've invested a lot in technology, augmenting staff and engaging consultants to get this done as quickly as possible. And the cost has been substantial. Total costs to-date are in the about $80 million range after tax. As David indicated, we're expecting about $100 million for the full year, so we see the costs have peaked in the third quarter. They have significantly ramped down in the fourth quarter, and that ramp down reflects a more narrowly-focused work effort as we just address the remaining issues. So, that's the general pattern of what's going on here. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And then just on the two Medicaid issues, I mean, Texas normally has a rate increase September 1, and I can't remember where Illinois stands, but nevertheless, do you think at least in Texas, the rate increase there gets you back to breakeven pretty quickly? And likewise, can you give us a sense for where things stand in Illinois? Thank you. Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.: Yeah. I'd say, in Texas while perhaps there'll be a rate increase that will help us, that's more impacting costs. In Illinois, we'd expect it to be more through rate increase. And we'd expect that to be closer to the beginning of the year. So, all in, again, this is a small business for us, so I think that on the margin, the impact is marginal, but all in, we'd expect to get some improvement in results here. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rigg. Our last question comes from Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI. You may ask your question. Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for getting me in there. On your decrease to cost trend guidance for the Commercial business, are there any particular utilization categories to call out that drove the decline there in terms of inpatient versus outpatient versus prescription? Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.: Yeah, again, we're pretty happy with the overall results here. I would call out, the driver of the change is largely pharmacy. So, in the pharmacy trend, we're seeing benefit both from the moderation in specialty drug costs and the continued strong performance of our integrated model. Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC : And then maybe just one more on Star Ratings and Medicare Advantage. Given the decline there for the 2018 payment year, what do you think your prospects are for improving those ratings for 2019? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Yeah, Michael. It's David. First, as I indicated previously on the call, we're pleased with the quality indicators, we're able to deliver. So, off a base of 60% for STAR+PLUS in 2016; 75% for STAR+PLUS in 2017. Absolutely not lost in us that the current view is to meaningfully downdraft us for 2018. We do not agree, and therefore do not accept that. Our outcome measures, both service satisfaction and retention, clinical outcomes, physician partnership members do not reinforce that. So, we have a variety of paths in front of us. We seek to address that for 2018 long before we look at 2019. Fundamentally, we would expect to be rewarded for and recognized for the strong performance we're able to deliver as we look to 2018 and 2019. Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Newshel. I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Thanks, everyone. So, to conclude our call this morning, I'd like to underscore just a few key points from our discussion. Cigna's third quarter results include meaningful revenue and earnings contributions from our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits business and improving financial performance in our Group Disability and Life segment. This gives us confidence that we will achieve our full year 2016 outlook and deliver attractive earnings and revenue growth in 2017. We are anticipating and meeting customer and client needs through innovation, engagement and value-based programs, which continue to drive our business performance. We have significant capital resources available for deployment. And our business remains well-positioned to deliver strong results for the benefit of shareholders over the long-term. And finally, we're fortunate to have a passionate and engaged workforce of over 40,000 colleagues around the globe, who are guided by our strategy to drive value for our customers, clients and shareholders each and every day. Again, we thank you for joining our call, and for your investment in Cigna. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's Third Quarter 2016 Results Review.

As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the call over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell. William McDowell - Cigna Corp.: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's full year 2016 financial results, as well as our financial outlook for 2017. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on this same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders' net income, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2017 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, I note that in the fourth quarter, we recorded two charges to shareholders' net income, which we reported as special items. The first special item was an after-tax charge of $80 million or $0.31 per share to establish a full allowance against risk corridor program receivables that were reported on Cigna's balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. While we continue to believe that the government has a binding obligation to pay issuers the full amount due for each year of the risk corridor program, we base this allowance on GAAP accounting requirements in light of recent events. Consistent with this assessment, we did not record any additional risk corridor receivables in fourth quarter 2016. The second special item was an after-tax charge of $39 million or $0.15 per share for merger-related transaction costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of financial results. Also, consistent with past practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior-year development of medical costs. And with that, I will turn the call over to David. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Thanks, Will. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. In today's call, I'll briefly review highlights from our 2016 financial results as we close the year with solid momentum. I'll then address how we are strategically positioning for the long-term success as we drive innovation and further strengthen our capabilities to deliver value for our customers, clients, partners and ultimately you, our shareholders, all while a variety of dynamic forces continue to evolve our markets. I'll also offer some thoughts on our expectations for 2017, which include strong momentum across our businesses, attractive ongoing free cash flow generation, and an exceptionally strong capital position, all of which provide opportunity for considerable value creation in 2017 as well as over the long-term. Tom will then address our fourth quarter and full year 2016 financial performance results in more detail as well as provide the specifics for our outlook for 2017 before we take your questions. After Q&A, I'll wrap up our call with a few closing remarks. Let's dive into some highlights for the full year. For 2016, consolidated revenues increased 5% to $39.7 billion, as we continue to focus on our mission to improve the health, well being and sense-of-security of the people we serve. We reported adjusted income from operations for 2016 of $2.1 billion, or $8.10 per share, reflecting strong performance in our Commercial employer and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses. As you know, we also focused on addressing challenges that emerged in the first half of the year in our historically well performing Group Disability and Life and Seniors businesses, where we drove notable progress in the second half of 2016. Specifically, within the second half, we gained traction in Group Disability and experienced a more stable claims environment in our Life book of business. Within our Seniors business, we made progress with our remediation efforts and are in the latter stages of the audit response work relative to the Medicare Advantage offerings. We are highly focused on emerging with an even stronger Seniors business and portfolio of solutions that is well-positioned for sustained growth. Overall, we delivered on our revised expectations for the full year of 2016 financial results and concluded the year with positive momentum as we enter 2017. Turning now to how we are effectively positioning our business for the future. In the United States, once again, we have a new administration advocating for health care reform and we expect the U.S. regulatory and legislative environment to be dynamic. That said, the core issues that have pressured health care markets more broadly and have recently challenged the U.S. Individual exchange marketplace in particular arise from the same market forces and pressures that pressure the status quo health care systems both in the United States as well as across the globe. More specifically, aging populations, eroding health status and the rise of chronic conditions all pose challenges for health care consumers individually as well as society at large. These forces in turn contribute to increasing demand for greater access to health care services and sense of security offerings that are both affordable and of high quality. Additionally, we see acceleration and demand for programs that offer more personalized solutions and are designed for local marketplaces. Our proven differentiated strategy of Go Deep, Go Global and Go Individual is directly responsive to these forces, and enables us to anticipate and address these needs. Our proven strategy is delivering value as we help the people we serve maintain and improve their health as well as access high-quality affordable care when needed. We enable this through a combination of solutions and partnerships to better connect individuals and health care professionals resulting in improved health and well-being and better value for our customers. For example, on the demand side, we're incentivizing, engaging and supporting the individuals we serve to drive healthy actions and behavior. On the supply side, we're deepening collaboration with health care professionals and supply chain partners with leading-edge strategic alliances, incentive programs and value-based arrangements as well as effective information sharing and targeted point-of-care resources. Importantly, these efforts are resulting in greater rewards for higher-performing health care providers and better value for our customers. With an eye toward delivering sustained value, we've also continued to invest in innovative tools and capabilities over the past few years in order to better anticipate and meet the emerging needs of customers, clients and health care partners. Now I'd like to briefly highlight a few examples of new innovative solutions we're delivering in the marketplace. We recently launched a set of powerful solutions that exemplify our approach in bringing personalized, affordable and integrated solutions to the local markets. On the demand side, starting with the needs of our customers, this year more than 1 million Cigna customers have access to One Guide, a multi-modal service experience powered by analytics that proactively engage consumers to stay healthy, eliminate surprises and save money. One Guide combines the convenience of a smart integrated digital app with the expertise and empathy of human touch. This differentiated solution provides access to guided consultation via the phone, web, mobile app or chat. We are driving stronger customer engagement in health outcomes by harnessing predictive analytics, the customer insights to deliver real-time notifications to our customers and our customer service representatives in an omni-channel environment. This highly personalized and specific data empowers the individual at the right moment as it is tailored to their health status and engagement preferences. Together, these capabilities help our customers make informed decisions, reduce health expenses and further strengthen their connection with their doctors. We're also driving enhancements in affordability and quality on the supply side with continued investments in value-based care. Today, we have nearly 250 collaborative arrangements across large physician and specialty practices spanning 31 states. We also partner in incentive payment models with a growing number of hospital systems and are forming partnerships in the form of delivery system alliances. These value-based arrangements, including the one we most recently announced in California last month, will enable greater emphasis on preventative care and improved quality and value by closely aligning clinical teams including nurse care coordinators, case managers and health coaches, and further integrating them in the health care delivery system to create a more seamless experience for our customers and a more coordinated health care system. A final example, which brings the demand and supply side together and demonstrates how we are innovating for our customers, clients and provider partners, is the recent launch of Cigna's SureFit solution. This innovative new solution heightens collaboration between local physician networks and hospital groups to help drive efficiency and create a more personalized experience for our customers. This program empowers customers to create an optimized network configuration and benefit design to best meet their own personalized needs. Our clients receive substantial savings, thanks to the lower total cost of care as well as embedded behavioral, pharmacy and population health solutions that are fully integrated into our offerings. All this is coupled with a higher level of personalization and customer support that is enabling an easier, more efficient administrative experience for our customers. Each of these solutions demonstrates the best value comes from engaging, incentivizing and supporting individuals, incenting and enabling healthcare professionals with shared resources and value-based rewards, all delivered through highly localized, integrated solutions. Now as we step into 2017, we expect to deliver continued value for our customers and clients and, as a result, our shareholders. Within our Global Health Care segment, we expect to grow in the range of 300,000 to 500,000 total medical customers for the year. This will be driven by strong retention and customer growth in each of our employer segments; more specifically, national accounts, middle-market, select and international, as well as an increase of 100,000 customers in our U.S. Individual customer base. This will be offset somewhat by an expected reduction in the number of senior segment customers by 50,000 in 2017. Overall, we see an attractive year ahead. Our outlook implies an 11% to 17% EPS growth rate which does not include the impact of any capital deployment. Tom will provide more specifics on our guidance in a few moments. Our outlook for an attractive 2017 is further strengthened by our current capital position. As you know, we view capital management as an important priority and responsibility for our shareholders. In total, depending on the mix of share repurchase, dividends and M&A, we would expect to have between $7 billion to $14 billion of deployable capital in 2017. It's important to emphasize here that we have a disciplined approach and a strong track record of deploying capital and avoid having surplus capital sit idle for any length of time. Looking broadly ahead, it is also important to remind you that we remain committed to achieving our long-term EPS growth rate of 10% to 13% on average through a combination of strong organic earnings growth and capital deployment opportunities. Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to emphasize a few important points from my comments. We concluded 2016 with momentum, driven by strong results in our Commercial Healthcare business and Global Supplemental Benefits business, as well as improving results in our Group Disability and Life segment. Our well-positioned, diverse growing portfolio of businesses is delivering innovative solutions that meet the needs of markets around the world. Our talented global team is excited to step into 2017, poised for attractive growth and the opportunity for significant value creation for our customers, clients and you, our shareholders. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom. Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.: Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will briefly review Cigna's 2016 results and provide our outlook for 2017. Key financial highlights in the year are consolidated revenue growth of 5%, earnings per share of $8.10 and continued strong free cash flow, ending the year with approximately $2.75 billion of parent company cash. Our ability to grow revenues, deliver continued strong earnings in our Commercial Healthcare and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses and address the challenges in Seniors and Group Disability and Life reflects the underlying strength of our franchise. Regarding our segments, I will first comment on Global Health Care. 2016 premiums and fees grew 3% to $27.7 billion. We ended 2016 with 15.2 million global medical customers, growing by approximately 200,000 customers. Full-year earnings were $1.85 billion, reflecting strong performance in our Commercial employer business driven by customer growth, strong specialty results and favorable medical cost outcomes. Partially offsetting these strong Commercial results were elevated costs in our Government business. Our results also reflect the impact of not recording $15 million after-tax of additional risk corridor receivables we had anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2016. Regarding risk corridor receivables, we continue to believe that the government has a binding obligation to pay issuers the full amount for each year of the risk corridor program. Nevertheless, in light of the large program deficits announced by CMS in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a recent unfavorable court decision, based on GAAP accounting, we recorded an allowance against the full amount of our risk corridor balance in the fourth quarter of 2016. Turning to medical costs, we continued to deliver medical costs that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization of care. For our total U.S. Commercial book of business, full year medical cost trend for 2016 was modestly below the low end of our previous guidance range of 4% to 5%. Our Commercial medical trend result once again reflect industry-leading performance building on our multi-year track record of providing our clients with direct benefits from these favorable medical costs given that over 85% of our U.S. Commercial customers are in transparent ASO funding arrangements. The Total Commercial medical care ratio of 79.3% for the full year 2016 reflects the ongoing strong performance of our Commercial employer business as well as continued high medical costs in our U.S. Individual business. The Total Government medical care ratio of 85.3% for the full year 2016 reflect solid performance in our Medicare Advantage business and increased medical cost in our Medicaid business. The Global Health Care operating expense ratio of 21.5% for the full year 2016 reflects approximately $100 million in after-tax costs related to our CMS audit response as well as continued investments in strategic initiatives offset by continued efficiency gains. Overall, we had another strong year in health care, particularly in our Commercial employer business. Turning to our Global Supplemental Benefits business, premiums and fees grew 7% year-over-year or 10% on a currency adjusted basis. Earnings of $294 million represented an increase of 12% year-over-year or 15% on a currency adjusted basis, reflecting business growth and continued operating expense discipline. For Group Disability and Life, full year results reflect premium and fee growth of 4% over 2015. Full-year earnings in our Group business were $125 million, with fourth quarter earnings of $69 million. These fourth quarter 2016 earnings reflect continued stabilization of claim experience in our Life book of business, underlying sequential improvement in Disability results as the claim process modifications made earlier in 2016 continued to mature as well as some favorability from taxes and investment income in the quarter. Overall, we ended 2016 with continued strong revenue and earnings contributions from our Commercial Healthcare and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses and a clear path to addressing the challenges reflected in Seniors and Group Disability and Life. We also continue to generate strong free cash flow across our enterprise and have significant financial flexibility. Now I will discuss our outlook for 2017. As David discussed, we continue to introduce innovative solutions into the marketplace that enhance our existing portfolio of businesses to drive strong value for our customers and clients. As a result, in 2017 we expect to deliver attractive financial growth for our shareholders by driving continued strong results from our well performing Commercial Healthcare and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses, and meaningfully improving the performance of our Seniors and Group Disability and Life businesses. For full year 2017, we expect consolidated revenues to grow in the range of 2% to 3% over 2016, driven by continued growth across our targeted market segments other than Seniors, where we expect revenue to decline due to the CMS enrollment sanctions. We expect full year 2017 consolidated adjusted income from operations to grow in the range of 12% to 18% to $2.35 billion to $2.48 billion, or $9 to $9.50 per share. Consistent with prior practice, our outlook excludes any contribution from future capital deployment as well as prior-year claim development. I will now discuss the components of our 2017 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $2.035 billion to $2.115 billion. This outlook reflects strength in our Commercial business driven by continued benefits from organic customer growth, specialty contributions and effective medical cost management as well as improved results in Seniors, including the absence of the large majority of the $100 million after-tax in costs associated with the CMS audit response incurred in 2016. The assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2017 include the following. Regarding total medical customers, we expect 2017 growth in the range of 300,000 to 500,000 customers. Turning to medical costs, for our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we expect full year 2017 medical cost trend to be in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%. For our Total Commercial book of business, we expect the 2017 medical care ratio to be in the range of 80.5% to 81.5%. This compares to a full year 2016 Commercial MCR of 79.3% and reflects a 150 basis point increase from the impact on premium from the waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017. For our Total Government book of business, we expect the 2017 medical care ratio to be in the range of 85% to 86%, generally consistent with the 2016 result. Regarding operating expenses, we expect our 2017 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 20.5% to 21.5%, reflecting the absence of the health insurance tax in 2017, impacts from the CMS audit, and increased strategic investments. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we expect earnings in the range of $295 million to $315 million, reflecting business growth partially offset by the impact of foreign currency movements. Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we expect continued improvement of Disability operational performance through 2017, resulting in full year 2017 earnings in the range of $200 million to $230 million. Regarding our remaining operations, that is Other Operations & Corporate, we expect a loss of $180 million for 2017. So all-in, for full year 2017, we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.35 billion to $2.48 billion, or $9 to $9.50 per share. I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of prior-year reserve development or any future capital deployment. Overall, these results represent a competitively attractive outlook and underscore the benefits of our diverse and differentiated portfolio of businesses. Now moving to our 2017 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have excellent financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well-capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent with a strong return on capital in each of our business segments. Our capital deployment strategy and priorities remain providing the capital necessary to support growth of our ongoing operations, pursuing M&A activity with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow in our targeted areas of focus, and after considering these first two items, we've returned capital to shareholders primarily through share repurchase. Regarding free cash flow, during 2016 we repurchased 785,000 shares of common stock for approximately $110 million, and we ended the year with parent company cash of approximately $2.75 billion, including $250 million held for liquidity purposes. After considering all sources and uses of parent company funds, we expect to have over $5 billion in parent cash available by the end of 2017. Further, we will have the ability to enhance the amount of capital available for deployment through increased financial leverage, resulting in a total of $7 billion to $14 billion available for capital deployment by the end of 2017 depending on whether the capital will be used for share repurchase or M&A. Our free cash flow outlook reflects the industry-leading margins and returns of capital of our businesses. Now to recap, our full year 2016 results reflect the strength in our diversified portfolio of businesses marked by continued positive momentum in our Commercial Healthcare and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses, as well as ongoing improvements in Group Disability and Life. In our Government business, the increased investments we're making with regard to our audit response ensure that we are well-positioned for long-term growth. Overall, we are pleased with the momentum reflected in our fourth quarter results and are confident in our ability to achieve our full year 2017 outlook. With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Finally, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. However, you may place yourself back into the queue, should you have another question. One moment, please, for our first question. Our first question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning. A couple questions here. First, your recent communications on the Anthem deal appear to indicate that you might not agree that your partner here has the right to extend. I'm curious if you can give us some color on your recent comments via 8-K. And then I'm also curious if there's any reason in particular that you haven't given color on capital deployment on a Plan B scenario, given your partner in the deal has done so already. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Justin, good morning. It's David. Relative to your first question just briefly, obviously, we await the court's decision. And from a governance standpoint, we thought we took the appropriate step by issuing the K, and the language of the K is quite clear. Relative to your second question, what we thought was most important is to make sure that our investors understand the breadth of capital available for deployment. And our intention would be to create additional clarity in terms of the use of that to the extent there is a Plan B scenario that would be executed versus a consummation of the deal. So transparency relative to the tremendous capital that is, Tom and I both noted range between $7 billion and $14 billion. Stay tuned for more pending the insights relative to the court's decision. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And if I could just ask a question on Disability and Life. Obviously, the improvement we've seen is significant third and fourth quarter. I'm looking at your guidance and it doesn't appear to embed continued improvement through 2017, just given the run rate coming out of the back half of the year. I'm just curious if there's anything I'm missing there or is there some level of conservatism that we should think about Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.: Well, Justin, it's Tom. Let me start first with the quarter. And again, we're really pleased with the progress we have in improving results in Group Disability and Life. In the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, reflects stable life claim experience and continued improvement in Disability and Life results as those processes continue to mature. I also called out that the quarter did include some favorable impact from tax accruals and net investment income, and I'd size those at about $10 million. So if you look at our outlook, considering all that, it really reflects continued normalized life claim experience and a continued pattern of maturity in disability claims management over the balance of 2017. And it's an attractive growth over the results we posted in 2016. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : You still expect to exit the year at the typical margins in the Disability business, as you said before? Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.: Pretty close. I mean that's one of those things. We'll see as we get closer to the end of the year, but that's the glide path we'd like to be on. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you, Justin Lake. Our next question comes from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. I was hoping that you could comment on any observations you have on the enrollment that you've seen so far in the Individual segment and what your profitability expectations are as things evolve for the full-year 2017? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Matthew, it's David. First, let me give you a little bit of color relative to the positioning we took for 2017 and then try to provide you some color in terms of the enrollment. As you know from prior conversations, we viewed that the marketplace 2014, 2015 and 2016 specifically we call version 1.0. We viewed that it would be a relatively choppy ride in the implementation of all the new attributes of the program; that the marketplace in total would be smaller than projected and unprofitable overall. We chose to participate in that marketplace on a very focused basis, initially in five states, not expecting to make money but expecting to learn. And broadly speaking, those goals were achieved. Relative to 2017, as we were operating in 2016, our expectation was that we would move from \u2013 specifically from seven states in 2016 to 10 states in 2017. We assessed the markets and based on the formula we thought we needed to have to work in terms of benefit flexibility, but very importantly, network configuration with collaborative accountable care relationships that were acceptable to the state that we were going to operate in, we actually exited three states and entered three states resulting in seven states that we are in for 2017. The net result is we expect to grow as I noted by about 100,000 lives, those 100,000 lives will be highly biased toward our preferred offerings which are heavily oriented around the Collaborative Accountable Care relationships and the aligned models. Relative to initial measures and metrics, obviously we need to get through the quarter and see how the lives mature. You know that. As you get through the quarter, those lives will atrophy off a little bit in terms of the final manifestation of the lives we have. But they're generally in line with our initial expectations as we start the year. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And let me ask, how are you thinking at this point about the decision to continue or not continue on the exchanges in 2018? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Matthew, important point. Again, we assess the market year-in, year-out, and as I noted, we made some very different moves in 2017 than we initially anticipated with those three exits versus just three entrances. We'll have a lot of decisions to make as we get through the spring of the year, and we'll assess our participation in the marketplace in totality with a fresh set of eyes based upon the rules, regulations and design for that marketplace that, as we sit here right now, is fragile at best. So we will fully assess whether we will participate, where, and how as we get through the spring cycle. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Matthew Borsch. Our next question comes from Joshua Raskin with Barclays. You may ask your question. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. I apologize for asking again, but just related to the 8-K, I think, David, you said that the language was clear. I guess the language to me intimated that there was a disagreement between whether or not the merger agreement could be extended. So, I guess, I'm just curious if maybe I'm not reading that right. And then with respect to capital deployment, would there be anything that would preclude you \u2013 I know Tom said that there's a bias towards returning capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks. Is there anything that would preclude you from an accelerated share repurchase program? Is there something specific on the M&A front that you want the financial flexibility for, or any color on that as well. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Josh, on your first point, again, we believe the language is quite clear and appropriate from a governance standpoint, and I would direct you back both to that language and if you so choose, the contract, which is filed and public. Specifically from the capital deployment standpoint, as Tom noted, we have excellent flexibility, and I think that's the right way of attributing it. To the extent we do not have a transaction to finalize here, we will aggressively evaluate and conclude upon all options that are available to us from a capital deployment standpoint. But there are no impediments that we see relative to capital deployment, and all alternatives are available to us. And we would intend to create high visibility if we're in that environment as promptly as possible. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got you. And then just on the 300,000 to 500,000 additional lives, I know Senior down 500,000 and then Individual up 100,000, but maybe a little bit more color on that? And just specifically, is the Senior down 500,000 to start? We saw that in January, or is that where we're going to get to at the end of the year? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Josh, important you picked up the 5 correctly, but it's 50,000. So stepping back, the growth was \u2013 is projected to be 300,000 to 500,000, so that's where you're ramping against the 500,000 number in terms of cumulative growth of lives. That growth is driven by very strong performance in all of our employer segments; national, middle, select, international, driven by strong retention, good expansion of relationships as well as targeting new business adds where our engagement in incentive-based programs, our collaboratives, our alternative funding and our sustained strong track record of low medical cost trend is indeed paying off. Specific to your question on Seniors, again, we project for 2017 for the year to have a net reduction of 50,000 lives or about 10% of the starting point as a result of not being in the active open enrollment period. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Joshua Raskin. Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. You may ask your question. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Hello, everybody. Maybe I'll just ask you about the medical cost trend commentary. Obviously, another very good year for you guys, coming in below 4%. I think that's industry-leading. It sounds like on the guidance though, you're assuming that steps up to 4.5% to 5.5%, and I'm wondering what's behind that. And I know specifically, you're calling out the favorable variance that got you below 4% in 2016 was related to pharmacy costs. I'm trying to understand is that sort of a one-time step maybe because of some of the contract renegotiations you had, or is there something that continues into 2017 related to that? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: A.J., it's David. Let me start. Just big-picture, we're very pleased and proud to have multiple years of posting very low medical cost trend relative to industry norms. And as you noted, we ended the full year 2016 a bit below our outlook of 4% to 5%. I'd remind you we started 2016 with an outlook of 4.5% to 5.5%, but in 2016, we lowered that by about 50 basis points. So the way we think about it is for 2017, we're planning at the same level that we planned at for 2016. We planned at 2016 at 4.5% to 5.5%. We're planning 2017 at 4.5% to 5.5%. Admittedly, it's a tick up from where we ended 2016, a modest uptick. We're viewing in terms of in our projection some uptick in utilization, some uptick in pharmacy, but no macro driver to call out that is changing the inflection point. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you, A.J. Rice. Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. I want to clarify something, and then ask my real question. David, I was just trying to keep up with you, and I think the new states on the individual markets you're entering are North Carolina, Illinois and Virginia. And in response to why you entered those new markets, I heard needed benefit flexibility, network configuration and collaborative ACO arrangements acceptable to states, and none of that really, I guess, explains to me why you entered three new states. So if you could maybe try again and help us understand that? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Sure. I apologize if I wasn't clear before. So our learnings to-date, if we step back, we've participated in this market since its inception keeping our revenue in the 2%, 3%, maybe 4% range. We've expected each of the years that we would lose money. We keep that in a manageable corridor and we sought to try to learn in terms of what are the successful recipes here to deliver the right value for customers and create a sustainable solution to be able to do so with health care partners as well as for our shareholders. Our conclusion is within the current rule set, the only viable way to make this work is to have a well-coordinated, highly aligned, value-based care arrangement with the health care professionals that is the underbelly or foundation of the offering. Additionally, we've been able to successfully expand relationships with our Collaborative Accountable Care partners or delivery system alliances being physician groups or hospitals across multiple lines of business; Commercial, Medicare Advantage, Commercial Individual, et cetera. So in these three markets that you identified, we both had market conditions in terms of benefit alignment as well as delivery system partners that we were able to put together and believe in our chosen geographies \u2013 very importantly, not state-wide \u2013 in our chosen targeted geographies around those delivery system alternatives, we have a good value proposition that we are proud to bring to market with our health care partners. That's what drove us into those specific markets. And you may think about those, Gary, as sub-markets within North Carolina, sub-markets within Illinois, et cetera, built around those collaborative relationships. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's great. That's helpful. And I think \u2013 I don't think you're assuming much in terms of profitability, but obviously ultimately you think you will be able to be profitable. That was my clarification. If you'll indulge me to ask my real question, I was going to go to Tom. Just on \u2013 one of the things you talked about on Commercial MLR was more normal stop loss experience and that 2015 was kind of unusually favorable. Can you just remind us or what have you learned about why 2015 was so good? And then the second part is, is there any different tale on the stop loss claims versus fully insured? Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.: So let me get the Commercial on the MCR first, Gary. Just again, our Commercial MCR we're really happy with; very consistent with our expectation, continued strong results in the Commercial Group business, a little bit of pressure from the high medical costs in Individual, but as expected. So I did call out in their quarter-over-quarter comparison that's a pretty large variance versus last year, about 270 basis points. About half of that is attributable directly to just the changed MCR in Individual. The balance is largely due, as you called out, to stop loss results. And that was, as I tried to make clear, very much related to last year being very favorable; this year being more normal. And if you look back over a number of years, you'll see that kind of pattern that last year was the outlier being unusually favorable. So results this year in stop loss very consistent with our expectation. Channeled payments, I mean that gets a little \u2013 I mean they both pay off relatively quickly in the scheme of things and reserving. There's a little different shape to it given the high frequency of low-dollar claims typical in the typical reserves, but I wouldn't call out any major league differences. We're not talking about a long-term buildup of reserves like we are in Disability. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Gary Taylor. Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open. Go ahead with your question. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Any comments or color on the MA rates released last night and impact to you specifically around Star bonus and sanctions at this point? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Ralph, it's David. Obviously as you referenced, came out last night. Our team is going through it rather thoroughly. I'd say a couple big-picture comments. The first, excluding the Stars implication, our view is that our rate implication is similar to that of the industry. Secondly, including the proposed reduction to our Stars in 2018, our revenue impact would be a bit lower than that of the industry or less positive than that of the industry. Third, as you know, we do not agree with or accept that Stars conclusion because we're of the view that our clinical outcomes, our service outcomes and our overall program outcomes are far superior than the conclusion that's being drawn. And in the current state, we're working with CMS literally as we speak to try to gain a shared understanding of the results we're delivering and arrive at a different outcome for 2018. But big picture overall, revenue impact to us, in line with the industry. Say for the proposed adjustment to our Stars, including that the revenue impact for us would be less. We're working with CMS directly on that. And to the extent we're not successful, we have a variety of other levers to be able to manage for 2018 that we would deal with down the road in terms of talking about our benefit positioning. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. All right, that's helpful. Thanks. And then just a follow-up question. Is there any way to frame penetration to specialty across your ASO book? Is the opportunity really more driven by new wins, or is there opportunity in the existing book? Thanks. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Let me just give you some color and then try to give you direction going forward. First, your basic rule of thumb I think should be that the higher the average case size historically for the industry, the lower the penetration rate. The lower the average case size, the higher the penetration rate. Second rule of thumb is, as you're dealing with consumer-directed offerings, you'll have a higher average penetration rate versus non-consumer-directed offerings, the case size being similar because the individual is the aggregator and you're trying to get an overall aggregated proposition. For us, we've continued to make very good progress relative to both penetrating, using I think your orientation, our multiple blocks of business whether it's in our existing relationships or new business relationships. We see tremendous ability to further grow our specialty profile, both in the existing portfolio as well as in our new business portfolio. And the final comment I would make is, our view is that the industry historically looked at this as an opportunity to cross sell, then moved in an environment of beginning to bundle and now is just exploring the way to truly integrate. And a lot of what we've been successful at is truly integrating the programs, be they clinical, service and outcome programs. So larger versus smaller, penetration rates move, consumer directed versus non-consumer directed, penetration rates move. For us, we have opportunity both in our captive book as well as in new business going forward and we're excited about that. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Ralph Giacobbe. Our next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen. You may ask your question. Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company LLC : Hi, there. Could you clarify the improvement that you expect in Medicaid in 2017 and give us a sense for magnitude there? What was kind of the profile versus your expectations this year? And what are you looking for in 2017 and how do you get there? And is your outlook towards Medicaid still from an M&A perspective kind of less Medicaid, more Medicare, unless it's Medicaid that helps you do duals? Like how do we think about the whole Medicaid proposition for you guys? Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.: Christine, it's Tom. First, I'll start with the results this year. So again, first, let's put this into context. Very small business for us, essentially, program, Texas and Illinois. And we noted some increased Medicaid MCR in the third quarter that basically continued into the fourth quarter. And the dynamics we called out then consistent. A little different in each state; Texas, largely pressure on long-term support service costs, Illinois, a bit of rate and mix of higher acuity patients. So, I'd say we called that out as an impact on the MCR, but keep in mind, it's relatively modest overall. And again, as we move into 2017, kind of the flip-side of that dynamics. We are expecting the MCR to improve in 2017. We're taking actions to improve results, but given the relatively small scale of Medicaid in our overall business, while it will be a positive factor in the MCR, it'll be modest, and it's really not really noticeable in the overall earnings momentum either way for the company. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: The M&A posture looking forward, first, relative to the marketplace, we view that over time that the Medicaid marketplace will continue to need to adopt more innovative solutions, whether they're active management, sub-program design, et cetera, care coordination program acceleration, and we think that that will over time create more opportunities both for the marketplace to grow and to bring innovative solutions as well as for ourselves. So I wouldn't limit it to duals. I would orient around programs where there is more active management, care coordination, value-based alignment, incentive-based programs, whether they be broad or narrowly focused. We see opportunities that we can bring value creation to the table, and over time, we think this marketplace will continue to evolve more in that direction. Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company LLC : And then one last follow-up. On Individual, are you willing to quantify the losses in 2016 and what you expect for 2017? Just because, you know, the sense we have is that there could be relief coming, and if investors know kind of what's expected and if there's any issues in 2017, I think we'll look through them, given that we'll either get relief or we'll exit. So it might be helpful to know kind of where we wound up and where we're expecting to go. Thanks. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Well, Christine, it's David. We haven't given you the exact numbers. The way we've described it is, and we've been consistent here, 2014, 2015, 2016, we expected not to make money, be it on an allocated or fully allocated basis, et cetera. At the end of the day, it is not a profitable block of business. It has been manageable. For 2017, we would expect to improve our profile somewhat, but it would still not be profitable. I think your big picture assumption, one way or the other, this book improves. It either improves fundamentally or it improves because it's no longer a sustainable offering for us and we choose not to participate in that marketplace. On a final note, for us, we've been really clear. This is not our number-one or number-two driver of our inflection point with the great outlook we have of earnings growth next year. It'll be a modest improvement off of its current baseline loss results. Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Christine Arnold. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. So if we make the assumption that we have to think about Plan B and what kind of capital deployments you're going to have, I guess definitionally, we will have seen the two big deals struck down. Do you \u2013 if that's what ultimately happens, do you feel like large M&A is kind of out of the question right now, and when we think about you deploying capital M&A, should it be around a number of smaller transactions, or do you think that these transactions don't reflect what could potentially happen down the road? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Good morning, Kevin. It's David. First of all, to capital deployment, as Tom noted, our priorities remain ensuring that we support our existing business needs. Second, we look at strategic M&A. And third, we look at opportunities to return excess capital to the shareholders. As we sit here today, our M&A priorities remain, and they've been consistent in terms of expanding our global footprint, expanding our U.S. seniors capabilities, expanding our retail base capabilities, opportunities for tuck-ins and opportunities to continue to expand our services for evolving state-based risk programs. I would not read into anything in terms of \u2013 you never say never in terms of large versus small. All deals stand on their own, and we would expect to be quite disciplined in terms of our approach going forward in terms of looking for on-strategy M&A opportunities and ensuring that they are value creative for shareholders as well as that we can create value for customers. And then with the tremendous capital balances we have in front of us, we recognize the significant responsibility that it is. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we have a track record of not letting that capital lie idle for any elongated length of time. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then I guess the other question that I would have for you is maybe if you could give us kind of a self-diagnostic of kind of the performance of the company over the last two years. I would argue going into the deal, you guys were probably one of the best operated companies for the five years heading into that deal. But then since the deal's been announced, we've had sanctions and Star ratings drops and a disability issue. I mean how do we think about kind of what happened in the last two years? Is it related to the deal overhang? Is there something else? And how do you feel like the company is positioned operationally, internally right now to operate as a standalone company? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Kevin, it's David. Real important question. A couple points. First, big-picture, I'm extraordinarily proud of our team. 40,000 plus colleagues around the world who wake up every day to do everything humanly possible to support our customers, our clients and work with our partners. And while we've had some challenges, which I will step up to in a moment, broadly speaking our customers, clients and partners have been buffered from that. So the value proposition we are delivering remains strong. And a way to evidence that is as you look at our 2017 growth trajectory, the ability to have outstanding retention once again with strong new business adds and expansion of relationships and delivering a tremendous, for example, medical cost trend once again, I think reinforces the value we're delivering. No doubt, when you have an environment where you'll have a disruptive overhang that now lapses 18 months, where we talk in our organization around keeping our eye focused on the marketplace, you always have a \u2013 kind of a small tension that builds over time. And while our team, I think, has done an outstanding job trying to keep that overhang distraction out of the way, indisputably that's going to creep into the organization, no matter how we communicate, align and try to stay focused. But again, our customers and clients have been well supported. Two different storylines relative to Seniors and the group business, neither of which we have time to get into in detail; regulatory and self-inflicted wounds that we own, and we are rapidly remediating them. And I think the bright spot here is that we delivered strong results for our clients and customers, and we're going to step in to 2018 and deliver an outstanding result for our clients and customers as well as our shareholders. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Kevin Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. You may ask your question. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : David, I've not heard you be as positive on the Medicaid business before on our conference call. And you in fact, mentioned it as one of the items for capital deployment in terms of state-based risk programs. Is that a change in your view of Medicaid going forward, and it's going to be a higher priority item for you to expand that business? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Yeah. Peter, we do not see it as a change. We see the market evolving, so let me be clear. If you go back to when we rolled out our Go Deep, Go Global, Go Individual strategy and laid out our M&A priorities all the way back some seven years ago, we put as a lower priority traditional Medicaid relative to the alternatives. We, all the way back then, had a view that the marketplace would evolve over time to more active management. And we thought the duals marketplace would be the first marketplace that evolved. So I would ask you not to read into my comments either way; rather, our organization is open-minded relative to targeted opportunities where we could create value. And where we see the opportunity to create value is by working collaboratively with health care professionals, with incentives, information, and care resources to provide better quality outcomes for individuals. And as states grapple with their budget challenges with a growing Medicaid population and growing health burden, we think programs will evolve and change and that will create opportunities. Those will be localized opportunities. We do not see it as the nation's profile will change overnight. There'll be localized opportunities that we want to be open-minded to and to be in a position to explore from a growth opportunity and value creation opportunity. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So is the evolution you're referring to the change on providers becoming more of a ACO organizations with yourselves, or is it something else with the Medicaid program that you think is evolving? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Two sides, but let's go to the first dimension. Indisputably as a country, we have an aging population, eroding health status and continued growth in chronic disease. Continuing to finance the access to care through traditional programs that simply attempt to, for example, push rates lower as a means of balancing budgets is running out of steam, period. Secondly, there are bright spots around the country of more innovative programs that state officials are driving to try to get more engagement of individuals and better value creation with health care professionals. That is resulting in changes in the delivery system, and there's a lot of bright spots around the country where delivery systems, be they physician groups, multispecialty groups, integrated hospital systems are aggressively exploring how they could do more value-based care. All those forces are changing. I wouldn't limit it to any one. All those forces are changing. But at the cornerstone is an increasing demand and need for care to be delivered and coordinated and the need to explore new solutions. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Peter Costa. Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning. David, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, I believe, that coming out of the sanctions in the Senior business you would have a stronger business, stronger platform, and I guess I'm curious on two things. One, if you're able to be a little more specific about the cadence of growth that you foresee in 2017 to the negative 50,000 member. Is that down further early and then growing later in the year, for example? And then is the chassis now something that you believe can support strong organic growth with obviously the caveat being that it sounds like you're still in negotiations with CMS around the Stars force? But is this chassis now strong enough to support an industry competitive growth rate in Medicare Advantage? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Yeah, Dave, first by way of just framing, right, we know the stats. Seniors continue to age into Medicare. Seniors who are looking at alternatives view Medicare Advantage quite favorably. It's not Cigna-specific at all; just Medicare Advantage. Medicare Advantage on average serves seniors with lower average income than fee-for-service, so they're high-value buyers. Medicare Advantage as an industry generates superior clinical outcomes through care coordination, and very importantly, the more innovative health care professionals appreciate the Medicare Advantage program as an opportunity to better coordinate care. Specific to Cigna, given that we have 85% of all of our Medicare Advantage lives in value-based programs, that creates both an opportunity in the future and it was a challenge going through the audit. And at the end of the day, the complexity is all those partnered relationships and the information flows, et cetera, that were needed to get through the audit process were challenging. We've built, to your term, a chassis now; a series of enhancements, that will put us in a much better position going forward not only to continue to serve the population where we're delivering very strong service and clinical outcomes today, but coordinate the information necessary in the evolving regulatory environment and continue to grow that chassis. So we believe it will be a very effective growth chassis for years to come for individual MA purchasers who want to be in aligned incentive-based programs with value-based care providers. So we're excited about the growth chassis over the long-term. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Dave Windley. Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. You may ask your question. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah, thanks. Good morning. My question is about the employer markets. The 300,000 to 500,000, I'm assuming a lot of that is coming from select and middle. That's where you're really growing. And you talk a lot about the senior story and so on, but haven't heard anything on your broad views on how the Republican plan on repeal and replace, the repeal of taxes which takes away some of that burden on employers and perhaps reduces the mix shift to being self-insured, how might all that play out, how are you trying to influence small group market reform, self-insurance stop loss? What are your organic and inorganic priorities there? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Ana, I tip my hat to you. I think you got about seven or eight questions in there. Let me attempt to be responsive to a bunch of quite important points. First, specific to our results, for 2017, the growth of 300,000 to 500,000 customers represents growth in national accounts, middle-market, select and international driven by very strong retention in all of those segments; good expansion of relationships and good targeted new business adds where our clinical capabilities, our incentive-based programs are hunting quite well. Specific to repeal and replace, and I appreciate you using that language, because I think repeal and replace is being used as language that is relatively broad sweeping, so as you very well know, the ACA had an impact, based on the way you asked your question, on the employer market, on the MA market, on the Medicaid market, as well as on the Individual market. And what we see happening today versus eight years ago is that there's a need for a change unequivocally, but there's also a lot of bright spots that have evolved over the last eight years. For example, in the employer market, there's way more adoption today of incentives, engagement and value-based care programs. MA has further evolved even more broadly adopting value-based care programs. As I noted in a prior comment, there are states that are changing Medicaid programs and evolving them to be more incentive or engagement based as we go forward. As it relates to the individual program, as noted by several people's questions, the marketplace is still unsustainable. And there's a lot of pressure to put a series of transparent changes in place for 2018 in the near future because organizations will have to make determinations in the spring of this year. As it relates to our growth priorities, they remain. We will grow our employer block of business in the United States and we see attractive growth opportunities in our targeted geographies, in our targeted segments with our capabilities. We see seniors continuing to be a growth chassis for us. We see broadening our specialty portfolio continuing to be a growth chassis. We have a sustained track record of growing our productivity management solutions out of our group portfolio. And then our international chassis continues to provide an exciting growth opportunity. So we're fortunate not to be dependent upon any one submarket. We're rather well-positioned from that standpoint. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the perspective. Operator : Thank you, Ana Gupte. Our next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Thank you. I had a clarification on the advance notice Star comment that you made earlier. It looked to me that the box proposal (1:00:30) suggested capping the sanction impact in the Star calculation and I understand it's too soon to quantify, but could you help us understand if this is supposed to be a positive or a negative? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Sarah, it's David. I'd put that in the too soon to tell. I understand the headline that you're referencing. I can't go into the kind of details of the subcomponents there, but I understand the point you're referencing. Our team is combing through that quite thoroughly literally as we speak and I would say stay tuned for more. Obviously a lot of moving parts in there and you identify actually one of the moving parts, which I think is trying to resequence some of the disconnects we've seen in some of the program designs. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Okay. Then on the Global Supplemental business, you mentioned that there was a headwind to margins from investments. Can you size the impact that the one-time investments had on margins? Where are you investing and how do you think about the long-term growth for this business? Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.: Well, Sarah, it's Tom. Again, that's strategic investments not investment income, of course, just to be clear on that. So that's basically the dynamic we have where we continue to invest to grow product choices, to grow distribution channels, to create more revenue growth opportunities in our overseas markets over time. Now generally, we've been able to fund that by finding operational efficiencies, but that's the dynamic. Calling out some of the increased strategic investments, underlying business growth and operating expense efficiencies is all netting to a good growth trajectory for our Global Supp business. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Is it still the mid-teens range? I think that's what you said in the past for long-term growth guidance but now that you're investing in addition to just offsetting with SG&A savings, do you still think it's a mid-teens growth profile business? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Longer-term outlook, obviously, if you look at our outlook for 2017, we've got, let's say, a 5% headwind in there for currency potential impacts. So it's a little less than that in the 2017 outlook, but over the longer-term that's a trajectory we'd expect to deliver. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Thank you Sarah James. Our final question comes from Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI. You may ask your question. Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Can you confirm whether the M&A remediation costs ended up at $100 million for the full year as you expected on the last call? And how much of a step down you're expecting this year? Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.: Michael, yes. They did up at the $100 million we expected, so no surprises in the fourth quarter. I don't think we quantified exactly what the step down will be, but it's of a substantial majority will be the step down in 2017. Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC : And maybe just one last quick sizing question. Can you quantify the Individual market losses that you saw in 2016, including the write-off of the risk corridor receivables? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Michael, it's David. I'll ask Tom to reiterate the risk corridor receivable in a moment. We've not quantified the Individual submarket's losses. We've continued to say that 2014, 2015, 2016 have been loss profiles for that smaller book of business. I'll remind you that we've run it in 2%, 3% of our aggregate revenue over time and I think our view is that as we look to the industry level margins, we're in the ballpark, or lack thereof margins, we're in the ballpark of that result, but we haven't given you the details on it. Tom, would you remind them of the write-off? Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.: On the risk corridor, again, that came in two flavors. The $80 million after-tax reflected the balance we had accrued at the end of September that was written off and reported as a special item, so not reflected in adjusted income from operations, and $16 million after taxes what we otherwise would've expected to accrue related to risk corridor recoveries in the fourth quarter which we were not able to accrue because we had written off the collectability. Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you, Michael Newshel. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Thank you. To conclude our call, I'd like to just underscore some key points from our discussion. We concluded the year with positive operating momentum as we enter 2017 with an expected attractive outlook to our growth profile. We reported strong revenue and earnings performance in our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses, and noted improvements in the latter half of the year with the challenges we confronted earlier in the year in our Group Disability and Life business. We remain committed to achieving our average annual EPS growth rate of 10% to 13% over the long-term. We are confident in our ability to deliver on our attractive 2017 outlook of 12% to 18% earnings growth, further strengthened by our meaningful capital position and exceptional flexibility. I'd once again like to thank my colleagues around the world who embody our mission and execute our strategy every day for the benefit of our customers, our clients and our partners. And I also want to thank you, our shareholders, for joining our call today and for your continued interest in Cigna. Thanks.

Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by for Cigna's First Quarter 2017 Results Review. At this time, all callers are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter queue to ask a question at that time. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We will begin by turning the call over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell. William McDowell - Cigna Corp.: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. Joining David and Tom for the Q&A portion of this morning's call is Eric Palmer, Cigna's Deputy Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's first quarter 2017 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2017. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders' net income, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2017 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, I note that in the first quarter, we recorded two charges to shareholders' net income, which we reported as special items. The first special item was an after-tax charge of $83 million or $0.32 per share due to a long-term care guaranty fund assessment related to Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary American Network Insurance Company. The second special item was an after-tax charge of $49 million or $0.19 per share for merger-related transaction costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of financial results. Also, consistent with past practices when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior-year development of medical costs. And with that I will turn the call over to David. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Thanks, Will. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Before we get started, I'd like to take a moment to thank Tom McCarthy for his many years of service with Cigna. As you know Tom announced his retirement this past February. Tom has not only been an instrumental leader within our organization for more than three decades with considerable accomplishments and contributions to our growth and success, he's also a good friend to many of us, and we'll miss him on a both personal and professional level. Tom's excited to start his next chapter and I know you'll join me in wishing him and Linda (3:51) all the best in his upcoming retirement. Also, Eric Palmer will be stepping into our CFO role the summer. Eric's a proven financially leader with a strong track record of accomplishments over his 20 years with our company, and I'm confident in the value he'll bring to the role. Eric's looking forward to discussions with you as we look ahead to Cigna's future and he'll be joining us for the Q&A portion of today's call. To begin this morning's call, I'll briefly highlight our strong financial results. I'll then discuss how our approach to engaging, incenting and supporting our customers and healthcare professionals, combined with our ongoing investments in innovative capabilities, continues to fuel our growth and drive differentiated value for our stakeholders. Tom will then address our first quarter financial results in more detail as well as provide more specifics for increased outlook for 2017 before we take your questions. And after Q&A I'll wrap up the call with a few closing remarks. I'll start with some highlights of our results. We started off 2017 with strong momentum in earnings growth across each of Cigna's business segments. For the first quarter of 2017, consolidated revenue increased 5% to more than $10 billion. We achieved 20% earnings growth with adjusted income from operations for the first quarter of $719 million or $2.77 per share. Our Global Health Care business delivered earnings growth of 12% over the first quarter of 2016 with strong customer growth across all Commercial market segments, increased contributions from specialty solutions, well-managed medical costs and effective operating expense management. Revenue growth in our Commercial employer business continues to be very strong as we retain, expand and add new customer relationships across National Accounts, Middle Market, Select and our International market segments. In the Individual market, we continue to take a measured approach, participating where we can best deliver value and accumulate learnings as that very dynamic environment continues to evolve. And in our Seniors business, we expect be in position to participate in the Open Enrollment cycle this fall. In our Global Supplemental Benefits business Cigna again had double-digit revenue and earnings growth while continuing to make targeted investments to support future growth. Results from our Group Disability and Life business are benefiting from continued stable results in our Life portfolio and further improvements in our Disability performance. Overall, we began 2017 with strong momentum that we expect to carry through the remainder of the year and as such have increased our outlook for revenue, medical customer growth and EPS. Now I'd like to transition to how our ongoing value creation for you, our shareholders, goes hand-in-hand with improving the lives of our customers. As you know, we remain focused on enhancing access to affordable personalized quality care when and where health care services are consumed, all while we continue to expand peace of mind solutions for our customers around the world. We continue to innovate new ways to incentivize, engage and support both customers and providers of healthcare in a very localized manner, an approach which our experience shows helps to identify health risks earlier while also providing customers with greater value when they do need health services. Our proven approach begins with active listening to best understand and address the specific evolving needs of our customers and clients. This critical first step fuels our highly consultative solution oriented actions where we leverage our broad portfolio of programs and services and our collaborative relationships with healthcare professionals to deliver high-value, personalized solutions at a local level. We also actively engage customers and providers to facilitate the achievement of individual health goals and to strengthen incentive alignment particularly for our highest performing health care partners. Further, by leveraging data and insights we are better positioned to identify health risks at an earlier stage and take actions which allow us to improve the quality of health outcomes at a lower cost. As for scale and reach, our collaborative arrangements now total approximately 250 physician-based group arrangements. In addition to these partnerships we also have value-based arrangements in place with more than 125 hospital systems comprised of hundreds of individual hospitals spanning more than 30 states. We view our continued strength in Collaborative Accountable Care as paramount to accelerating the shared goals of increased value and sustainability across the healthcare system. Taken together with our innovative clinical programs and broad array of specialty health programs, we continue to deliver industry-leading medical cost trend which directly benefits our customers and clients and as such you, our shareholders. In addition to our proven partnerships with healthcare professionals, we are taking our alignment and collaborative approach to pharmaceutical companies. We have created seven such arrangements in the past two years that base reimbursement on the efficacy of the drug, not just the consumption or volume of the drug. Our leadership and innovation in the space was recently recognized by the Pharmacy Benefit Management Institute with their excellence award in recognition of Cigna's strategic efforts to change the reimbursement model with drug manufacturers from volume to value as well as our use of outcome-based contracts which link financial terms to measured improvements in our customers health and our use of insights to inform future affordability strategies. These accomplishments represent a clear source of sustainable value creation for our business going forward, and as such, shareholder value creation. Our engagement with communities where we operate further complements our strategic growth initiatives and local focus. Because health is so highly personal and highly local, we believe that taking steps to demonstrably improve the health of the communities we serve is critical to creating a more sustainable healthcare system which in turn creates a better environment. We actively use our individual engagement tools to decrease the health risks in the communities we serve. These tools include differentiated partnerships as well as our information and insights and broad clinical programs. For example, we're working with communities to address the U.S. opioid addiction issue. We started in early 2016 by convening diverse leaders from public and private sectors and local communities across the U.S. from D.C. to LA and from Chicago to Houston. And with these leaders we are taking action to stem addiction before it starts as well as address the needs for those who are addicted. Additionally Cigna is committed to reducing our customers' opioid use by 25% by 2019 to take us back to pre-crisis levels, while still providing the right care at the right time for our customers. To date, more than 150 forward-looking physician groups with nearly 62,000 physicians have signed on to actively honor our shared pledge, which is driving meaningful improvement already. For example, to-date, we've already delivered a 12% reduction in our customers use of opioid pharmaceuticals. Another example of our focus on communities is the Cigna Health Improvement Tour, a multi-city tour bringing free health screening and health coaching to communities nationwide so people can learn their numbers for four key indicators of chronic health concerns including blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol and BMI. To date, our tour has visited 18 cities and has had interactions with thousands of people. Our approach to partnering with our communities is another pathway towards creating greater access to more affordable, personalized and a more sustainable healthcare system. Now as I noted earlier, creating differentiated value for our clients and customers also enables us to deliver differentiated value for you, our shareholders. A part of that value is underscored in our exceptionally strong capital position and strategic financial flexibility at Cigna. We continue to expect to have over $5 billion of deployable capital at the parent company level in 2017, a testament to the strength and capital efficiency of our operating businesses. Given our under-levered balance sheet, as previous discussed, we also expect a significant increased degree of capital deployment capacity by returning to more normalized leverage ratios. Consistent with our prior comments, depending on the mix of share repurchase, dividend and M&A, we continue to expect capital deployment capacity of $7 billion to $14 billion in 2017. We remain very well-positioned to deliver attractive shareholder value over the long-term through a combination of strong organic revenue earnings growth and effective capital deployment. I'll now briefly touch upon the status of our proposed combination with Anthem. As you saw last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the District Court enjoining the merger. This morning Anthem announced that it has filed a petition with the United States Supreme Court seeking a review of the decision by the Court of Appeals. On May 8, there will be a hearing in the Delaware Chancery Court to determine Cigna's rights to terminate the merger agreement. We will update you when there is additional news to share. Now before I hand the call over to Tom, I'd like to reiterate a few key points. The momentum we closed 2016 with has continued into 2017. We've started the year with strong results highlighted by double-digit earnings growth and strength in each of our operating business segments. This performance gives us added confidence that we will achieve our increased 2017 earnings outlook which is now a growth rate of 15% to 20% versus 2016. We're continuing to deliver value with an emphasis on personalization, affordability and being the partner of choice. Over the last couple of years we've positioned ourselves through ongoing investments in innovative capabilities and programs. We are positioned with outstanding capital strength, and as a global health service company we are creating significant value for all of our stakeholders thanks to the passion and dedication of our Cigna colleagues around the world. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.: Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna's first quarter 2017 results and discuss our outlook for the full year. Key financial highlights in the quarter are consolidated revenue growth of 5% to $10.4 billion, consolidated earnings growth of 20% to $719 million including double-digit earnings growth in each of our business segments; quarterly earnings per share growth of 19% to $2.77 per share; and continued strong free cash flow and financial flexibility. Overall, the strength of our first quarter performance provides us with solid momentum to start the year. Regarding our business segments, I will first comment on Global Health Care. First quarter premium and fees in Global Health Care grew to $7.3 billion driven by strong customer growth and specialty contributions across all Commercial market segments, partially offset by the expected contraction in our Seniors enrollment. We ended first quarter 2017 with 15.7 million global medical customers, an organic increase of 537,000 lives year to date. First quarter earnings increased 12% to $610 million reflecting growth in medical customers and specialty relationships, continued effective medical cost management and favorable prior-year reserve development. Turning to our medical care ratios, our first quarter 2017 total Commercial medical care ratio or MCR of 77.6% reflects ongoing strong performance of our Commercial business and favorable prior-year reserve development. The increase in the first quarter of 2017 MCR relative to the first quarter of 2016 reflects the impact on premium of the health insurance tax moratorium. Our first quarter 2017 total Government MCR of 85.9% reflects continued effective medical cost management for our advanced physician engagement model, quarterly seasonal impacts and favorable prior year development. First quarter 2017 Global Health Care earnings included favorable prior-year development of $61 million after-tax compared to $14 million after-tax in the first quarter of 2016. Moving to operating expenses, for first quarter 2017 our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 20.5% which reflects the impact of the health insurance tax moratorium, business mix changes and continued effective expense management. Overall, we've had a strong start to 2017 in our Global Health Care business. Turning to our Global Supplemental Benefits business, premiums and fees grew to $869 million, an increase of 13%. First quarter 2017 earnings grew 10% to $74 million reflecting business growth and strong operating expense management. This business has once again delivered double-digit growth as our customers continue to value the affordable and personalized solutions we deliver through an increasingly diverse and innovative set of distribution models. For Group Disability and Life, first quarter premiums and fees were just over $1 billion. First quarter earnings in our Group business was $68 million with our Life business performing as expected and Disability results reflecting a better-than-expected pace of improvement from the claims process modifications made last year. Overall Cigna's first quarter results reflect strong double-digit earnings growth in each of our business segments. We also continue to generate very strong free cash flow from our businesses and have significant financial flexibility. Now I will discuss our outlook for 2017. In 2017 we expect to continue to deliver strong financial performance for our shareholders by leveraging our differentiated capabilities to deliver affordable and personalized solutions, continuing to invest in capabilities to better serve our customers and clients and effectively deploying capital. For full year 2017, we now expect consolidated revenues to grow in the range of 3% to 4% over 2016 results, an improvement from our previous expectations driven by our increased medical customer growth outlook for 2017. Our outlook for full year 2017 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $2.41 billion to $2.53 billion or $9.25 to $9.75 per share. This represents an increase of $0.25 per share over previous expectations and represents earnings growth of 15% to 20% over 2016. I will now discuss the components of our 2017 outlook starting with Global Health Care. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of $2.065 billion to $2.135 billion. The assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2017 include the following : Regarding global medical customers, we now expect growth in the range of 500,000, to 600,000 lives over year-end 2016, an increase over previous expectations reflecting the strong growth we have seen across our Commercial market segments. Turning to medical costs, for our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we continue to expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%. We continue to drive greater incentive alignment for our customers, clients and physician partners resulting in positive health outcomes and better management of total medical costs. Now turning to our medical care ratio outlook. For our total Commercial book of business, we continue to expect the 2017 MCR to be in the range of 80.5% to 81.5%. For our total Government book of business, we continue to expect the 2017 MCR to be in the range of 85% to 86%. Regarding operating expenses, we continue to expect our 2017 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 20.5% to 21.5%. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth and earnings in the range of $295 million to $315 million. Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we now expect full year 2017 earnings in the range of $230 million to $260 million, an increase of $30 million over our previous expectations, reflecting continued operational improvements in our Disability business. Regarding our remaining operations, that is Other Operations and Corporate, we continue to expect a loss of $180 million for 2017. So all in, for full year 2017 we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.41 billion-$2.53 billion or $9.25 to $9.75 per share. This represents an increase of $0.25 per share over our previous expectations. I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior-year reserve development or any future capital deployment. Now moving to our 2017 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have excellent financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well-capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with a strong return on capital in each of our business segments, and we have significant free cash and leverage capacity available at the parent company. Our capital deployment strategy and priorities remain, providing the capital necessary to support the growth of our ongoing operations, pursuing M&A activity with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow in our targeted areas of focus, and after considering these first two items, would return capital to shareholders primarily through share repurchase. Regarding free cash flow, we ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $2.7 billion. Year to date, we repurchased 2.3 million shares of stock for approximately $340 million. During the first quarter, we also deployed $250 million of parent company cash to repay current maturities of long-term debt and made a voluntary contribution to our pension plan of $150 million. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we continue to expect deployable capital to exceed $5 billion in 2017. Through May 4, we have used $340 million of the total $3.7 billion of share repurchase capacity authorized by our board. Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook remain strong benefiting from industry-leading margins and returns on capital in our businesses and a high level of capital efficiency, particularly from our fee-based business. Now to recap. Our first quarter 2017 consolidated results reflect strength in a diversified portfolio of global businesses and continued effective execution of our focus strategy. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by our first quarter results, which reflected strong revenue and earnings contributions from each of our business segments, industry-leading medical cost trend and high clinical quality, and continued strong free cash flow. Overall, we are pleased with our strong start to the year and are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year 2017 earnings outlook. On a final note, as David mentioned, I have announced my retirement effective this summer. I appreciate the kind words and would like to express my gratitude to David and all of my talented Cigna colleagues for their partnership and friendship. I believe strongly in Cigna's mission and our continued focus on improving health, well being and sense of (24:15) security of those we serve, and I have enjoyed my many discussions with the investment community and know that you are in good hands with Eric Palmer when he takes over the role as CFO. With that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : One moment please for the first question. Our first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck. Sir, your line is open. You may ask your question. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. Thanks, and thanks, Tom, for your help over the years. Must be something in the air, it seems like a lot of people are retiring now. But again, thanks for your help. I guess my first question would be the guidance raise, you beat consensus by more than what you raised guidance for for the year. Just wondering if there's anything that you would highlight as far as timing in the quarter, or any increased pressures that you look for in the back half of the year. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Kevin, good morning; it's David. First, just at a macro level, we're quite pleased with the start of year, and just putting it into context, we set a pretty meaningful earnings growth goal for the organization for 2017 in the 12% to 18% range and we're quite pleased to start with this strength and raise that outlook to a 15% to 20% range. It's early in the year. We feel really good about the fundamentals from the revenue to the customer life growth, to the foundational aspects within the business, and look forward to a very good year. There's nothing beyond other than a strong start to the year, we feel quite good about raising the outlook, and it's early in the year, hence we think the raise is appropriate and for an (26:24) appropriate range. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then I guess as far as the guidance on trend goes, a lot of favorable developments. Maybe you can (26:33) give a little bit of color about how much was in each business Commercial versus Government. And then how you're looking at the buckets of trend and how they're shaping up. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Kevin, I'll just frame it and ask Eric to give you a little bit relative to the way our medical costs more broadly are unfolding. First off, to put it back in context, we're starting the year again quite positive. The -- put it back into context, 2016 we delivered another very strong year of below 4% medical cost trend. We set an expectation for ourself for this year of 4.5% to 5.5%, and we're performing well within those -- the construct. We typically don't break out the prior year development by micro line of business. Eric can give you a little bit direction there and then the little bit of color relative to just the core medical cost trend we're seeing within the business by some of the categories. Eric? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Good morning, Kevin. It's Eric. As David noted for 2016 we did finish the trend at just under 4% and really see the categories within the medical cost trend from 2016 continuing into 2017 and generally the same ranges across each of inpatient, outpatient, physician and pharmacy. We're in the kind of low- to mid-single digits in each category, nothing that I'd call out as particularly changing through the early part of this year. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Your line is open. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I guess first question just on the PBM strategy. I was wondering if you just give us an update on your thoughts and how you are perceiving the service, and what you're getting from Optum. Obviously you guys have chosen to stick with them through the change of control, et cetera. And so I'm curious just your perspectives on the PBM. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Josh, it's David. First, broadly relative to the PBM, our view relative to the services we need to deliver is that the broad-based pharmacy capabilities are one of the most critical capabilities to have an overall effective health service offering. To put your question back into context and be clear, today we own and fully operate our PBM and continue to. We partner where appropriate, and work to actively integrate our capabilities, and we're quite pleased with the outcomes we're delivering for the benefit of our customers, the service, the clinical quality. Eric just made reference to the sustained medical cost trend in the mid-single digit range, great value for our employer clients. And importantly, our approach to the integrated PBM presents even a further opportunity to integrate the information, the clinical program, the gap in care closure with our health care professionals. So own and operate, partner where appropriate, it's performing well and we're pleased. Lastly, in addition to the trend, I would note we've continued to successfully grow our PBM covered lives of our customer base pretty meaningfully and I think that's also a testament to the value we're delivering. So performing very well for us. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then just a quick follow up on your comments, David. You said you guys were confident you'd be able to participate in the Open Enrollment Period for Medicare in the fall. I know we're still several months away but the sanctions have taken a little bit longer, I guess, than we would have expected. So I'm curious, what gives you the confidence that that's going to get resolved here? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Sure, Josh. Well, first and foremost, as we stepped into this process early on and we've set an extremely aggressive push for our organization to attempt to get all of the issues resolved before the prior year's Open Enrollment process, acknowledging that it was an extraordinary, at least short timeframe based on historical standards. Once that window eclipsed we set our sights toward, obviously, fully finishing the remediation work, which we're at the final aspects of. Point two is ensuring that we position ourselves to come out of this phase with an even stronger business unit, operating platform, and team and we're literally in the latter chapters of the body of work, ongoing dialogue, interaction with CMS as we speak. Lastly, just to reinforce, we're pleased with, while we don't like to shrink, we're pleased with the fact that our retention rates held up quite strongly through this process and I think that's a further validation and testament to the strength of the physician partnerships and collaboratives, with 85% of all of our MA lives in collaboratives and our very strong HealthSpring team that wakes up every day to serve our customers. So we're in the final chapter. We're having ongoing interaction and dialogue with CMS and we're planning for, in all aspects, to be in the fall enrollment cycle. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Hi, everybody and, Tom, I also add my best wishes to you going forward. You showed 3% \u2013 I think I have 3% enrollment growth in your National Accounts business and we did a quick scan and we may be wrong but it looks like the first time you've shown growth in since 2012 actually. What's happening there? And is there any reason to believe either the underlying market, your wins? Can you give us some sense of the dynamics? And I think you've traditionally characterized this as a gradually declining market but any updated thoughts on that. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Yeah, it's David. Thank you for the question. First and foremost, we're quite pleased with our customer growth coming into the year. We've set an objective for ourselves to grow in the 300,000 to 500,000 range and we're able to increase that outlook. First, broadly speaking, we've seen strong retention results, good new business adds and good expansion of relationships across all of our Commercial business segment. So quite important. Specific to the U.S. National Accounts, and as you know we define National Accounts as commercial employers with 5,000 or more employees that are multi-state. The employment base in that market has more stabilized now versus the continued 2% or so attrition, broadly speaking, as you look at the marketplace. We've had a great selling season coming into 2017, outstanding retention, good expansion, and good new business adds. I would add to the notion of our approach, that consultative approach is working quite well here in our National Account team, both our sales team, our client management team, aided by our informatics experts and our clinicians who've just done an outstanding job. Those employers are benefiting by our superior medical cost trend and it's working quite well in the market. The only add I would give you, A.J., is that we did see some further contributions to the National Account number off of some private exchange growth, as well, which is additive to this. I would say it's complementary but the foundation performed quite well. And then in our target go-deep markets and geographies, we saw some good growth on private exchange as well. So net-net, a strong Commercial performance. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then just as a follow up, I might ask you about the Individual business. You actually almost, I think, doubled the memberships if I've got it right, from where you exited last year. Is that in keeping with what you, sort of, thought? Give us a sense of, if you look at the demographic profile of those new members, is there anything there that's surprising or is it, sort of, similar what you've seen before? And any early comment about your thoughts about next year's participation on exchanges and so forth? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: A.J., a bunch of questions there. Let me try to frame the environment as we see it. First, as you know, we've taken a very measured approach since the inception of the exchanges to this marketplace. We've been in a range of five to seven states and 2% to 4% of our enterprise revenue in these programs. We still have to engage here to learn and to evolve the programs we've put in place. And we've seen some successful recipes by using our highly performing collaborative models. Specific to your question, our growth is about where we expected it to be. The locations of our growth, the aggregate growth and our performance in the first quarter is about where we expected it to be as well. Relative to 2018, while it's already late in the cycle, unfortunately it's too early to declare because as you know, the evolving rules, regs and positioning coming out of Washington is still pretty dynamic and we're tracking it day-to-day and working with the federal government. So growth in line with our expectations. First quarter performance in line with our expectations. Highly focused in seven states today and highly focused through our collaborative relationships. Stay tuned for more relative to 2018 as the final fact set closes relative to the regulatory environment. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : And thank you, Mr. Rice. And our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe. Your line's open, with Citi. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Tom, congrats on the retirement and thanks for all your help. I guess I wanted to also ask on the Commercial market, you mentioned \u2013 Commercial risk, I guess more particularly. You mentioned a little bit on the exchanges but you also had a pop in experience-rated. David, you talked about active listening to your customer base. Maybe can you flesh that out a little bit in terms of your offering and maybe factors driving accounts to perhaps incrementally pick that offer? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Ralph, just framing it from a broad standpoint, our sales and client management team, supported by our underwriters, informatics and clinical team; we attempt to approach the market in terms of a solution orientation. So understanding the clients' needs; understanding their health burden; understanding their culture and strategy; understanding their readiness to change; recommend a series of programs : service, design, et cetera; and then engage with them on funding approach with a pretty agnostic orientation relative to ASO, ASO stop-loss experience-rated guaranteed cost. And that's one of our strengths. And you'll see ebbs and flows over time. Now we had good growth in all of our customer segments for 2017 thus far and good growth in all of our funding mechanisms. I wouldn't call out anything unique relative to experience-rated there. It's a part of our franchise that we've used over quite some time; and typically, that hunts well in the middle market. Lastly as I said to a prior call, we saw a little bit more uptick in the private exchange lives. They were split about 50-50; you could think about that between ASO and guaranteed cost on the National Account franchise. So, again, nothing to call out other than strong growth and leveraging the broad portfolio of funding mechanisms we have. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. And then in the last couple quarters you had cited some pressure on Medicaid, I think in Texas and Illinois. Is that largely fixed or still a drag? And I guess any incremental thoughts on your interest in getting bigger in Medicaid, just given relatively low exposure today? Thanks. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Ralph, it's Eric. I'll remind you, Medicaid's a small business for us. It is a small business for us. Essentially just the Dual SNP programs in Texas and the demonstration projects in Illinois. And as you noted, we did report an increase at Medicaid MCR in Texas and Illinois towards the tail end of last year and still a bit elevated in the first quarter this year. But, again, overall a small business for us. I would note that we do not plan to participate in the Illinois Medicaid market beyond the end of this year, so the exit of that business is contemplated in our outlook. The last thing I guess I'd add on the Medicaid business is that we did see some sequential improvement. Some of the actions we took out of the tail end of last year have started to have some traction in terms of improving the results, but again first quarter Medicaid loss ratio a little bit pressured versus first quarter of 2016. David'll give some color on the more macro framing. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Ralph, on the long-term we're looking forward. As we've discussed in the past, one of our M&A capital deployment priorities is to seek opportunities to expand, as we say our capabilities to serve Government-based high-risk programs over time. We believe the marketplace will continue to evolve to use more actively managed and collaborative-oriented programs relative to both state and federal programs that serve the higher-risk population. And over time, we see opportunities in a more localized manner to pursue those as we look to the future. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : And thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. Our next question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Tom, good luck on the retirement; well-deserved. So first, sounds like you're seeing faster improvement in the Disability business. Can you talk about the drivers here relative to expectations? And how should we think about exiting the year? Can we get back to historical margins at the end of 2017 or is that still an 2018 event? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Justin, it's David. Good morning. First and foremost, we're pleased with the performance. We saw a step up in Q3 of last year, Q4 we see strong performance in the first quarter this year with stable ongoing results on the Life side. The Disability results were a little stronger in the first quarter than even we had anticipated which is good. And we're pleased to take up the outlook for that line of business. As we look forward to the core of your question, we remain fully focused on completing all the bodies of work that are in front of us relative to stabilizing that business. And our expressed objective is that we step out of 2017 with the full strength of that organization as we look to 2018. That's our objective, and we're well on our way relative to that goal. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Then just a question on timing. Without prognosticating on the outcome, can you tell us what your legal team expects in terms of how fast we get a resolution on the TRO post Monday's hearing? And then should it go your way and the deal officially breaks, what would you expect your timing to be in terms of potentially coming back to the Street with more color on capital deployment? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Justin, relative to Monday's court review and decision, not helpful for us to speculate on the outcome or the timing of that. Clearly, we'll be in position to communicate as quickly as possible, and recognize the importance relative to that, but not helpful for us to speculate on the timing or the outcome there, but it's on the immediate horizon. To the core of your question, we would challenge ourself once there's open clarity to be as comprehensive and timely as possible for our shareholders to communicate next steps for our organization. And I would think you'd have confidence that we've always been both transparent and responsive and we would seek to be highly transparent and responsive as soon as the window opens to have that conversation. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Thanks. Operator : And thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question is from Gary Taylor, JPMorgan. Your line is open. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. I just actually had three quick clarifications, and then one question. But the quick ones, when you talk about the less than 4% medical cost trend for 2016, I presume you're talking a gross number, and not a net number, net of buy down? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: The way we would frame it, I'm not sure how you're applying the net gross et cetera. We would view that as the net number that our clients and customers experience and noting that the vast majority of our business is self-funded. That's the net number of what they're seeing. And of course, you used the term buy downs. Evolution of the benefit programs is obvious factored in and contemplated within that. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And on the MA sanctions, I've heard your comments on that. Would you be willing to venture a guess on timing, so Open Enrollments obviously far away, but is there any way to tighten up when you think you might be able to announce that the issues are resolved? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Gary, David. Not helpful to try to put a pin point number on that. Most important piece, we remain fully focused, aligned and prepared for the Open Enrollment process for the fall cycle. Beyond that not helpful to expand further. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. And on the EPS guidance for this year, I'm sorry if you've said this, but I presume there's no additional repurchase in there beyond what you did in the 1Q. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Gary, it's Eric. No additional capital deployment or any expectations about future prior-year development in our guidance. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then my last question, kind of my real question following a little bit on Justin. You've terminated the merger agreement and the judge has enjoined that pending this hearing. Is there a scenario where that enjoinment could continue and this SCOTUS appeal actually matters in terms of timing? Or do you expect a definitive answer on Monday? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Gary, it's David. First I compliment the efficiency of getting four questions in. Well done on your part. Specific to Monday, we're not going to expand further in terms of speculating the outcome relative to the court. We leave it to the courts to draw the conclusion, and we will communicate this immediately as quickly as possible after there's clarity in terms of next steps. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Thank you Mr. Taylor. Our next question is from Chris Rigg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Just wanted to \u2013 and you've talked about this a little bit already \u2013 but when I look at the Global Health Care adjusted income guidance, the revision, it's up about $25 million, but you had the PPD of 61. So I just want to make that it's really just \u2013 you're baking in some conservatism right now, and there's no offsetting impact factor to the PYD. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Chris, it's David. As I indicated to a prior question relative to the outlook, first off, macro \u2013 we set a pretty meaningful increase relative to the franchise performance for 2017 as we stepped into the year. We're pleased to actually have such a strong quarter and be able to raise our outlook. There is nothing unique to call out. It's just early in the year, a variety of moving parts, and we look forward to continuing to deliver strength as we look forward. But there's nothing unique to call out relative to moving items within the Global Health Care business. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then just on Medicare Advantage, do you think that you're going to see \u2013 are you troughing the membership and that you should see some growth later in the year, because the sanctions should be lifted midyear or something like that? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Our organization's orientation is going to be as soon as sanctions are lifted, we're ready to roll. The team is anxious to get back into the marketplace. It's a very capable, prideful, passionate team that have the deep position partnerships, and everybody's ready to move as soon we're given the green light relative to CMS's conclusion. So if that happens prior to the Open Enrollment cycle, there'll be activation in the current year, et cetera. So we're ready to move. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks a lot. Operator : And thank you, Mr. Rigg. Our next question is from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Your line's open. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, good luck, Tom, and thanks for all the clear disclosure and help over the years. David, nice quarter. I'd like to focus back again on the membership growth. Whenever we see big membership growth, we always get concerned about things, and so we wanted to pick out a few risks and ask you which of the risks you think are the most significant and the ones that are most concerning to you. So if you look at like the Individual business, that grew very fast, and a lot of other competitors have had issues there. So is that a bigger risk than, say, the risk of the Anthem merger agreement continuing on and impacting your business overall and causing a slowdown in that membership growth or overall membership growth? And then perhaps the risk of \u2013 a lot of your competitors have talked about alternative funding arrangements and starting to go into the smaller accounts with that, which was historically one of your key strengths. And I guess the last one is just maybe the risk of overall pricing relative to medical costs trend. Are you confident that your view on trend is the right one considering it's lower than many of your competitors? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Peter, let me try to package the framework of your questions together and try to be responsive to all the items you raised. First and foremost, stepping back, most important headline, we're pleased with our outlook. Remember, we've set an expectation for ourselves to grow 300,000 to 500,000 lives, so we expect it to grow across our business. We had expectations to grow the Individual business. We had expectation to grow the Commercial business. We understood we would strengthen the Seniors business. That was contemplated within that. Within all of our businesses, we're essentially in line with expectations save for a little bit more strength in the National Accounts and a little bit more strength in the regional markets. So headline, we expect it to grow. We've grown. We've grown across all of our funding mechanisms, and by line of business or by segment, in line with expectations with a bit more strength in National Accounts, which is great, as well as the regional segment. Point two, you identified a bunch of risks. I maybe go to the end of your question and work my way back. As I discussed before, our approach has been for quite some time not to be in a position to sell products but rather to try to put in place a framework of solutions. So having the capabilities to do so is one thing, having the talent to do so is another thing, and having the information and infrastructure to support that is another thing. While our organization is far from perfect, we're sitting on a decade of investments to be able to deliver that, and our really talented team is able to be consultative in support of our clients and customers in the marketplace today and move the levers that best match those clients' needs relative to benefit design, engagement, incentive, network design, collaborative leverage, and then get the right funding mechanism in place. And the proof is in the pudding in terms of multiple years of lowest industry medical cost trend, last year below 4%. Targeted 4.5% to 5.5% for this your, performing in line with those expectations and moving forward. Now to try to come back to the core of your question, if you had to pin us down in terms of what would be the number one variable that sits in front of us right now, you still have to come back to the Individual market just because as an industry there's variability relative to that. I would remind you it remains less than 5% of overall revenue for our organization. We're focused in seven states. We exited three states coming into 2017 where we couldn't get the recipe we wanted in place, and the vast majority of what we're doing right now are aligned to the physician collaboratives and we performed, generally speaking, in line with our expectations for the first quarter. But there would be more variability in that than our other lines of business just because of the nature of that animal. But we're off to a start with the number of lives, the location of the lives, and the performance of those lives year-to-date, already. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Very helpful. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Costa. Our next question is from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Sir, your line is open. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Tom, best of luck in retirement. At the risk of asking something maybe a little more precisely but that you've generally answered on, on National Accounts and the growth there, we maybe heard some comments around lack of price discipline, not from you necessarily, but in the market, in general. And, David, you just mentioned, kind of, selling solutions. I'm wondering if the comments that were made in the prepared remarks about larger specialty contribution and penetration are wrapped up in that solutions answer that you just gave. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Well, Dave, remember first and foremost, if you take National Accounts, think about that marketplace as traditionally largely self-funded. So let's go back to the base frame. Outstanding retention year, so clients who are experiencing the service value proposition medical cost trend, et cetera, are pleased, therefore, staying with us. We could either drive innovation, changes, et cetera, but it starts with really strong retention. Second is earning the right to expand relationships with our existing corporate clients, either through adding new geographies for medical or further expanding the specialty solutions which is a cornerstone of our strategy, and then targeted new business adds. As I noted earlier, we've also been able to perform on some of the private exchanges. There we orient relative to our very targeted go-deep orientation on key geographies where we believe we have a differentiated value proposition from collaboratives or otherwise and target some opportunities there. So we feel quite good about the quality of the business that's been put in the books. Important to underscore though, this all starts with an outstanding retention result. Outstanding retention in National, regional and Select then further expansion, then targeted adds. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Got it. Thank you. Just a quick question on Group Disability and Life. There are usually reserve studies annually. Wondering if there's anything anticipated coming out of that that is included in the guidance around Group and Disability for the balance of the year. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Dave, it's Eric. Yeah, we will complete our disability reserve study in the second quarter. However, we wouldn't expect any significant impact from reserve studies and nothing built into the guidance. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you Mr. Windley. Our next question is from Tom Carroll from Stifel. Sir, your line is open. Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. So I have a question as well on the Global Sup and Disability and Life business. Are you seeing larger investment income in both of those areas because of the interest rate environment? And then, I guess as a follow-up to that, I imagine this will eventually benefit the Health Care business at some point and maybe could you remind us of earnings support per 100 basis points of rate change, however, you'd like to define that. Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.: Tom, it's Tom. We are seeing a little bit of a lift as interest rates go up but let's just put this into context, right? Most of our investment income relates to longer tailed reserves and, as a result, we have an average maturity of six maturities \u2013 it's long, about six years, let's say. And given that any change in interest rates tends to work their way into results, given that any change in interest rates tends to work their way into results over a long period of time as our invested assets mature and they are reinvested over the year. So to your point, 100 basis points increase now. Over the balance of the year, probably ends up with a net investment income in the $10 million to $15 million pre-tax range. So it's modest. Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you so much. Great quarter. Operator : Thank you Mr. Carroll. Our next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Ma'am, your line is open. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. And I want to echo the comments to Tom. I wanted to go back to retention because Cigna's really stood out from peers on retention and I think it feeds into your low cost trend. One of your peers is starting a big retention initiative focusing on Net Promoter Score as the method to boost retention. Is there any efforts underway at Cigna to focus on Net Promoter Score? And how do you think about Commercial employer retention heading into 2018? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Sarah, good morning, it's David. We obviously, we've always talked about our growth strategy being oriented around retain, expand, add, because again you have to deliver on your promise relative to your existing clients and customers to earn the right, first off, to keep the relationships, ideally to expand the relationships on the targeted basis, and then new business adds. We talk within our corporation around a culture and an environment of customer centricity, putting the customer in the center of all we do. I forget how many years ago it was. We started measuring Net Promoter Score on a global basis multiple years ago, feels like five years ago or so. We have it built into the incentive structure of the organization for everybody in the organization from me on down to anybody who's in a variable reward structure. And we think it's an important part. It's not the singular part, but it's an important part of understanding both relational NPS, that's the aggregate relationship, the loyalty factor et cetera. But then you have the ability to get really pinpointed as well in terms of transactional NPS. It helps you actually guide your business during the course of the year as opposed to waiting for the longer-tailed relational. So you want to look at both of those pieces of the equation. And lastly to further expand this, we carry that orientation beyond our customers to our clients and our key health care professional partners as well. Understanding that orientation of beyond satisfaction, loyalty effect, and where dissatisfiers are versus satisfiers and continuing your innovative evolution around that is mission-critical. So we've been committed to this for a long period of time, and it's one of the mechanisms we use around our customer-centricity focus. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: That's very helpful. And just one clarification on your earlier comments around building out capabilities for the high acuity Medicaid. I wanted to get a sense of timing there. Is this a near-term focus given that we're heading into a more robust LTSS and ABD RFP cycle in the next 12 to 24 months? Or is this more of a long-term goal? Though not necessarily in place for this round of contract opportunities, but a long term service? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Sarah, I would think about it intermediate to long term. This is not a 12-month horizon item for us currently. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you Ms. James. Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Ma'am, your line is open. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Thanks, good morning. My question was around the alternate funding on self-insured with stop-loss. You're growing really nicely in stop-loss and still in double digits on Select to low single in Middle Market. With the passage of repeal-and-replace with the tax relief for employers, do you see the growth rates likely to sustain? And what kind of communication are you getting from them? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Ana, a big picture, no is the answer. We don't see any disruption relative to that. So, yes, we expect the growth rate to sustain going-forward. And as you step back from it, having the \u2013 our belief that is then having the transparent funding mechanisms to better align ourselves with the employers, enables us to have daily, weekly, monthly interaction with the employers as opposed to an annual interaction relative to the performance. And then dynamically manage, engage in how the programs are operating. For the smaller side of the employer space, as you move down beyond National into the lower end of Middle Market and into Select, the stop-loss component adds a measure of certainty and predictably for the employers and it augments. We never viewed that the prior law with the tax was an accelerant. We don't view that the current proposed changes will be a decelerant, because we didn't see it as (57:42) push either way. It's an important toolset to have to be consultative and transparent with our employers, and we continue to see good growth there. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. A follow up on that again on policy. At the state level post the elections, the Republicans did quite well. What is the climate looking like on that support for the 50 to 100 portion of the self-insured plus stop-loss, has that approved at all? Because the focus on trying to stabilize Individual and encourage dumping, and I'm not sure if I'm right or wrong on that. But has it gotten any better there? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Yeah, Ana, to your macro point, it's been a little choppy ride in terms of narratives and obviously state level there's 50 different narratives, 50 different dialogue points. First, stepping back, putting it back in context, historically, Cigna's not participated in, or focused on the under 50 employer segment. Our Select segment is focused on the needs for the under 250 life employer segment historically and typically in the 50 to 250 segment. There's a few states that actually moved that line from 50 to 100, and some modification to our approaches took place, but our growth hasn't been impacted. More broadly, to the core of your question, and from a state standpoint, as we interact at both the federal level and state level, we strongly believe that enablement of more choice versus restrictive regulation is critical, including in the small employer market. And enabling access to the innovative programs that are working more broadly in the employer market that have transparency, have the incentive, have the engagement capabilities are good for the employer, the customer and the health care professionals. And it varies by state, but we're seeing good understanding and acceptance of that; and very importantly, a lot of activation and support from the employer community itself wanting to amplify that dialogue. Because again it's their employees, their financing and their needs and they're seeing value there. So a dynamic environment and it will continue to be and we'll stay engaged. But for our Select segment, we see great growth opportunities looking forward. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks, David, and thanks, Tom, for everything. Good luck. Operator : And thank you, Ms. Gupte. Our next question comes from Mike Newshel with Evercore ISI. Sir, your line's open. Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI : Thank you. You mentioned plans to exit the Medicaid business in Illinois. Is that running at a loss currently; and if so, could the exit translate into any noticeable tailwind in 2018? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Michael, it's Eric. I think the dimensions around that, I would say it's kind of near breakeven. Wouldn't characterize it as a major headwind or a tailwind in terms of the impact. Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI : Got it. And I think you also said the Individual and Commercial performance is tracking in line with expectations. So just to clarify on margins, does that mean they're still negative but better than last year? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Yes. Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI : Great. Thank... David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Perfectly summarized, Michael, yes. Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And thank you, Mr. Newshel. Our last question comes from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Sir, your line's open. Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks a lot. David, employers are increasingly asking for tools that help their employees better navigate the health care system balancing cost and quality in light of the increased prevalence of high deductible plans. Just curious of your thoughts and positioning on that and any potential timing of new offerings along those lines. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Michael, good morning. So we actually strongly agree with that. So the ability as we talk about to engage, incent and support Individual customers is critical to the way we think about our portfolio. I'll give you two illustrations, prior set, current set. Aiding our customers with highly transparent consumer friendly decision support tools around cost and quality, quite important to us. We've continued to evolve those tools and capabilities. We've been chosen by Consumer Reports and others as having the industry-leading tools relative to it, not just because of the data that's out there but the usability and the ability to influence decision-making. So that's kind of past current state. 2017, important launch for us. In the first quarter of 2017 we launched a new program and service that does exactly what you're describing. It's known as Cigna One Guide. It's a multichannel, multi-modal engagement capability that allows the direction that you just articulated but also has a learning dimension that's built into it with smart algorithms to provide next-best decision support, next-best recommendations. It also has the ability to integrate between the consumer or the individual with our service professionals and our clinical professionals. And we see the opportunity to integrate that further in our health care collaboratives going forward. So it's quite exciting. By order of magnitude and scale, we're already servicing 1.5 million customers. With that platform it'll rapidly ramp to over 5 million customers. So indicative of the journey we're on to the prior conversation relative to the customer NPS consumer centricity. These are just two examples of investments in customer-oriented capabilities to better engage and support them; and very importantly where possible, integrate them with the health care professionals so there could be a similar level of insights going forward. So expect to see more from us even on a go forward basis. Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : And thank you, Mr. Baker. I would like to turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Thank you, everyone. So just to wrap up our call, I'd like to highlight a few key points from our discussion. We began 2017 with strong momentum and have increased our outlook for the full year. We reported strong revenue growth with earnings growth across each of our business segments and strong customer growth. We remain committed to achieving our long-term average annual EPS growth rate of 10% to 13%. We're confident in our ability to deliver our increased 2017 outlook of 15% to 20% earnings growth, and we're further strengthened by our significant capital position and our capacity for meaningful capital deployment. Our efforts to improve the health and lives of our customers in the communities we work and live in and play in around the world are driven daily by the talented and dedicated Cigna team. And lastly, we thank you for joining our call today and we look forward to our future conversations. Have a great day.

Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by for Cigna's second quarter 2017 results review. At this time, all callers are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter queue to ask a question at that time. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell. William McDowell - Cigna Corp.: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's second quarter 2017 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2017. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders' net income, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2017 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover one item pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. In the second quarter, we recorded an after-tax benefit of $47 million or $0.18 per share for merger-related income tax benefits net of transaction costs, and we reported this net benefit as a special item. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of financial results. Also, consistent with past practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior-year development of medical costs. With that, I will turn the call over to David. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Thanks, Will. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. I'll begin my comments by highlighting Cigna's second quarter operating results, which reflect strong execution and continued momentum across our portfolio of businesses. Then I'll describe how our recently evolved strategy of Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond guides our focus on the multiple avenues we have for attractive long-term growth. As part of our discussion, I'll highlight some of the examples of growth opportunities we are pursuing across our global markets. I'll then turn the call over to Eric for a more detailed overview of our second quarter results as well as our increased outlook for full year 2017. And then following our Q&A, I'll wrap up the call with a few closing comments. I'll start with this quarter's operating results. In the second quarter, we continued our momentum with organic earnings growth in all of our reporting segments. Consolidated revenue increased to $10.3 billion. And we grew earnings to $750 million, or $2.91 per share, with significantly increased bottom line contributions from each of our businesses. Turning to the segments, in Global Health Care, we posted another quarter of strong earnings growth, and our unique approach to engagement and incentive alignment continues to generate high-quality clinical outcomes and competitively differentiated medical costs. Our Global Supplemental Benefits business had another outstanding quarter, and we continue to innovate with solutions and distribution approaches that enable us to address the evolving health and sense of security needs of individuals in our targeted geographies around the world. And our Group Disability and Life business delivered strong results, specifically in disability, where our clinical resources and productivity model continues to generate improved return-to-work results, which benefit our customers and our employer clients. Collectively, these results coupled with our significant ongoing free cash flow and exceptional capital position give us confidence we will achieve our increased 2017 EPS outlook of $9.75 to $10.05 per share. As we discussed at our Investor Day in June, to further accelerate our strategic journey as a global health service company, we've taken our successful Go strategy to the next level, building on our differentiated results over the past seven-plus years, a timeframe where we delivered 11% compounded annual growth rate for revenue, 12% for EPS, and an average annual TSR of 34%. Our evolved strategy of Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond serves as a guide to achieving the right balance of affordability and personalization, which we will deliver by being the undisputed partner of choice, accelerating the next generation of integration, and making the complex simple for the benefit of our customers. The Go Deeper and Go Local dimensions of our strategy will drive opportunities for Cigna to capture meaningful growth in our targeted businesses and guide us to expand our capabilities and pursue targeted additional adjacencies. Today I'll highlight four areas where we see significant headroom opportunities for growth. I'll briefly touch upon employer clients with up to 500 employees, our voluntary solutions, Medicare Advantage, and our international markets. Beginning with employer clients with up to 500 employees, increasingly we see these employers are eager to benefit from proven market innovations, including greater choice of transparent affordable solutions to help enable a more productive workforce. They're also seeking health engagement capabilities such as onsite biometric screening, health coaching, and innovative clinical programs. Cigna is uniquely positioned to expand and add to these relationships. Our consultative approach, our investments to expand our capabilities, and our flexible and innovative offerings such as One Guide are very responsive to the emerging needs of these clients. Next, we also see significant growth potential for our differentiated portfolio of voluntary solutions, as individuals are increasingly empowered to make more personalized choices through their employers relative to their specific benefits that best meet their personal needs at a given life or health stage. We view the $8 billion group supplemental market and specifically accident indemnity, critical illness, and hospital care as complementary to our medical and disability offerings, and as such a large growth opportunity for us. Today we are well positioned with a range of distribution, products, and consumer insight capabilities. In addition, we have proven capabilities in the supplemental market through our successful Global Supplemental Benefits business across the globe. Next, relative to Medicare Advantage, there is an increasing understanding and appreciation for the ability of these programs to meet the health and wellness needs of the rapidly growing seniors population in the U.S. We deliver significant value to seniors through deep physician partnerships and coordinated approaches to care, each of which are aided by our proven approach to incentive alignment. When you combine this with the effectiveness of Cigna's HealthSpring differentiated value proposition, which is a deeply rooted value-based care series of programs, we see the U.S. seniors marketplace as a tremendous growth opportunity, both in our existing as well as new markets. As a final example, we see meaningful growth opportunities in our targeted international markets. The global health marketplace is large, complex, and changing rapidly, which provides us with potential for attractive growth and ongoing value creation. In each of our international businesses, specifically Global Supplemental Benefits and Global Health Benefits, Cigna brings decades of local experience and expertise in delivering health, well-being, and sense of security solutions to both individual customers and employer clients. I'll begin with comments on our Global Supplemental Benefits business. We see considerable opportunities for continued growth in our Global Supplemental Benefits business, where today we serve approximately 13 million customer relationships and where we have grown revenue at a compounded annual rate of 18% since 2009. In terms of market opportunities, the middle class in Asia alone is expected to continue to grow by 9% annually through 2030, with even higher growth rates anticipated in countries such as China, India, and Indonesia, where we already have a strong foothold. We recognize that innovative distribution is critical to meeting the diverse and emerging needs of this population. For example, over the past several years, we have broadened our distribution channels from what was primarily outbound telemarketing to new capabilities such as direct-to-consumer channels, including direct-response TV, online, and face-to-face sales, particularly in branches of local banking partners. Further driving demand, medical costs are outpacing inflation globally, meaning health protection gaps will continue to rise. The health coverage gap across the Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow to $200 billion by the year 2020, and Cigna is well positioned to deliver solutions to meet the needs of individuals most impacted by this gap. Relative to global health benefits, Cigna is the leading provider of health benefits to the globally mobile population today, with a range of solutions for medical, dental, and pharmacy to behavioral, life and long-term disability benefits. We're deepening our solution suite to offer clients an even more flexible range of benefits that can be customized to meet the complex needs of the globally mobile population. We're further driving growth by expanding our global medical and healthcare provider networks and investing in care management and coordination capabilities which leverage global best practices. Taking all of this into consideration, Cigna is well positioned to capture further headroom in our existing international businesses as well as expand our capabilities through continued product, service, and distribution innovation. Before I close my remarks, I'd also note how closely tied to our Go Deep and Go Local proposition is our Go Beyond proposition, which further differentiates the services, capabilities, and experiences we deliver as well as our social impact. I'll share two brief examples, the first being our early adoption Net Promoter Score, or NPS, to improve the customer experience, and the second being our commitment to making an even greater social impact for our local communities around the world, where as we know, social programs designed to promote health and well-being too often leave gaps for local communities. Approximately five years ago, we were the first in our industry to see Net Promoter Score as a more effective way to understand the loyalty and emerging needs of customers and to drive targeted service and program innovations from those insights. Examples of our innovations include One Guide in the United States, which is already serving nearly 2 million customers, as well as our recently introduced global Wellbeing app, which will be available to customers across the globe. Further ongoing emphasis on community involvement guides Cigna's actions, such as stepping up to the void in the United States relative to the opioid epidemic. Here, we are already seeing meaningful progress toward our goal to reduce the use of opioid pharmaceuticals amongst our customers by 25%. And we are serving as a convening force across the country for community, faith, law enforcement, and healthcare leaders. We're also deepening our work for the benefit of the veteran community, and we are furthering a range of community-based initiatives to help seniors in key geographies across the world. Taken together, our strategy of Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond will drive additional value creation for our customers, our clients, physician partners, and communities, and as a result for our shareholders. Now to summarize a few key points before I turn the call over to Eric. Cigna delivered strong second quarter results, with considerable strength across our portfolio of businesses, as we delivered organic earnings growth in each of our reporting segments. Our increased EPS range of $9.75 to $10.05 per share represents a growth rate of 20% to 24% over our 2016 results. Our strategy of Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond serves as a guide to our actions in order to deliver differentiated value for our customers and clients. We do this by achieving the right balance of affordability and personalization, which we seek to deliver by being the undisputed partner of choice, accelerating the next generation of integration, and making the complex simple for the benefit of our customers. In particular, the Go Deeper and Go Local dimensions of our strategy will drive opportunities for Cigna to deliver significant growth in each of our targeted businesses. And our performance momentum through the second quarter of 2017 coupled with our significant ongoing free cash flow and exceptional capital position give us confidence we will achieve our increased 2017 outlook. With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter 2017 results and provide an update to our full year outlook. Key financial highlights in the quarter are : consolidated revenue growth of 4% to $10.3 billion; consolidated earnings growth of 46% to $750 million, including significant earnings growth in each of our business segments; quarterly earnings per share growth of 47% to $2.91; and continued strong free cash flow and financial flexibility, with approximately $1.25 billion returned to shareholders through share repurchase on a year-to-date basis. Overall, the results in the quarter reflect the effective execution of our focused strategy and demonstrates the strong fundamentals of each of our operating businesses. The strength of these results provides us with continued momentum and confidence, reflected in our increased full year 2017 financial outlook. Regarding our business segments, I will first comment on Global Health Care. Second quarter premiums and fees in Global Health Care grew to $7.2 billion, driven by strong customer growth and specialty contributions across all commercial market segments and partially offset by the expected contraction in our seniors enrollment. We ended second quarter 2017 with 15.7 million global medical customers, an organic increase of 457,000 lives year to date. Second quarter earnings increased 22% to $591 million, reflecting growth in medical customers and specialty relationships, continued effective medical cost management, favorable prior-year reserve development, and operating expense discipline. Turning to our medical care ratios, our second quarter 2017 total commercial medical care ratio, or MCR, of 78.7% reflects the strong performance of our commercial businesses as well as favorable prior-year reserve development, offset by the impact of the health insurance tax moratorium. This result also reflects better than expected medical costs in our U.S. individual business and includes a favorable $4 million after-tax true-up related to risk adjustment balances for the 2016 policy year. Our second quarter 2017 total government MCR of 86.1% reflects the impact of our innovative physician engagement model within Medicare Advantage and favorable Medicare Part D experience. Second quarter 2017 Global Health Care earnings included favorable prior-year reserve development of $36 million after tax. Moving to operating expenses, for second quarter 2017, our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 19.9%, which reflects the impact of the health insurance tax moratorium, business mix changes, and continued effective expense management. Overall, we've had a very strong quarter in our Global Health Care business. Now, I will discuss the results of our Global Supplemental Benefits business, which David spoke about earlier. This business continues to deliver very attractive growth and profitability, as our customers continue to value the affordable and personalized solutions we deliver through an increasingly diverse and innovative set of distribution models. Premiums and fees grew to $914 million, an increase of 14%. Second quarter 2017 earnings grew 27% to $105 million, reflecting business growth, favorable claims experience in South Korea, and effective operating expense management. For Group Disability and Life, second quarter premiums and fees were just over $1 billion. Second quarter earnings in our group business were $83 million, with our life business performing as expected and disability results continuing to reflect a better than expected pace of improvement from the claims process modifications implemented last year. Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, our second quarter results reflect strong earnings contributions from each of our business segments. We also continued to generate very strong free cash flow from our businesses and maintained significant financial flexibility. Now I will discuss our increased outlook for 2017. In 2017, we expect to continue to deliver strong financial performance for our shareholders by leveraging our highly consultative approach that aligns affordable, personalized solutions to the needs of our clients and customers, continuing to invest to expand our capabilities and innovative offerings to better serve our customers and clients, and effectively deploying capital. For full year 2017, we continue to expect consolidated revenue to grow in the range of 3% to 4% over 2016 results, driven primarily by our strong growth in medical customers and specialty relationships. Our outlook for full year 2017 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $2.50 billion to $2.58 billion, or $9.75 to $10.05 per share. This reflects an increase of $0.20 to $0.40 per share over our previous expectations and represents per-share growth of 20% to 24% over 2016. I will now discuss the components of our increased 2017 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.14 billion. Key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2017 include the following. Regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect growth in the range of 500,000 to 600,000 lives over year-end 2016, reflecting the strong growth we have seen across our commercial market segments. Turning to medical costs, for our total U.S. commercial book of business, we now expect full year medical cost trends to be in the range of 4% to 5%, an improvement of 50 basis points over our previous expectations. Our industry-leading medical cost trend continues to reflect our collaborative relationships with providers, differentiated specialty integration model, and greater incentive alignment for our customers and clients, which result in positive health outcomes and better management of total medical costs. Now turning to our medical care ratio outlook, for our total commercial book of business, we continue to expect the 2017 MCR to be in the range of 80.5% to 81.5%, now with a bias towards the lower end of the range. For our total government book of business, we now expect the 2017 MCR to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5%, an improvement of 50 basis points versus our prior expectations. Regarding operating expenses, we continue to expect our 2017 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 20.5% to 21.5%. I would also note regarding our U.S. individual business, we continue to expect to report a loss for full year 2017, albeit at a lower level than previous expectations. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth, and now expect earnings in the range of $310 million to $330 million. This is an increase of $15 million over previous expectations, reflecting the strength of our second quarter results. Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we now expect full year 2017 earnings in the range of $260 million to $280 million, an increase of $20 million to $30 million over previous expectations, reflecting continued operational improvements in our disability business. Regarding our remaining operations, that is other operations and corporate, we now expect a loss of $170 million for 2017. So all in, for full year 2017, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.50 billion to $2.58 billion, or $9.75 to $10.05 per share. This represents an increase of $0.20 to $0.40 per share over our previous expectations. I'll also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior-year reserve development or of any future capital deployments. Now moving to our 2017 capital management position and outlook, overall, we continue to have excellent financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with a strong return on capital in each of our business segments, and we have significant free cash and leverage capacity available at the parent company. Our capital deployment strategy and priorities remain : first, funding our businesses to support long-term growth; next, pursuing M&A activity, with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow in our targeted areas of focus; and lastly, after considering these first two items, we would return capital to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase. Regarding free cash flow, we ended the second quarter with parent company cash of approximately $2.2 billion. And after considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we continue to expect to have approximately $5 billion of parent cash available for deployment in 2017, reflecting strong ongoing free cash flows from our operating businesses and the after-tax impact of the break fee from the Anthem transaction. Further, we have the capacity to generate additional deployable cash by increasing our debt-to-capitalization ratio to the mid-30%, which we would consider a normal range going forward. These components would bring us to $7 billion of potentially deployable cash in 2017, with additional incremental leverage capacity to raise the debt-to-capitalization ratio to the low to mid-40% in consideration of strategic M&A opportunities. During the period from May 5 through August 3, we repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares of stock for $910 million, bringing our year-to-date share repurchase to approximately 7.7 million shares of stock for $1.25 billion. As we have noted previously, we intend to complete at least $2 billion in share repurchases by the end of this year. Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from industry-leading margins and returns on capital in our businesses and the high level of capital efficiency, particularly from our fee-based businesses. Now to recap, our second quarter 2017 consolidated results reflect the strength and momentum in our diversified portfolio of global businesses and continued effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by these results, which reflected strong revenue and earnings contributions from each of our business segments, industry-leading medical cost trends and high clinical quality, and continued strong free cash flow. Based on the strength of these results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year 2017 earnings outlook. With that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : The first question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup. You may ask your question. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. So you have the 10% to 13% long-term growth estimate, and you talked at the Investor Day about more accelerated growth, at or maybe above the high end of the range. So I guess \u2013 I know you're not going to give 2018 guidance, but can you maybe just frame into 2018 some of the positives and drags you see relative to that growth estimate that you have for next year? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Ralph, good morning. It's David. Thank you. As you said, it's early for 2018 guidance, so we're not going through the individual components. Let me try to give you just a little color relative to that, all taken against the backdrop, as you said, at our Investor Day, we remain committed to the 10% to 13% long-term EPS growth rate and our strategic objectives to achieve the $16 of EPS out in 2021. First, as you think about starting any given year, so as we talk about 2018, I would remind you that we always start a year and plan for a year assuming that there will be no prior-year reserve development. So put that back in context, as you know, we have a lot of \u2013 $100 million after tax of prior-year reserve development in 2017. So we would start viewing that as a zero going into 2018. The macro headlines I'd ask you to think about off of that is very strong momentum off of the core business in 2017, which really is important when you're projecting forward. To be clear, we would expect to grow revenue as well as earnings off of our 2017 base. As noted by Eric, we have a great track record of producing very strong cash flows. We expect that to continue in 2018 as well as to maintain a very strong capital position. So we look forward to carrying the momentum out of 2017 into 2018 with good top line and bottom line growth, noting that the prior-year reserve development would be something we would always plan for and project at zero. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. And then just to follow up, I wanted to go to the Global Supplemental business margins were really strong this quarter. Anything to call out there, how sustainable is it? And then you talked about the big opportunity. The segment right now is about 12% of earnings today. Any willingness to give us where you think that can go over the next handful of years as a percentage of the total business? Thanks. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Ralph, it's Eric. Just on the margins and such within the Global Supplemental Benefits business, overall, the Global Supplemental business has a great track record of strong revenue and earnings growth, and we're really happy with the results in the quarter. This quarter's results reflected the continued effect of strong growth. It reflected expense leverage as we continue to grow and get that expense leverage opportunity as well as a bit of favorable loss costs in Korea in particular. This business does have variation from period to period. It can exhibit variability from period to period and such, but this is a great quarter. In terms of the longer-term outlook, we continue to expect the long-term revenue growth in this segment to be in the mid-teens. And so you would expect it to grow as a portion of our enterprise over time. But again, we feel really good about the trajectory that we're on and the mid-teens growth rate in terms of the long-term outlook. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Ralph, to expand on the long-term outlook, clearly this business has, is, and will continue to grow at an organic rate faster than other aspects of our business. We feel great about the overall portfolio of businesses. This has a faster and more robust underlying growth rate. As such, if we were just to simply freeze for any M&A across the franchise, to your point, the percent of revenue to the enterprise, percent of earnings to the enterprise would continue to grow for this business as we look forward. And important to note, as we've discussed in the past, we continue to invest in and expand in capabilities, geographic footprint, talent, et cetera, to continue that growth momentum, so we have good optimism here to see it be a bigger part of the portfolio going forward. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. The next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. You may ask your question. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Hello, everybody. First, maybe just to ask, you're lowering the medical cost trend expectations again by 50 basis points. Your expectation was already the lowest in the industry or best managed in the industry, whatever way you want to describe it. I guess I would ask you first. What buckets are you seeing that are making you move this? Is this inpatient? What is it? And then more broadly, because it does seem like this quarter and following on the first quarter, the entire industry seems to be in another one of those periods where the cost trend and the MLR results and so forth are running better than expected. If you step back, is there some dynamic that you would point to at a macro level? Is it benefit design, high-deductible plans maybe that are having an impact, do you think, or is it medical cost management is taking another step forward? What would you say is driving why we're seeing everyone seemingly having a very good trend on the cost side? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: A.J., it's Eric. I'll start it off and then maybe ask David to fill in on some of the more macro comments on the back end here. First of all, we are really pleased with our medical trend results. We continue to build on the results that we've reported now for several years. A couple of comments I'd make, we entered the year with the expectation of 4.5% to 5.5%. And as you know, we lowered it to 4% to 5% in terms of the quarter. I think I talked on our call a quarter ago, we had expected each of the categories, inpatient, outpatient, professional, and pharmacy, to be in that low to mid-single-digits range, and that continues to be our expectation. It's just that each one of those are coming in a little bit lower in the range than we had previously contemplated. So overall, I feel really good about our ability to get to the 4% to 5% trend. And again, I'd note that that is something that's really fundamental in terms of the way that we deliver our overall value proposition to our clients. We think our trend result is driven by continued effective collaborative relationships, and again, overall the value of really good incentive alignment. But again, maybe, David, I'll ask you to take a more macro perspective. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: A.J., on the macro perspective, I think you make some very good observations, and specifically I'd highlight a few points. First, broadly speaking, I think when the industry is having this conversation and to the core of your question, it's really driven broadly speaking by the employer marketplace. And the good news is as you look over the last several years, the employer marketplace, while always has opportunities for improvement, has driven meaningful step-up in innovation. So where does the innovation come from? Improved incentive alignment. Where does the innovation come from? Evolution of clinical programs. Where is the innovation coming from? Beginning to explore across the industry more value-based programs, as have been proven in MA. Specific to Cigna, we've been deep into those areas for quite some time. And to the cornerstone of your comment, we're seeing a little bit bigger impact of those results on a sustainable basis. I'd also note finally, as we've discussed in the past, there's more adoption of transparent funding programs. That creates better alignment with employers. That helps to create better alignment with individuals, all of which help you get better engagement and better clinical outcomes. So net-net, we see it as a societal good to see this from an industry standpoint, and we're pleased from a Cigna standpoint our results are leading the pack relative to those engagement incentive-based outcomes. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. And if I can ask on my follow-up maybe, so now we have the lay of the land. You've had good success in mitigating some of the pressures on the Star Ratings for MA, and sanctions are behind you all. How fast should we think about your ability to get back on a growth trajectory and enrollment gains there? And if we're thinking the market is going to grow 6% to 8% enrollment on a steady-state basis, how quick can you get back maybe to market growth? Should we give that a few years, or are you more optimistic you can get there quicker? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: A.J., it's David. So first, we're quite pleased to come out of the sanctions process well in advance of the 2018 open enrollment cycle. Our team as we sit here today is actively enrolling for the remaining 2017 months and is highly focused and well prepared for a very successful open enrollment cycle this fall. And for 2018, I would just say very clearly, we expect to grow our MA portfolio. And I'd remind you that as you think about our proposition, we have a clear track record of consistent sustainable growth in our MA portfolio, which always starts with strong customer retention, and we're aided by those strong customer retention levels because of the fact that we have a high value-based penetration of our programs. 85% of all of our MA lives are in value-based programs. So to be really clear, we're active today. In the remaining 2017 months, the team is prepared and ready to roll for 2018, and we expect to grow. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rice. The next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, guys, nice quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the 2018 selling season and what you're seeing going on there? In particular, I'm referencing the return of the health insurance fee [HIF] and the impact that that's having on your risk-based business that you're selling, as well as the impact that it might be having on the uptake of alternative funding products that you sell. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Good morning. It's David. Let me give you a little bit of insight relative to the 2018 season. So I'll start with some color relative to the national account market, which is the most tangible market to speak to right now, given that it has a little bit broader selling cycle, and then give you a little bit of insight relative to your question on the HIF. First, relative to national accounts, I'd remind you that we define that segment a little differently than the industry. Specifically, when we refer to national, it's commercial employers with 5,000 or more employees in multiple states. Secondly, I'd just remind you our strategic goal has been to hold share from an aggregate standpoint but to deepen share with employers who value incentive and engagement-based programs, and then further deepen our relationship with our clients through leveraging our specialty and clinical programs. And I would note that 2017 has been a good year for that business segment. As it relates to 2018, what we've seen is that the RFP process, so the inbound opportunities for new growth opportunities, are up relative to 2016 meaningfully. I'd note that the 2016 volumes were low for the industry because there was a lot of industry disruption. But the 2018 volumes look a little bit more like 2016, and they're up meaningfully. To put that in context, the percent of our business that's out to bid is up a little bit, but nowhere near as meaningfully as the inbound opportunities. And we would expect as we look at 2018 to continue to have a very strong client retention rate. As it relates to broader purchasing trends, building on the prior comments, we continue to see across all segments high interest levels in incentive and engagement-based programs, which tend to leverage the transparent funding programs because they just create greater alignment with the employer, and as such, the individual customer employee, and enable you to get better mentally incentive alignment by targeted clinical programs, and we see that trend continuing. Lastly, as it relates to the HIF, the industry has a mechanism with which to previously pull out the pricing impact of the HIF and now put the pricing impact of the HIF back in. And we do not see a demonstrable change in purchasing patterns as it relates to guaranteed cost or transparent funding program as a result of that. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So pretty similar in terms of the EV uptake of the different products; it's not an acceleration or deceleration relative to the way it was last year, but this year? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Again, just putting it in context, we've seen a continued drumbeat of broader adoption of transparent funding programs across the marketplace, but we don't see that trend of acceleration changing. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Costa. The next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Could you just update us on when you are expecting to receive the termination fee from Anthem and the status of any litigation surrounding that? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Gary, good morning. It's David. As I think you know, that's currently in active litigation, and we don't typically comment on active litigation. So I'd like to leave it there. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And the origin of the tax gain you were able to book related to that, just a quick synopsis or summary again of what prompted that? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: I'll ask Eric to expand on that, but the tax gain is more broadly speaking relative to sun-setting the integration activity. Eric? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Gary, it's Eric. Specifically, the expenses associated with some of the integration work and such that we recorded as special items throughout the course of the pendency of the transaction, 2015 and 2016, those costs were not tax-deductible. Now that the Anthem transaction \u2013 the purchase \u2013 the merger agreement is closed and behind us, those costs became deductible, and so that is what generated the tax benefit. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Taylor. The next question comes from Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks, good morning. First question, just if you can, touch on the individual business and the better medical costs that you saw in the quarter, maybe a little bit on what you were seeing there. And then in terms of the margin profile, I know that you're still expecting a loss. But maybe you can give us a little indication of where the margin profile has changed relative to the prior view. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Sure, Scott. It's Eric. So overall, individual is a small business for us, as you know. As we noted in my prepared remarks, the first half results were a little bit better than we had expected. In particular, I would call out the solid performance from the markets where we've used our aligned collaborative models. As you might remember, we've talked in prior calls. We entered a couple of new markets this year. We changed the offerings we had in a couple of markets in terms of managing our footprint, and in particular drove our offerings around deep aligned collaborative models. And those models in particular are performing better for us. As you think about the full year expectation, this business does have a pretty pronounced seasonality. The deductibles in the plan design will drive higher costs over the back half the year, and that takes us to a small loss for 2017, be a better result than last year but a loss nonetheless. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it, and then the follow-up question just on MA. And we've certainly been hearing in other calls competitors citing how they're plowing some of the upside that they've been seeing in results and to investing a bit more on the MA side for growth next year. Maybe just talk about how you're thinking about investments for MA as a result of some of the favorable experience you've been seeing in what seems to be a pretty competitive environment for MA next year. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Good morning, Scott. It's David. First, just broadly speaking relative to investments, we have a long track record of a continued process of investing back into our portfolio of businesses, whether it be the healthcare business from a commercial standpoint, innovations like One Guide, whether it's the global business innovations like the global Wellbeing app, whether it's voluntary expansion within our group and our Health Care portfolio as well as MA. So broadly speaking, we just have a continued investment orientation within the portfolio. As it relates to MA, as I noted before, we would expect to grow our MA portfolio in 2018 organically. To be very clear, we did not expand geographically for 2018 because of the previous situation we were in. We would expect to resume our proven pattern of expanding geographies, both adjacent counties as well as new geographies as we look to 2019 and beyond, and we'll be updating you on those investments as we go forward. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fidel. The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, thanks. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on the MLR by the two divisions. I was a little bit surprised that you didn't lower the commercial MLR given that favorable development seems to be on that side and that's where you got 3R [risk adjustment, risk corridor, reinsurance] improvement. But you did raise in the government MLR, which seemed to me at least more in line with what we were expecting. So I was wondering if you could provide a little bit of color. Obviously, you are going to the low end of the commercial MLR range, but I would have thought maybe a reduction there. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: This is Eric, just a couple of comments I'd make on that. As you note, in terms of the commercial MLR, we are now focused on the lower end of our range of 80.5% to 81.5%, and that just really reflects the year-to-date cost and trend favorability. As you think about the back half of the year on the commercial loss ratio, I think there's some uncertainty around exactly how the individual business could perform in terms of closing out the year. I thought that it was prudent to continue to reflect the range of 80.5% to 81.5%. As you commented on prior-year development [PYD], year to date our prior-year development has been in the neighborhood of 60% commercial, 40% seniors, so it really has been split across all of our books of business. And as you know, the commercial book of business is quite a bit bigger than the seniors book of business. And so the impact of the experience we've had to date, the prior-year development moved the seniors loss ratio, the Medicare loss ratio, more significantly, and that's why we lowered that range. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. I thought in the quarter you said that it was mostly commercial, but you're saying the first quarter was mostly \u2013 there's more government that caused you to lower the government for the year? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: In terms of \u2013 the PYD was 60 :40 split over the course of the first half of the year. We didn't provide any particular color in terms of the driver of that or the breakdown of that for the quarter. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then I guess as far as the four growth drivers that you outlined earlier, were those listed in the order of importance, or is there some way to think about which one or two might be more important than the others? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Kevin, it's David. They were not in order of importance. We have a well-positioned portfolio of businesses with a number of growth opportunities. And those specific four growth opportunities we spent some time at our Investor Day and further embellishing on them, so we see step-function growth in those four categories. And again, you'll note the diversity of our portfolio enables us to have several unique growth opportunities that we're quite excited about. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right, thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. The next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. On the PYD, coming back to that for a second, I think you had, as you've said, just under $100 million. You've raised Health Care earnings year to date by I think about $45 million at the midpoint. I wanted to get your comments or color on whether some of that excess is going into reinvestment in the second half or how we should think about that relative to your earnings guide. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: David, it's Eric, just a couple of comments on that. We entered 2017 with good momentum in our Health Care businesses and increased the outlook a couple of times so far this year, so let's start with that. In terms of \u2013 we're pleased with the medical costs that they've developed favorably. And again, I think of that as being another hallmark in terms of the overall favorability we've had in medical cost trend. As we think about the balance of the year and the amount so far this year, a couple of dynamics I'd point to on that. One, I just mentioned a few minutes ago, caution in terms of the experience or the potential experience in the second half of the year related to the individual business. And second of all, you should expect that we're making adjustments in terms of the rate and pace of strategic investments and things along those lines in terms of the capabilities we've invested and deployed over the balance of the year. But now we feel good about the increase to the full year outlook and our position to achieve it. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Great, thank you. And then in the MA business, I'm curious if you could describe or even quantify the extent to which you're absorbing some negative leverage with the decline in membership this year, and with the return to growth next year how that might reverse. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: It's Eric. Without question, we did have a decline in revenue, and that has created some pressure. I don't think it's productive to isolate out a specific impact and such there, but you should think of us continuing to operate that business at an expense ratio that we think is attractive, a bit of room for improvement as we go forward and regrow into our long-term footprint. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Windley. The next question comes from Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. I just wanted to come back to Medicare Advantage really post the sanctions being lifted. I guess how quickly \u2013 and I don't even know if you can answer this definitively, but how quickly can you tell whether or not people are coming back to your business from direct marketing versus others in the market? Thanks. Like how much share are you gaining over the interim? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: It's David. I think we always start with our growth mantra for our corporation across the globe is retain-expand-add. So we start with the fundamental proposition that if you're delivering strong value to your customers, you should expect the ability to retain relationships at an elevated level. For the aspects of our business that we have the ability to expand the relationship through our specialty portfolio, et cetera, if we're delivering strong value and retaining on a targeted basis, we should be able to identify ways to further expand the value for our customers and clients and therefore expand relationships and targeted adds. As it relates to MA, that's really retention, in addition, with the process, so I would start with the notion of even during the sanction process, we were able to post a retention rate that was higher than others that have gone through the similar process. And I think that points back to, number one, the deep well-rooted physician partnership models and value-based relationships and strong service delivery, so that's the core. Two, to answer your question, we're selling in the marketplace right now and we're re-enrolling. And the pattern is evolving, so we're back in the market for July 1. We're able to test and see whether or not the momentum was manifesting itself, and we're in the market for August 1. We're able to manifest itself and we'll be in the market through the residual months of 2017. Secondly, we do know from some of our very well-developed physician engagement models, there's some high energy in those markets and with seniors coming into our program. So we would expect to step into 2018 with net growth across this portfolio, and we don't believe we need a hiatus to re-manifest our growth objectives. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just a slightly different area here on capital deployment, you obviously want to emphasize growth areas, but obviously share repurchases are also an option. How do you decide as you move through the year when the M&A environment is just not going to manifest itself or you've spent enough on growth and then you want to switch over to share repurchase? I guess I'm just trying to think about the timing of when you would go back to a more aggressive posture on the share repurchase run. Thanks. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Hey, Chris. It's David. Just again, to put the levers back in context, as Eric noted in his prepared remarks, our capital deployment priorities remain and are very clear : so support the ongoing needs of our growing businesses, and our growing businesses are supported by well-capitalized subsidiaries today; second, strategic and appropriately attractive M&A and third is share repurchase as a primary means of returning to our shareholders as we sit here today. As we've spent a good time on, we have meaningful capital deployment opportunities in front of us relative to current cash on hand as well as leverage capability, and that's both an exciting opportunity but a meaningful shareholder responsibility that we understand. I would note that there's not an or proposition. It's not like we have a date certain that we're going to shift from A to B. It's a dynamic portfolio management process, and I would guide you to just reflect back on over our last half a dozen-plus years. We have a proven track record of : A), not letting excess cash or capital sit idle for the benefit of shareholders; B), a very disciplined approach when we do engage in M&A online with our articulated M&A objectives; and over time a very balanced approach relative to M&A as well as share repurchase. In fact, if you look back over the last half a dozen-plus years, it's about 50 :50. To your point, it just happened in a little bit more lumpy fashion because of when the M&A opportunities present themselves. So net-net taken as a whole, significant shareholder value creation sits in front us relative to capital deployment, and we get that. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rigg. The next question comes from Jack Wang (52:47) with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, this is Justin Lake. Thanks, just one question. Just getting back to your Health Care performance in the quarter, your performance versus Street consensus and our number was $65 million \u2013 $75 million better in the quarter. Just curious how your performance looked versus your expectations. Were you mis-modeled a little bit, or was there that much upside and you're just reinvesting it back in the second half? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Justin, it's Eric, just a couple of comments on that. I think our expectations were a little bit higher than where the Street was at. And so again, there's an element of that. Overall, I'm really pleased with the favorability that we generated across each of the businesses. As you think over the balance of the year, the things that we're thinking about related to the back half of the year are just our updated assessment in terms of the seasonality. I've commented in terms of our caution in terms of the individual business, and that's continuing to make investments in capabilities that would advance the areas of focus, a couple of which David talked about in its prepared remarks. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Lake. The next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. You may ask your question. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Thanks, good morning. I wanted to follow up on the point around value-based care and you lowering the trend. Since this is a spread game, what kind of conversations are you having with the brokers and the benefit consultants? Are the employers now expecting lower rate increases for the remainder of this year and next year, or is it that your business is pretty differentiated around stop-loss or other specialty offerings, so it doesn't really feel as commoditized? What is it broadly for the industry? Are these MLRs going to keep going down? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Ana, good morning. It's David. You bridged two points. The value-based care component, so alignment with healthcare professionals to pay based on the quality of outcomes and the coordination of care, I would ask you to think about it two ways. One, very deep and broad relative to MA, 85% of all of our MA lives are in a value-based care program, deepening and evolving in the commercial space. So upside opportunities we look forward in the commercial space for sure. The reason why I reference that is in addition to that in the commercial space, what we've been able to do is advance significantly more on the demand side of the process, so individual incentive alignment, individual engagement, care coordination, navigation support, incentive alignment. When you take all those and put them together, as Eric noted, our commercial medical cost trend continues to track very favorably relative to any industry norm and continues to track favorably relative to our expectations in this year. Now to the clients, I'd remind you that 85% of our employer clients are in self-funded and fully transparent relationships. We like that because there's high levels of alignment, transparency, and visibility month to month, quarter to quarter, year to year, and they're seeing the benefit of this lower medical cost trend for their respective portfolio based upon the actions we're driving and continuing to drive for them. And of the residual 15%, that's split amongst experience-rated relationships where there's high transparency as well as guaranteed cost. And in guaranteed cost, if we isolate the 4% or so of our revenue that's on the individual exchange-based business because we don't play down-market under 50 employees, even those employers tend to be rated based on the credibility of their experience. My point is there's a high level of transparency and alignment with employers, and therefore we're aligned to try to get the right clinical programs moving forward, and we'll continue to drive this approach in 2018 and beyond. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Fair enough, okay. So following up on that on the specialty side for your ASO heavy book, can you give us a sense for if you increase your penetration as you've talked about voluntary and otherwise, what the potential target could be on the operating income and over what period of time that we can build into our growth forecasts? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Ana, it's David. I'm not sure I can give you a point estimate to build into your growth forecast. I'd bring you back a little bit to the time we spent on this topic at I. Day walking through some dimensions of the respective penetration levels that exist, and some headroom exists across our portfolio. So point one is we have headroom or additional penetration and growth opportunities across our portfolio. We don't view that as a static result because the dynamics of our employers' needs evolve. Secondly, as we've proven, we continue to innovate new programs and new services for the benefit of our clients, so we don't manage a static book. And thirdly, as I highlighted in my prepared remarks, we see the evolving employer voluntary marketplace as an additional growth opportunity. So as we talk about the retain-expand-add, the expand aspect of our growth strategy continues to have a lot of upside attractiveness both based on our existing specialty portfolio as well as evolved capabilities as we look forward. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks, David. I appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Gupte. Our last question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Can you speak to the atmosphere within your Medicare sales team? There was a period of disruption from the potential merger and the sanctions. So looking at the team now, how is morale and focus as we embark on returning to growth mode? And then was there any more turnover on the sales team over this period than normal? And also, how are you thinking about the marketing push this year compared to a typical year? Is there a step up in 2018 for marketing spend? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Sure, good morning. It's David. I appreciate the question very much. An important part of having a business that has disruption, how do you engage your team and keep them engaged, et cetera? So very importantly, we understood that coming into the sanction process, and my hat is off to our Medicare leadership team. They did a great job of having massive transparency with our colleagues across all aspects of the business, including sales, to your point. Too, our retention rates have been outstanding. We smartly redeployed a lot of the sales folks and growth-related folks in other aspects of the business. And I think we actually have a net benefit from that, if you look at the silver lining in the clouds, where skill sets and experiences have evolved because they've worked in other aspects of the seniors business over this disrupted timeframe. That team has been refocused now back on growing, as I noted before. We're actively in the small aspect of the 2017 process. The team has spent time together focused on the 2018 preparedness process, and they're ready to roll. That team is proud of the value proposition we deliver, and they're ready to roll to bring new programs and new relationships out to the seniors population to help change more lives. As it relates to the marketing spend, our team has been prepared, ready, focused on this, and they'll get the appropriate level of marketing support to make sure we're able to have the impact in 2018 we're looking forward to having. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you, Ms. James. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Cordani for closing remarks. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Thank you. Briefly, just to wrap up our call, I'd like to highlight some key points from today's discussion. In the second quarter, we continued our momentum with organic earnings growth in all of our reporting segments. These results coupled with our significant ongoing free cash flow and exceptional capital position give us confidence we will achieve our increased 2017 EPS outlook of $9.75 to $10.05 per share. To further accelerate our strategic journey as a global health service company, we've taken our successful Go strategy to the next level, building on our differentiated results over the past seven-plus years. Our evolved strategy of Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond serves as a guide to achieving the right balance of affordability and personalization, which we seek to deliver by being the undisputed partner of choice, accelerating the next generation of integration, and making the complex simple for the benefit of our customers. At Cigna, we have a team of 43,000 strong across the globe who wake up every day to serve and act as champions for our customers. Our team has proven time and again that they thrive in a dynamic and changing marketplace. We thank you again for joining our call today and look forward to our future conversations.

At this time, all callers are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter queue to ask questions at that time. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell. William McDowell - Cigna Corp.: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer and, Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's third quarter 2017 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2017. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders net income, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2017 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note in today's earnings release and in our most recent Reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, I note that in the third quarter, we recorded special item charges to shareholders net income totaling $214 million, or $0.85 per share, predominantly associated with the previously disclosed early extinguishment of debt. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of financial results. Also, consistent with past practices, when we make any perspective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior year development of medical costs. And with that, I will turn the call over to David. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Thanks, Will. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. I'll begin my comments by highlighting Cigna's third quarter operating results, which reflect continued strength across our portfolio of businesses, driven by our ongoing effective execution of our strategy. Then I'll briefly discuss a clear path for value creation grounded in each of our operating businesses, followed by a more detailed overview of the significant growth opportunities in our Commercial Employer business. I'll then highlight how Cigna's well performing businesses and strong free cash flow generation are providing us with ongoing financial strength and capital flexibility. And finally, I'll share some initial thoughts around expectations for 2018 before turning the call over to Eric for a more detailed overview of our third quarter results. Following our Q&A, I'll wrap up the call with a few closing comments. I'll start with our third quarter operating results. We achieved substantial earnings growth in the quarter, including continued momentum across each of our businesses. Our consolidated revenue increased to $10.4 billion and we grew earnings to $716 million or $2.83 per share, with significantly increased bottom-line contributions from each of our businesses compared to the third quarter of 2016. Turning to our segments. In Global Health Care, we continue to drive strong earnings growth and deepening our relationships with our customers, clients and healthcare delivery partners. Our Global Supplemental Benefits business posted another outstanding quarter of top-line and bottom-line results, which reflect continued progress in addressing evolved sense of security and health needs for our customers in targeted geographies around the world. And finally, our Group Disability and Life business also delivered solid performance this quarter, with strong fundamentals across both our Disability and Life portfolios. Collectively, these results, combined with our capital position and ongoing free cash flow generation, give us confidence we will achieve our increased 2017 outlook and enter 2018 with considerable momentum. Looking ahead, we continue to operate in a dynamic environment with an evolving marketplace characterized by aging populations, eroding health status, rapid technology innovation and a highly disruptive regulatory and legislative climate. Taken together, these dynamics will continue to create profound challenges and opportunities relative to the affordability of healthcare services across the globe and the ability to meet individual needs in a highly personalized way. In this disruptive environment, Cigna's strategy of Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond serves as our guide to value creation in each of our targeted growth platforms, including our Commercial Employer segment, which continues to present significant growth opportunities as we innovate solutions to meet market needs, more deeply integrate our medical and specialty offerings and deliver superior management of total medical costs and quality outcomes. Our U.S. Seniors business, which is positioned for growth in 2018 and over the long term by leveraging our best-in-class physician engagement model and a relentless focus on engaging our customers. Our Global Supplemental Benefits business, with sustained growth as we provide customers in key geographies with highly personalized, affordable health and sense of security solutions. And the Group Disability and Life segment, which drives profitable growth through our industry-leading productivity and asset management model, enabling our customers to avoid disability, or to maximize their return to work potential when disabilities do occur. Now I'd like to take some time to delve more deeply into our Commercial Employer business. We see outstanding opportunities for continued growth through a consistent focus on achieving the right balance of affordability and personalization. We seek to deliver this balance through three strategic imperatives. First, being the undisputed partner of choice, second, accelerating the next generation of integration and, finally, working to make the complex simpler for the benefit of our customers. An example of how we drive our role as undisputed partner of choice is by leveraging information, incentives and care resources to help healthcare professionals better align around value-based care models and to deliver a differentiated, more coordinated approach to care. We currently have advanced collaborative relationships with nearly 390 physician groups and hospitals spanning 34 states. We have built strategic flexibility into our platforms and our willingness and ability to meet our providers where they are enable us to deploy a variety of collaborative arrangements and models with physician groups and hospitals. These relationships help us by leveraging data and insights to identify health risks earlier as we provide timely analysis on insured patients and customers who our predictive models identify as being higher risk for decreased health status and emerging health challenges. In fact, recently Cigna was the only national health plan to earn the National Committee for Quality Assurance's Physician and Hospital Quality Certification. This recognition is one of many that reinforces our ongoing commitment to effectively partner to make sure that Cigna customers receive the right care, the right service and the best value. I would also note that our success here in part helps to drive higher level of client persistency, as well as improved quality of care and, as a result, total lower medical costs. At the same time, we deploy an integration model in our Commercial Employer business that goes well beyond traditional cross-selling and solutions bundling. It's based on a consultative approach, allowing us to leverage the combined data and insights from across our solutions to improve outcomes for the benefit of our customers and clients. We've demonstrated that customers with integrated Cigna medical and pharmacy solutions are more active in health coaching and case management programs than those engaged in medical-only benefits. And our customized programs have generated significant annual medical cost savings for customers who engage with us in one or more health improvement coaching or counseling services. The health impact and resulting savings from these programs are just one example of how Cigna continues to deliver industry-leading medical cost trend. Further illustrating the value of our integrated solutions, we have seen that among our commercial clients who benefit from three or more Cigna solutions, we are delivering retention rates that are 3% to 5% higher than those with standalone medical services. And while these results are market differentiated, as we've discussed before, we have additional opportunity to further deepen our client relationships across our buying segments. We are also accelerating our next generation of integration by delivering services through a variety of means, be it digital, face-to-face or otherwise, to better engage the individual in a highly personalized way. When combined with deep value-based relationships with healthcare professionals, we see our approach to next-generation integration as a further step in continuing to deliver differentiated value and our market-leading medical cost and quality outcomes. Finally, we strive to simplify the complexity in healthcare for the benefit of our customers, clients and partners through ongoing innovation and differentiated capabilities. To share just a few examples. First, we remain the only health service company to offer live access to call service representatives, 7/24, 365, to be there when our customers or partners need us. Second, we continue to embed and integrate care extenders, such as nurses and care coordinators, into the practices of hundreds of our collaborative partners across the country. And, third, we actively work to improve the customer experience through new technologies and digital enablement, such as One Guide, which helps our customers to make more informed choices as they select their benefits, better manage their cost of care through price transparency and reward program participation and make it easy for them to create and connect a personalized team of doctors, coaches and clinicians, how and when they choose. Today, in only our first year since launch, we already have 2 million customers on One Guide and we expect to double this to 4 million customers in 2018. These examples underscore how Cigna is continuing to deliver differentiated value to enhance personalization and affordability. Now as we look across the Cigna enterprise, we recognize that the differentiated value we deliver in the marketplace directly contributes to our company's financial strength and flexibility. Our exceptional capital position today and continued strong free cash flow that our operating businesses are generating enable us to both continue to reinvest back in our business to drive continued growth and expand the solutions for our customers and clients and strategically position Cigna for the long-term growth by pursuing attractive, inorganic opportunities to further develop capabilities aligned to evolving marketplace needs as well as to effectively return excess capital to shareholders. With respect to our initial outlook for 2018, the headline is we expect to deliver attractive financial performance again in 2018. We will continue to organically grow our business in terms of revenue, earnings and customers over our increased 2017 outlook, driven by our four well-positioned growth platforms, a clear, compelling strategy and outstanding talent deployed across the globe. We expect to continue to generate strong margins and cash flows, which will further fuel our capital deployment opportunities. I would also remind you that when we provide guidance for 2018, we will exclude the impact of any prior year development or future capital deployment as we have done in the past. Now to summarize a few key points before I turn the call over to Eric. We have achieved substantial earnings growth in the third quarter, with continued momentum across our portfolio of businesses, giving us confidence will achieve our increased 2017 outlook. In a disruptive environment, our recently evolved strategy of Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond serves as our guide to achieving the right balance and affordability and personalization, which positions us well in each of our growth platforms, Commercial Employer, U.S. Seniors, Global Supplemental Benefits and Group Disability and Life. We remain well positioned for growth across our portfolio in 2018 and over the long term, which is even further strengthened by our strong capital position. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Eric. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter 2017 results and provide an update to our full-year outlook. Key financial highlights in the quarter are consolidated revenue growth of 5% to $10.4 billion, consolidated earnings growth of 42% to $716 million, including significant earnings growth in each of our business segments, quarterly earnings per share growth of 46% to $2.83, and continued strong free cash flow and financial flexibility, with approximately $2.3 billion returned to shareholders through share repurchase on a year-to-date basis. Overall, the results in the quarter reflect the effective execution of our focused strategy and demonstrate the strong fundamentals of each of our operating businesses. The strength of these results provide us with continued momentum and confidence reflected in our increased full-year 2017 financial outlook. Regarding our business segments, I will first comment on Global Health Care. Third quarter premiums and fees in Global Health Care grew 6% to $7.2 billion, driven by strong customer growth in specialty contribution across all commercial market segments and, as expected, this growth was partially offset by lower Seniors enrollment versus the prior year. We ended third quarter 2017 with 15.8 million Global Medical customers, an organic increase of 619,000 lives year-to-date. Third quarter earnings increased 38% to $575 million, reflecting growth in medical customers and specialty relationships, continued effective medical cost management and operating expense discipline. Turning to our medical care ratios. Our third quarter 2017 total Commercial Medical Care Ratio, or MCR, of 78.6% reflects the continued effectiveness of the medical cost management capabilities David discussed earlier, partially offset by the impact of the Health Insurance Tax suspension. This MCR also reference better-than-expected medical costs in our U.S. Individual business. Our third quarter 2017 total government MCR of 84% reflects the impact of our innovative physician engagement model within Medicare Advantage and favorable Medicare Part D experience. Third quarter 2017 Global Health Care earnings included favorable prior-year reserve development of $19 million after tax. Moving to operating expenses. For third quarter 2017, our total Global Healthcare operating expense ratio was 21.1%, which reflects the impact of the Health Insurance Tax suspension, business mix changes and continued effective expense management. Overall, we've had a very strong quarter in our Global Health Care business. Turning now to Global Supplemental Benefits, our third quarter results reflect continued attractive growth and profitability, as premiums and fee grew to $937 million, an increase of 12%, and third quarter 2017 earnings grew 35% to $109 million, reflecting business growth, favorable claims experience in South Korea and effective operating expense management. For Group Disability and Life, third quarter premiums and fees were just over $1 billion. Third quarter earnings in our Group business increased 38% to $73 million, reflecting favorable claims experience in both our Disability and Life businesses. Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, our third quarter results reflect strong earnings contribution from each of our business segments. We also continued to generate very strong free cash flow from our businesses and maintain significant financial flexibility. Now I will discuss our increased outlook for 2017. For full-year 2017, we now expect consolidated revenues to grow by approximately 4% over 2016, driven by strong growth in medical customers and specialty relationships as we continue to more deeply integrate our solutions and generate greater value for customers and clients and continued momentum in Global Supplemental Benefits as we innovative with new solutions across a diverse set of distribution platforms. Our outlook for full-year 2017 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range approximately $2.6 billion to $2.65 billion, or $10.20 to $10.40 per share. This reflects an increase of $0.35 to $0.45 per share over our previous expectation and represents per-share growth of 26% to 28% over 2016. I will now discuss the components of our increased 2017 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We now expect full-year Global Health Care earnings in the range of $2.14 billion to $2.17 billion. Key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2017 include the following. Regarding Global Medical customers, we now expect an increase of approximately 650,000 lives over year-end 2016. This is an increase of approximately 100,000 lives from the midpoint of our previous expectations and reflects targeted growth across all commercial market segments. Turning to medical costs. For our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we now expect full-year medical cost trends to be in the range of 3% to 4%, an improvement of 100 basis points over our previous expectations. Our industry-leading medical cost trend continues to reflect benefits from increased incentive alignment for our customers and clients, deeper collaborative relationships with providers and our differentiated specialty integration model, all of which contribute to positive health outcomes and better management of total medical costs. And as a reminder, given that 85% of our U.S. Commercial enrollment is in transparent ASO funding arrangements, Cigna's multi-year track record of leader on medical cost trends results directly benefit our clients. Now turning to our Medical Care Ratio outlook. For our total commercial book of business, we now expect the 2017 MCR to be in the range of 80% to 81%, an improvement of 50 basis points versus our prior range. Consistent with past years, our outlook anticipates a sequentially higher fourth quarter MCR, due to an increased seasonal impact from the growing share of high deductible plans in our Employer, Group and Individual businesses. For our total Government book of business, we continue to expect the 2017 MCR to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5%, with a bias toward the low end of that range. Regarding operating expenses, we now expect our 2017 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be approximately 21%. I would also note, regarding our U.S. individual business, we now expect full-year 2017 results to be slightly profitable. For our Global Supplement Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top-line growth and now expect earnings in the range of $345 million to $355 million. This is an increase of $25 million to $35 million over previous expectations, reflecting the strength of our third quarter results. Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we now expect full-year 2017 earnings in the range of $275 million to $285 million, an increase of $5 million to $15 million over previous expectations, reflecting strong third quarter results. And regarding our remaining operations, that is Other Operations and Corporate, we now expect a loss of $160 million for 2017. All-in for full-year 2017 we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.6 billion to $2.65 billion, or $10.20 to $10.40 per share. This represents an increase of $0.35 to $0.45 per share over our previous expectations. I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior-year reserve development or any future capital deployment. Now moving to our 2017 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have excellent financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent. Each of our business segments has a strong return on capital and we maintain significant free cash and leverage capacity at the parent company. Our capital deployment strategy and priorities remain, first, funding our businesses to support long-term growth, next, pursuing M&A activity with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow in our targeted areas of focus, and, lastly, after considering these first two items, we will return capital to shareholders primarily through share repurchase. Regarding free cash flow, we ended the third quarter with parent company cash of approximately $1.7 billion and we have the capacity to generate additional deployable cash by increasing our debt-to-capitalization ratio to the mid-30%s, which we would consider a normal range going forward. Regarding share repurchase, during the period from August 4 through November 1, we repurchased 5.5 million shares of stock for approximately $1 billion, bringing our year-to-date share repurchase to 13.2 million shares of stock for approximately $2.3 billion. Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from industry leading margins and returns on capital in our businesses and a high level of capital efficiency, particularly from our fee-based businesses. Now to recap. Our third quarter 2017 consolidated results reflect strength and momentum across our diversified portfolio of global businesses and continued effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by these results, which reflected strong revenue and earnings contribution from each of our business segments, industry-leading medical cost trends with our clients directly benefiting from increased levels of incentive alignment, physician collaboration and specialty integration and continued strong free cash flow. Based on the strength of these results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full-year 2017 earnings outlook and are well positioned for attractive earnings growth in 2018. And with that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Mr. Lake, your line is open. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate all the color. Wanted to first touch on your 2018 comments, David. You talked to being able to grow revenue net income year-over-year versus your 2017 revised guidance. Just want to first make sure that is the way to think about this, right, versus let's just say the 26%, 25% mid-point of net income, do you expect to be able to grow off of that? And then you talked about attractive growth. Is it, in your mind, a typical growth year off that number, or is there a reset we should be thinking about in terms of the upside this year? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Good morning. It's David. Let me provide some color and framing for 2018, then I'll ask Eric to embellish a little bit with some of the specifics of the numbers. First, by way of a backdrop. First, we're really pleased with the 2017 outlook and the momentum we've built and our ability to yet again increase our full-year outlook. And as Eric noted, it has an embedded growth rate in it of 26% to 28% from an EPS perspective. Second, specifically to the headline for 2018, as you articulated, we will again grow our top and bottom line. That's correlated to the four well-positioned growth platforms we have. At a macro level, think about the drivers as being further revenue and customer growth, further deepening our customer and client relationships by leveraging our both diverse and growing specialty portfolio as well as further expense leverage. Now, while we won't go through the detail of our 2018 guidance until the fourth quarter call, we want to give you a little bit more color. So, when you consider that 2017 jump off and the macro drivers I identified, we expect to grow our organic earnings in the range of 7% to 9% when you adjust 2017 for prior-year reserve development, as we always do. Now that 7% to 9% is in line with our strategic goal and objective. I would also note that that outlook, from our point of view, is competitively attractive and it contemplates as well as offsets the headwind that is created from the return of the industry. So, said otherwise, even with the return of the industry, we expect to grow organic earnings consistent with our strategic range of 7% to 9% when you exclude prior-year reserve development. Lastly, I would remind you, as you know, we have both an exceptional capital position and we don't project future capital deployment. That presents additional opportunity for shareholder value creation for us. I'll ask Eric to just reinforce few of the numbers behind that. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Yeah, Justin. It's Eric. So, as David said, I think we're really pleased with the momentum that we've carried through 2017. And our 2017 guidance for income of $2.6 billion to $2.65 billion represented really strong growth over 2016. And as David noted, when we provide guidance, and have for some time, we always exclude, and we do so on a basis that excludes prior-year reserve development and excludes any potential future capital deployment. So, if you take the 2017 number and remove the impact of prior-year development, our 2017 guidance on a similar basis would be $2.485 million to $2.535 million (sic) [$2.485 billion to $2.535 billion] (28:38) in income and off of that base, we'd expect to generate income growth consistent with our long-term averages. The range that David talked about and that we've talked about even at our Investor Day would be a long-term average of 7% to 9%. And so we'd expect to grow consistent with that range. There's a number of headwinds and tailwinds. We're not going to enumerate all of those in the course of the call today. We'll do so at our fourth quarter call, when we provide more detailed guidance. But as David said, notably, we'd expect to deliver results in that range and that's inclusive of the Industry Fee return, which is definitely a headwind. We think the timing dynamics associated with the commercial portion of the Industry Fee as being worth something like $50 million year-on-year and that'd be a headwind that we would work through in the course of achieving the results of that long-term growth range of 7% to 9% off of the basics including prior-year development. Hopefully that helps provide a little bit of color of how we're thinking about 2018 at this point. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : That was so helpful. I'm going to skip my follow-up and jump back in the queue. Thanks a lot, guys. I really appreciate it. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Mr. Fischbeck, your line is open. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : (30:00-30:09) William McDowell - Cigna Corp.: You have a bad connection. We're having trouble hearing you. Operator : Our next question will be from Matt Borsch with BMN (sic) [BMO] (30:25) Capital Markets. Mr. Borsch, your line is open. Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. It's actually BMO. So, I just wanted to ask a question about, you touched on enrollment growth expected for 2018. Can you give us any thoughts on how you think the employer renewals and account wins and losses are shaping up for January 1? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Sure, Matthew. Good morning. It's David. Let me give you a little bit of color. As we first, big picture, as we look to 2018, we expect, again, to grow our customer lives, therefore, our revenue. And quite importantly, we expect to, again, further deepen our relationships by leveraging our growing and well-positioned Specialty portfolio. As we look to 2018, we would expect the bulk of our growth to continue to be driven by our Select and Regional segment. Specifically, this time of the year we typically talk with you about the National segment, so a little bit more color there. To remind you, we define the National Commercial segment a little bit differently than the industry. So it's commercial employers with 5,000 or more employees that span multiple states. Relative to that marketplace for 2018, we would expect to have another year of strong client retention, underscoring our medical cost delivery, our service delivery, et cetera. We would expect to have some targeted wins in terms of new business growth. And net-net, we're expecting to step into the year for the National segment with stable membership for National, growing membership for Select, as we have in the past, growing membership for Regional, net-net overall for Commercial business growing membership as we step into 2018. Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And if I could just add a follow-on to that, which is, what are you seeing in terms of the employer preferences for products if you can make a generalization across the broad landscape there? I mean, for example, is there cost \u2013 high-deductible conversions and cost sharing, is that decelerated because of the strong economy and tighter labor market or not? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Matthew, I appreciate the prompt for the additional color. I would say the push for value is as intense as it's ever been. Employers are seeking to get more value or higher return from their overall benefits portfolio and investment. As such, we see employers at all sizes more open to and more aggressively evaluating not just transparent funding mechanisms, but as we described, incentive and engagement based programs that are quite targeted to get more engagement of their individual employees and family members into the active health management, into the active engagement, into the predictive indicators, et cetera. And if there's a trend that I would identify that's emerging on the more accelerated basis, which we think is positive, it's the push for more localized variance. So, you'll recall our strategy; topic two is Go Local. As the market evolves for more value-based arrangements, it's happening unevenly around the country, and employers are more open to buying or configuring local variations that get the best of the value-based collaboratives, we're well-positioned for that. We think that's a very positive direction for employers. So less on the CDHP side and more directed toward more value-based programs, higher engagement-based programs, more leverage of incentives and increasingly more local variation. Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Our next question will come from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open, sir. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Sorry about that. So, I guess can you talk a little bit about you mentioned that you expect MA membership growth next year in addition to the long-term growth. Can you give a little bit of color on how you're feeling your bids are positioned for 2018? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Good morning, Kevin. Can hear you a lot clearer. Thank you. So, specific to MA, broadly we continue to see the U.S. Seniors market as an attractive growth platform. That's driven by a variety of forces. First, at a macro level, the demographics, as well as, importantly, the real strong value proposition MA provides the seniors relative to fee-for-service in many markets. Specific to Cigna, we overlay, in addition to that, our proven value-based collaboratives and then our innovative customer engagement programs. Not lost on us that we have been in a paused state relative to the marketplace for a couple years. As we step into 2018, we will grow. We'll grow revenues and we'll grow customers despite that disruption and noting that strategically we're exiting some targeted counties in 2018 and not entering new geographies. So, taken as a whole, our read of 2018, we will grow, albeit our underlying expectations for 2018's customer growth is lower than our historical run rate in this business and we're projecting for lower-than-market-average growth because, in part, we're reentering the market, we're exiting some counties and we didn't enter any new counties or new markets for 2018. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Then I guess maybe if you could give some color on longer term, I guess maybe not specifically 2019, but longer term when you think about entering new markets, what kind of opportunity for growth is that? We heard other companies talk about significantly expanding their geographic coverage over the next several years. How do you think about that opportunity? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Kevin, we see that as a very attractive opportunity. We have had a disciplined process of organically opening up one to two markets per year prior to our structured pause that we were involved in. And we would expect to re-engage in that as we look at 2019 and beyond. Importantly, we have many markets where we have highly aligned well-performing collaborative and value-based relationships that are performing at high level for our commercial population, who those physician collaboratives and delivery system collaboratives desire us to be in the Medicare Advantage marketplace with them. So we have a lot of supply, if you will, or demand in the market depending on orientation. And as we look to 2019 and beyond, we see some really attractive growth opportunities, both in existing markets, but to your specific point, opening new markets for 2019 and beyond. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. I was just hoping to get some more color on the new medical cost trend outlook being down 100 basis points. Obviously, that's a fairly sizable decline relative to the prior outlook. What's the primary reason for the reduction there? Thanks. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Chris, it's Eric. Good morning. A couple of things that I'd share with respect to the medical cost trend. First of all, just stepping back, I would remind you within our book of business, 85% of the clients are in self-funded arrangements where the medical trend directly benefits the clients. And even the other 15% of the book of business that's in insured arrangement, much of that is in arrangements where the trend also directly impacts how we set the rates and things along those lines. And so, I mentioned that because I think the context of having the alignment of incentives provides that really important impact and effect in helping work to impact medical cost trend overall. Now, with respect to our lowered expectation of moving the trend to 3% to 4% for the full year, I would note a couple of dynamics. First of all, as you think about the specific categories, inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy and physician, each one of those different dimensions we would continue to expect to be in that low to mid-single digit range that I've referenced in prior calls. Within the quarter specifically, the areas that drove the improvement in results overall, I'd point to pharmacy and inpatient, in particular, now being lower in the range than they were previously. But in aggregate, continue to expect each one of those categories to be in that low to mid-single digits range. And overall, we're really pleased with the overall impact that we're able to drive here. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And then just changing gears to Medicare Advantage. Can you give us a sense for how you think you're positioned for next year for growth and whether you think you'll be able to grow in line with the market or potentially even better given you've been out of the Annual Enrollment period for a while? Thanks. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Chris, it's David. As I briefly referenced in a prior question, our view is we're positioned to grow in 2018. We were back in the selling process in July, August, September, albeit small months, and were able to test the market from that standpoint. We had high alignment in demand with our physician collaborative projects in existing markets. Specific to 2018, we will growth revenue and we will grow customers. Our expectation is we will grow at a rate lower than the market average in 2018 for three reasons. One, we are reentering the market and we want to be honest relative to that process. Two, we've strategically exited some counties in 2018. And, three, we are not entering new markets in 2018. Even when you think all that together, we'll grow revenue and lives and position ourselves really positively to build off that momentum as we step into 2019 and revert growing at least in line with market average off our strong core and entering new markets in 2019 and beyond. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rigg, for your question. Our next question is from David Windley with Jefferies. Mr. Windley, your line is open. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. So, David, as you think about the evolving landscape on the pharmacy side, pharmacy benefit management and delivery channel chain, how do you characterize Cigna's cost position in Pharmacy? I'm thinking about beginning with Optum Rx's developments and continuing on the potential competitor of yours combining with the pharmacy. How do you consider Cigna's Pharmacy cost position? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Good morning, David. We have, for quite some time, viewed that the Pharmacy business, the integration of Pharmacy, the coordination of Pharmacy services, as quite an important part of our offering and our strategy. Today, we operate a high-performing innovative and importantly integrated Pharmacy business. We have a proven approach, with the ability on a targeted basis to partner with others to create even step functions of value of the benefit of our customers. And we continue to invest in capabilities in our Pharmacy business, technology, services, programs, as well as talent. As a result, our Pharmacy business unit continues to grow. As Eric previously referenced, we're delivering yet again another year of industry-leading medical cost trend. The Pharmacy component is a contributor to that. And we feel quite good about it. And as we look forward, we'll continue to invest both in technology capabilities and service expansions for our business. So net-net, we feel quite good about our positioning, the integrated approach. And we see further opportunities to both grow the business and drive further integration with our healthcare delivery partners. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Thank you for that. And then a quick follow-up on Medicare Advantage. You've commented on 2018. How do you think about investments that you might make in 2018 to help or bolster that business' position to grow in 2019, thinking particularly around mitigation around Stars (41:55)? Thanks. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: So, relative to the business portfolio and the platform, we feel good about the platform we carry into 2018. There's always an ongoing, we'll call it, investment portfolio in every one of our businesses, ongoing innovation and capabilities, be they service, program. In the case of MA, beyond that there are geographic expansions that we talked about as well. But we feel like we have the right portfolio of talent, technology, tools and a disciplined approach to continue to invest. And we like our positioning for 2018. We like our positioning to look to 2019 and beyond. And it will continue to be a growth platform for us. So I wouldn't say any massive inflection point change, nor an investment that is necessary in 2018 that would change our earnings trajectory for that business either. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thanks for the question. Our next question will be from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to focus on the Healthcare segment, specifically the International operations within there. I was just looking back, so I think that you guys' run rates are a $2 billion International Healthcare-specific business. And so as I look back to the growth rates, it really hasn't grown as fast or certainly not faster than the overall company. So I guess my question is really around strategic fit. And does this help with the domestic clients? Are there advantages that you see for running that business? And then has there been any thought around divesting it in light of some of the volatility that's been seen around currencies and really just revenues over the last several years? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Morning. It's David. A few questions embedded there. So, stepping back. First and foremost, we operate a diverse global platform of businesses. As you know, businesses that include highly innovative direct-to-consumer solutions, not the business you're making reference to. Secondly, a business portfolio that has comprehensive global and coordinated healthcare solutions for the globally mobile population. We sell that to commercial employers, IGOs, NGOs, et cetera. And then increasingly on a targeted basis, in-country healthcare coordination for the benefit of multi-national employer clients. Specific to your question, the Global Employer business has confronted a couple of years-plus of a meaningful customer and revenue headwind that has been on a sub-slice of the business that has dampened the revenue growth in that business. And it's specifically tied to the wind-down of the two wars that the U.S. has been involved in, obviously in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Defense Base Act. We were, and continue to be, a major supplier of services, service coordination and service delivery for those suppliers of resources that wrap around the war effort in terms of the contractors that wrap around that. As those wars have wound down, which is a net societal good, that business has dissipated massively. We've been able to offset that with fundamental growth but it has meaningfully dampened the net revenue growth of the business. And we see that chapter as having largely come to completion in terms of the dissipation of revenue. Lastly, we see this part of our business as leverageable for our global employers, and the vast majority of our employer clients are multi-national. And the vast majority of those employers are looking for additional solutions to either fill or supplement what different countries are affording on a go-forward basis. And we're well-positioned relative to that business, so we're excited about the growth opportunities looking forward. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research : All right. That makes a ton of sense. Is there a way to quantify the global employer portion of that $2 billion of annual revenues? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Josh, what we'll do is, we'll take that away and as we provide guidance for 2018 and beyond, we'll take away the challenge to embellish a bit further. But, as you'll note, our Global business in aggregate continues grow. You've mentioned FX as well. Within the Global Employer business, the FX kind of nets itself in a different way because we're matched globally relative to that business. But we'll take away the opportunity to provide you some more insights as we talk about our Commercial business on a go-forward basis. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research : All right. Perfect. Thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Raskin. Our next question will come from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Mr. Giacobbe, your line is open. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. David, you've talked about the $7 billion to $14 billion of deployable capital in the past and how you won't sit on it. So could you maybe just update us on timing or approach to M&A? Obviously, a lot of different headlines out there. How does or doesn't that impact your approach and timing? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Sure. Good morning, Ralph. So big picture, our capital deployment strategy and priorities have not changed. It's important to preface that with our current capital health and our projected capital health is a direct result of having well-performing businesses that are high margin and we have a successful track record of converting earnings to free cash flow as well as a disciplined capital management priority within the corporation. As you know, our priorities remain : ensure our businesses are well capitalized and supported for ongoing growth, pursue strategic and financially attractive M&A and then return excess capital to shareholders, largely through share repurchase. As Eric noted in his prepared remarks, year-to-date we purchased about $2.3 billion of our stock. We entered the year and indicated that we expected to purchase at least $2 billion. And I would note, we have about $1.4 billion of share repurchase authority currently approved based on our Board of Directors. And as we go forward, we'll continue to look at a whole variety of deployment opportunities consistent with those three sets of objectives, strategic M&A, two, share repurchases, item number three, our businesses are well capitalized for growth, and we continue to invest appropriately in CapEx investments for our business. So stay tuned for more as we step into 2018. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just second question. There's been some debate on whether commercial risk enrollment more broadly popped a bit this year just ex-HIX due to HIF holiday and the idea that maybe we reverse course and see a bigger pop in ASO next year with HIF coming back in. Do you agree? Are you seeing that in terms of pipeline next year? And is that what's giving some of the confidence around what seems to be maybe outsized growth, particularly within the Select segment? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Ralph, it's Eric. Maybe just a couple of comments on that front. So overall within our guaranteed cost book of business, we have had nice growth there this year. And I'd break it into a couple of categories. First of all, a meaningful portion of that's been just growth in our individual business. The remainder of it was really split between National Accounts and the Select segment. And within National Accounts, more oriented towards continued growth in our participation in different private exchanges. And then the other piece of it was within the Select segment. Within Select, by the time you split it into those buckets, think of that as less than 100,000 lives of guaranteed cost growth in the Select segment. We've had good growth and momentum in Select for a number of years now across both guaranteed costs and the ASO funding arrangements. So, again, it wouldn't point to a sea change in terms of the buying characterizations or criteria for 2017. I continue to feel like we've got good momentum, as David noted in that prior comment, as we think about Select going into 2018. So overall, good traction in both, but wouldn't point to a sea change in terms of differences in buying behavior or anything along those lines. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Giacobbe. Our next question is from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Mr. Taylor, your line is open. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to clarify something and then ask my real question. I think it's pretty clear, but worth clarification. So when you talked about the 7% to 9% organic earnings growth on top of the adjusted net income numbers, you also have a long-term stated goal of 10% to 13%, including capital deployment. So, had a couple of questions about it already. So I just want to make sure that both of those long-term targets are still in place? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Good question. Gary. It's David. Absolutely. In addition, just to amplify that, you recall from our dialogue at our Investor Day, we put forth an EPS goal for 2021 of $16. And we remain on track to achieve that goal and objective, which reinforces your question relative to our long-term average growth objective of 10% to 13% EPS, as well as, as Eric and I referenced, the 7% to 9% range on average for organic earnings growth and the residual being capital deployment. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I knew that was the answer, but I just wanted you to say the rest of it so people didn't feel like there was any change. My real question was, going to the Global Supplemental business, which has performed really well. But even within that, we're just noticing U.S. revenue up 39% year-over-year has really accelerated. Maybe could you just \u2013 obviously your second-largest market in that business. Could you maybe just touch a little bit on what products are selling so much better in the U.S. and why? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Gary, it's Eric. The primary business in that segment is Medicare Supplement business. That's the largest piece, but it's not the only piece. And we continue to have good growth in both the Medicare Supplement business as well as other individual supplemental types of benefit programs. But in terms of the biggest driver of the growth, it's Medicare Supplement. It's a business that's performed well for us. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And any obvious reason why it's done so well this year or why it's picked up? I mean, more targeted efforts selling the products or new states or any obvious comment? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Gary, this is a business that we acquired a platform a few years back now and has continued to invest into new capability. In terms of the percentage growth, it's off a pretty small base. So, as we've focused on growing this business with new charters and new product features and such, we've been able to achieve a competitive product. But the percent growth is off of that relatively small base and I continue to see opportunity in front of us there. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Taylor. Our next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Your line is open, ma'am. Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi there. You've talked repeatedly on this call about the penetration of Specialty and other solutions. Can you delve a little bit more into that? What products are you seeing really driving that Commercial growth? And going into 2018, where do you see that momentum? And was there anything in Life and Disability which improved really remarkably that was not in period or non-recurring, or is this a good run rate? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Good morning. It's David. First, importantly, when we think about, as I noted as before, the Specialty portfolio, we don't think about it simply as a cross-selling opportunity. That chapter has long since passed. We think about it as, how do you get the right dimension of integrated solutions for the benefit of employers, and ultimately their employees are our customers. You can think about as a cornerstone for us, we've been able to prove an outstanding result for the benefit of client and customers when you have at a minimum an intersection of medical, pharmacy, behavioral, that takes you to kind of life management, as well as targeted population health solutions. Operative term, targeted. So, you mine the data, you understand the health burden and the challenges of an employer or client, and you have targeted population-based health programs. Beyond that, then there's additional services. Our Dental portfolio continues to perform extraordinarily well. There's additional services above and beyond that. Lastly, as an example, while the market may not think about it as a Specialty offering, nor do we in a classic sense, we referenced One Guide, with 2 million lives on it this year, going to 4 million lives next year. It's a tremendous customer engagement, customer navigation, support set of capabilities that both individual customers benefit from, as do our clinical and service coworkers in terms of driving that on a go-forward basis. So, the key is it's a foundational body between the medical, pharmacy, behavioral and life management. And then we augment that and then bring additional services and tools beyond that. As it relates to Life and Disability, no. Not any one unique item, especially from a one-timer standpoint. We're quite pleased to see the trajectory and the momentum that we've been able to build in 2017. And we remain fully on track with our goal, which is to step into 2018 with our underlying run rate health for that business. Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question Ms. Arnold. Our next question is from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Ma'am, your line is open. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. On the employer book, you continue to show great growth on all of the segments, Select, stop loss, Middle Market, and you have almost doubled your Individual book. With the Executive Order moving to short-term policies, bare-bones, association health plans and you used to have (55:29) and much more off-Exchange presence, how do you see all of the playing out in terms of the membership growth and margins for 2018? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Ana, good morning. It's David. Relative to 2018, as we've discussed previously, big picture we see another year of attractive growth. Top-line revenue growth, customer growth and earnings growth. Specific relative to the Executive Order, it's clear that the individual market and the overall ACA components continue to evolve. We'll stay rather close to it as the Executive Order is internalized by all the respective agencies and the specific regs, rules and otherwise are promulgated throughout 2018. We've been able to position ourselves well with a diverse portfolio, as you very well made reference to products, of products, programs and services, both in Medical as well as Specialty, various funding opportunities. And I appreciate your recollection. We have a past track record relative to supplemental or alternative benefits. And all those remain vibrant. I don't believe and we don't project for that being a step function in 2018. There's too many forces moving. If it did present itself as the final EOs are converted, the EOs converted down to rules and regs, we would clarify that in a quarterly call in 2018 if we see a step function. But right now, the very attractive growth we have projected is in more of an as-is state of our current portfolio. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Thanks for that. On the Global Supplemental, if I could pivot, your margins have been really good. You've had about 150 basis points this quarter, or maybe even more. Do you see that as a sustainable margin expansion trend? And you have about 1 million policy growth in Korea and in China JV mainly. And how does it look to you for 2018? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Hi, Ana. It's Eric. In terms of the margin and such, again, as we noted in the prepared remarks, overall we continue to have really favorable experience and continue to be really pleased with the momentum we've got in this business. I would think of the margin going forward, plus or minus within the range of where we've been. So, would not be thinking about the performance as strictly a one-time item or anything along those lines. There's normal ebbs and flows in terms of things around seasonality as well as just the variability in this business. But, again, order of magnitude, feel good about the margin profile that we've delivered in this business over some time and that we've delivered this year. With respect to growth, again, not providing the detailed guidance as such here today. But we continue to have good momentum in terms of distribution and just the overall and we see that continuing. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you for your question, Ms. Gupte. Our last question is from Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open. Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for getting me in. I just wanted to go back to medical trend for a second. And I appreciate all the color that was given and the specific dynamics that helped out with the quarter. I was wondering when you think about going to 2018, and especially with your book where you mentioned they're incentiveized to help impact trend, do you see it continuing to move towards a decelerating trend, or do you think it's safe to think about it just going back to more normalized levels as we look to next year? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Zack, it's Eric. Just a couple comments on the medical trend going into next year. We're not providing the detailed guidance as we go into 2018 at this point in time, but would note that the underlying forces that have served us well in delivering this trend for a number of years fundamentally continue to work well and would expect them to continue to be in play as we look ahead to 2018. We always approach our future guidance and our future trend expectations based off of a number of factors, based on what we know about emerging technologies and changes in pharmaceuticals, et cetera, et cetera. And we'll factor that all into play when we provide our guidance for 2018. But the fundamental underlying effectiveness of our trends and such we would expect to continue as we go into next year. Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Sopcak. I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Thank you. To wrap up our call, I'd like to highlight just a few key points from today's discussion. We achieved substantial earnings growth in the third quarter, driven by continued momentum across each of our businesses. Collectively, these results combined with our exceptional capital position and ongoing free cash flow generation give us confidence that we will achieve our increased 2017 outlook and enter 2018 with considerable momentum. In a disruptive environment, Cigna's strategy of Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond, serves as our guide to value creation in each of our targeted growth platforms, including our Commercial Employer segment, our U.S. Seniors business, our Global Supplemental Benefits business and our Group Disability and Life segment. Further, our exceptional capital position today and continued strong free cash flow that our operating businesses are generating enable us to both continue to invest back in our business to drive growth and expand the solution for the benefit of our customers and clients and strategically position us for long-term growth by pursuing attractive inorganic (1:00:37) opportunities to further develop capabilities aligned to an evolving marketplace as well as effectively return excess capital to our shareholders. Finally, with respect to our initial outlook for 2018 expectations. We will continue to organically grow our businesses in terms of revenue, earnings and customers over our increased 2017 outlook, driven by four well-positioned growth platforms, a clear compelling strategy and a team of outstanding talent that's deployed around the globe. We thank you for joining our call today and look forward to our future conversations. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's third quarter 2017 results review. Cigna Investor Relations will be available to respond to additional questions shortly. A recording of this conference will be available for 10 business days following this call. You may access the recorded conference by dialing 800-945-7247 or 203-369-3951. Thank you for participating. We will now disconnect.",

At this time, all callers are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter the queue to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell. William McDowell : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's full year 2017 financial results as well as our financial outlook for 2018. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders net income, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2018 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note in today's earnings release and in our most recent Reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, I note that in the fourth quarter, we recorded special item charges to shareholders net income totaling $221 million, or $0.88 per share, primarily to reflect the impact of the recently passed U.S. tax reform legislation. Specifically, this fourth quarter charge was related to the revaluation of the company\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new statutory rate and a one-time tax on overseas earnings. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of financial results. Lastly, and as previously disclosed effective January 1, 2018 Cigna will adopt a new accounting standard titled revenue from contracts with customers or ASU 2014-09 which addresses recognition of revenues under GAAP. Cigna will adopt this accounting change on a retrospective basis in the first quarter of 2018 and will recast prior periods. This accounting change requires reclassifications that impact certain financial ratios, but importantly have no impact on the fundamentals of the business and no impact to earnings or cash flows. Because this accounting change is effective January 1, 2018 the impact of the new standard is not reflected in our 2017 results that David and Eric will discuss in a few moments. However, when David and Eric will provide commentary on our 2018 outlook, it will be on a basis that assumes retrospective adoption of this accounting change with both 2018 and 2017 discussed on the basis of the new standard. To assist analysts in modeling the impact of this accounting change, we have included a supplemental schedule of financial information on page 17 of our quarterly financial settlement which shows the impact to our financial statements and ratios for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Finally, consistent with past practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior year development of medical costs. And with that, I will turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks Will. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today. I\u2019ll begin my comments by reviewing the highlights of our 2017 financial results, which reflect exceptionally strong performance across our portfolio of businesses. Our sustained, differentiated results were driven by the effective execution of our go-strategy, along with the ongoing contributions of our talented and focused team to always put our customers at the center of all we do. I will also highlight how we are continuing to deliver differentiated value and growth in our U.S. commercial employer market where we see effectively consultatively [ph] engage in customized solutions that improve our clients business and the quality of life for our customers. I\u2019ll then offer initial insight into our expectations for 2018 which includes sustained momentum across our businesses and a strong capital position, driven by the organic results we deliver as well as enhanced impact from recently passed tax legislation. Eric will then address our fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results in more detail and will provide the specifics for our outlook for 2018 before we take your questions and then I\u2019ll call a Q&A with some wrap up comments. Let\u2019s dive in with some highlights from our share. Our results include strong performance across each of our priority growth platforms. Commercial employer, U.S. seniors, Global Supplemental Benefits and Group Disability & Life led by delivery of continued industry-leading medical cost trend. For 2017, our full year consolidated revenue increased by 5% to $41.6 billion. We reported full year adjusted income from operations of $2.7 billion or $10.46 per share representing a per-share increase of 29% with each of our business segments delivering strong growth over 2016. In addition, in 2017 Cigna grew to serve more than 95 million customer relationships worldwide all while continuing to generate strong margins and significant free cash flow for the benefit of our shareholders. Overall, we delivered very strong result in 2017 and as I\u2019ll discuss in more detail we are positioned to once again deliver competitively attractive revenue and earnings growth in 2018. Now I\u2019ll spend the next few minutes delving further into our U.S. commercial employer business. We continue to view the employer marketplace as a very attractive growth opportunity. In a highly dynamic and disruptive environment, we continue to create value for employers by pursuing the right balance of affordability and personalization through a greater emphasis on alignment, transparency, and being the undisputed partner of choice. We improve our client\u2019s business by helping to ensure they have healthy, present and engaged employees all on a more affordable and predictable basis. We achieved this in three key ways; first, through a strategic orientation and focus on alignment and engagement, which helps our employer clients better manage costs, and leverage integration to improve health and productivity all in a personalized fashion. This approach enables us to drive growth across our U.S. portfolio of businesses including significant opportunities to continue to add new clients in the Select and Middle Market segments and on a targeted basis with international account segment. Second, we continue to retain, develop and attract the best talent around the world, which enables us to operate with a high touch consultative service orientation for the benefits of our customers and clients. As we simplify many of the complexities in healthcare ecosystem, such as making it easier for our customers to connect to the right doctors, coaches and clinicians and take the customize employee benefit programs. And third, our ongoing investments with our commercial employer business to further enhance affordability and personalization is in large part driven by effective, ongoing integration. Growth of the integration Cigna\u2019s approach differs considerably from traditional cross selling which simply combines multiple products into one sale and it differs from bundling, which improves only the pricing structure of a sale. Rather Cigna\u2019s integrated model goes beyond, meaning we use combined data across our solutions to develop insights that drive improved health outcomes. For example, our behavioural and medical teams work closely to identify Cigna customers with conditions which frequently lead to co morbidities in the behavioural realm, such as depression, positioning all behavioural colleagues to intervene on a preventative basis. In addition, we continue to embed lifestyle coaching into our medical programs. This approach helps our customers achieve their specific health goals such as smoking cessation, achieving a healthier weight for better and more effectively managing their chronic conditions. Pharmacy integration is another key driver for us to help improve overall health and affordability. Our integrated approach provides us with additional customer touch points to help ensure individuals who are taking their medication and to drive increase health engagement in specialty condition management, case management and health coaching. In addition our specialty pharmacy capability drives significant opportunities to improve affordability for the most complex cases, because our integrated model manages both the pharmacy and medical side of the cost. I would [Indiscernible] approach here help this drive the lowest medical cost trend in the industry again in 2017. Going forward, we will continue to define industry-leading integration by bringing innovative and new approaches to the market. For example, our initiative to reduce the use of opioids has pharmacy, behavioural as well as medical components, including close collaboration with our network partners to improve prescribing patterns. Our approach to integration in addition to helping to drive clinical outcomes and affordability also helps to further improve the overall customer experience. An additional example of our ongoing investments in innovation is our recent acquisition of Brighter, one of healthcare\u2019s most innovative technology companies. Brighter engages customers and healthcare providers to more effectively and efficiently deliver high-value healthcare in a personalized and seamless way. This acquisition further accelerates our ability to develop new digital platforms as well as to further innovate new end-to-end experiences that connect individuals and healthcare providers with the guidance, support and incentive they need to further improve affordability and personalization. Taken together, our broad and diverse capabilities integrated solutions and customer centric approach have consistently fueled our ability to deliver best-in-class medical cost trend for many years running. To illustrate the importance of the impact of medical trend, I\u2019ll provide a specific employer example. A 1000 life employer working with Cigna would have experienced nearly $2 million in medical cost savings over the last five years, relative to the industry average medical cost trend of 67%, thereby providing opportunities for them to strengthen their business in this highly competitive environment, whether through further investments in innovation, expansion of the workforce or margin growth, and with approximately 85% of our U.S. commercial customers being serviced through transparent ASO funding arrangements, Cigna\u2019s medical cost trend results directly benefit our employer clients, their employees and families. Now looking ahead to overall expectation for 2018, we will continue creating strong value for our customers, clients and as a result for our shareholders through our consistent focus on delivering affordability personalization as well as partnering with healthcare professionals to ensure our customers receive the highest quality healthcare. We expect to deliver revenue growth in line with our long-term objective of high single digit annual growth. Our outlook anticipates a 19% to 23% EPS growth rate over 2017 and I would note consistent to our practices, our EPS outlook does not include the impact of prior year reserve development or any future capital deployment in 2018. Regarding recent U.S. tax reform, we anticipate positive earnings impact in 2018 inclusive of further investments in three critical areas, furthering our capabilities relative to innovation for the benefit of our customers, client and healthcare professional partners, furthering investments in market-based initiatives benefiting our external stakeholders including our communities and further investments in our Cigna colleagues. Overall for 2018, we expect continued strong financial health and free cash flow inclusive of these investments. Now stepping back, at our investor day in June of 2017, we introduced an attractive EPS target of $16 per share for 2021. Each of our four growth platforms have remained well positioned for sustained growth. We have momentum from our 2017 performance expect to deliver another strong result in 2018 augmented by the U.S. tax reform. In addition to this strong positioning we are further aided by our tremendous ongoing capital position. As a result, today, we are pleased to increase our long-term EPS target from $16 per share to $18 per share for 2021. As I turn the call over to Eric, I want to recognize what our talented team of approximately 45,000 colleagues around the globe are positioned to achieve in 2018. As a team, we are poised to continue driving attractive growth and significant value creation for our customers, clients as well as our shareholders. As a team, we remain driven by our unwavering mission of helping to improve the health, well-being in sense of security of those we serve around the world, and our innovative approach to meeting the needs of our customers and clients furthers our ability to deliver top and bottom line growth and gives us confidence we will achieve our very attractive full year 2018 outlook as well as our long-term objectives. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Eric. Eric Palmer : Thanks, David and good morning everyone. In my remarks today, I will review Cigna\u2019s 2017 results and provide our outlook for 2018. Key financial highlights for 2017 include consolidated revenue growth of 5% to $41.6 billion, consolidated earnings growth of 27% to $2.7 billion, earnings per share growth of 29% to $10.46 and continued strong free cash flow and $2.8 billion return to shareholders through share repurchase in 2017. These results reflect the underlying strength of our franchise and provide us with considerable momentum for continued growth in 2018. Regarding our segments, I will first comment on Global healthcare. 2017 premiums and fees grew 5% to $29 billion driven by strong customer growth and specialty contributions across all commercial market segments and as expected, this growth was partially offset by lower seniors enrolment. We ended 2017 with 15.9 million Global Medical customers, an organic increase of 710,000 lives which represents 5% growth over 2016. Full year earnings were $2.17 billion, reflecting growth in medical customers and specialty relationships, continued effective medical cost management and operating expense discipline. Turning to medical costs, we continued to deliver medical cost that reflect better health outcomes as a result of our deep engagement and collaboration with customers, clients and physicians. Our focus on personalization of care and the power of our differentiated speciality integration model. For our total U.S. Commercial book of business, full year medical cost trend for 2017 was better than the low-end of our previous guidance range of 3% to 4%. As David discussed, our commercial medical trend result once again reflects industry-leading performance and enabled our employer clients to make further investment in innovation, expand their workforce and grow their margins. The total commercial medical care ratio or MCR of 79.9% for full year 2017 reflects the continued effectiveness of our medical cost management capabilities as well as the impact of the health insurance tax suspension. This MCR also reflects better-than-expected medical costs in our U.S. individual business, which generated a small profit in 2017. The total government medical care ratio of 84.9% for full year 2017 reflects the impact of our innovative physician engagement model within Medicare advantage and is consistent with our expectations. Full year 2017 Global Healthcare earnings also included favorable net prior year reserve development of $112 million after-tax. The Global Healthcare operating expense ratio of 20.9% for full year 2017 reflects the impact of the health insurance tax suspension, business mix exchanges and continued effective expense management. Overall, we\u2019ve had another strong year in Global Healthcare. Turning to our global supplemental benefits business. Our full year 2017 results reflect continued attractive growth and profitability as premium and fees grew to $3.7 billion an increase of 14% and full-year 2017 earnings grew 26% to $369 million, reflecting business growth, favourable point of experience and continued operating expense discipline. For Group Disability and Life, full year 2017 premiums and fees were $4.1 billion. Full year earnings in our Group business increased to $285 million, reflecting strong performance in both our Disability and Life businesses. Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, Cigna delivered strong revenue and earnings contribution from our Global healthcare, Global Supplemental Benefits and Group Disability & Life businesses in 2017. We also continued to generate strong free cash flow across our enterprise and maintain significant financial flexibility. Now I will discuss our outlook for 2018. As we continued to drive strong value for our customers and clients, we step into 2018 with momentum in each of our businesses. As a result, in 2017 we expect to deliver attractive financial growth by deepening our customer and client relationships, delivering on-going superior medical quality and cost outcomes and continuing to invest in innovative solutions to more effectively engage with our customers and healthcare professionals. For full-year 2018, we expect consolidated revenues to grow in the range of 7% to 8% over 2017 with continued growth across our targeted market segments. We expect full year 2018 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be 3.08 billion to 3.2 billion or $12.40 to $12.90 per share. This represents growth in the range of 19% to 23%. This outlook includes approximately $425 million of incremental after-tax earnings resulting from U.S. corporate tax reform. I would note that this incremental earnings estimate is net of $150 million after-tax and additional investment in our employees, communities and partners as well as our capabilities that enable us to better serve our customers and clients while accelerating long-term growth. For 2018, we project the consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 24% to 25%. Consistent with prior practice, our outlook excludes any contribution from future capital deployment as well as prior year claim [ph] development. Now putting our 2018 outlook and our 2017 actual result on a comparable basis, that is adjusting for the reserve development reported in our 2017 results, and excluding the impacts from tax reform, our outlook for earnings in 2018 reflects 4% to 9% growth over 2017, and our outlook for EPS growth is 7% to 12% before considering the impact of additional capital deployment. I will now discuss the components of our 2018 outlook starting with Global Healthcare. We expect full-year Global Healthcare earnings in the range of approximately $2.6 million to $2.68 million. This outlook reflects strength in our commercial employer business, driven by continued benefits from organic customer growth, specialty contributions and effective medical cost management as well as continued solid performance in our Medicare advantage business. Key assumptions reflected in our Global Healthcare earnings outlook for 2008 include the following; regarding total medical customers, we expect 2018 growth in the range of 300,000 to 500,000 customers, driven by continued strong customer and client retention and new growth in our commercial business. And approximately, 3% growth in Medicare advantage customers. Turning to medical costs. For our total U.S. Commercial Employer book of business, we now expect full-year 2018 medical cost trends to be in the range of 4% to 5%, with the increase over 2017 full year trend due to expected increases in utilization and pharmacy costs. For our total commercial book of business, we expect the 2018 medical care ratio to be in the range of 77.5% to 78.5% reflecting the impact from the health insurance tax in 2018. For our total Government book of business, we expect the 2018 Medical Care Ratio to be in the range of 84% to 85%. Regarding operating expenses, we expect our 2018 global healthcare operating expense ratio to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5% reflecting the impact from the health insurance tax in 2018. Now moving to our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we expect full year 2018 earnings in the range of $380 million to $400 million, reflecting business growth and continued strong operational performance. And regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we expect full year 2018 earnings in the range of $330 million to $350 million driven by ongoing performance momentum in both our Disability and Life businesses. Lastly, regarding our remaining operations that is other operations and corporate, we expect the loss of $230 million for 2018. To all-in for full year 2008, we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $3.08 billion to $3.2 billion, or $12.40 to $12.90 per share. I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of prior year reserve development or any future capital deployment. Overall these expected results represent a competitively attractive outlook and underscore the strong performance of our diverse and differentiated portfolio of businesses. Now moving to our 2018 capital management position and outlook, overall, we continue to have excellent financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent with the strong return on capital in each of our business segments, while we maintain significant free cash and leverage capacity available at the parent company. Our capital deployment strategy and priorities remain, first, funding our businesses to support long-term growth, next, pursuing strategic M&A and lastly, after considering these first two items we would return capital to shareholders primarily through share repurchase. Regarding free cash flow, during 2017 we repurchased 15.7 million shares of common stock for $2.8 billion, and we ended the year with parent company cash of $1.2 billion including $250 million held for liquidity purposes. Considering sources and uses the parent company cash, we expect to have approximately $2.8 million available for capital deployment in 2018 including approximately $260 million we deployed to repurchase 1.2 million shares in January 2018. Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from industry leading margins and returns on capital in our businesses and the high level of capital efficiency, particularly from our fee-based businesses. Now to recap. Our full-year 2017 consolidated results reflect the strength for our diversified portfolio of Global businesses and continued track record of effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and we are confident in our ability to achieve our full-year 2018 earnings outlook. With that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe just a broad question, but earlier this week this sector got little bit rolled by announcement of the three large employers that they will going to try something innovative instead of a joint venture. I wonder if you have opened any question, but one of you would comment on -- are you seeing that kind of activity among other large employers? What kind of opportunities and challenges might that present for Cigna? And I think there were specific discussions in the investment community about whether that had any implications for ASO business which I know is important for you and give you a chance to offer your thoughts on that as well maybe? David Cordani : Good morning. It\u2019s David. Clearly the announcement was not lost on us. So stepping back I think one way we look at the announcement is, it reinforces something we\u2019ve been talking about for quite some time, which is \u2013 it\u2019s a pretty dynamic industry and the older orientation around focusing only on insurance or a fee-for-service healthcare delivery model is just fundamentally not sustainable as employers and customers demand more. Secondly, from our point of view, it reinforces the imperative of focusing on transparency, focusing on alignment and focusing on in a demonstrable way helping to ensure that you have the ability to drive healthy productive present employees and making employer's business better and more effective. I would point to as an example something we\u2019re quite proud of not only the lowest medical cost trend in the industry year-in and year-out, but this year for 2017 we ended favorable to the lower end of our improved range, so less than 3% medical cost trend for the benefit of our clients and customers. Looking forward, we actually see initiatives like this is actually presenting more opportunities than not. To your question there are been other different forms of coalitions forming, although this is a different coalition. Coalitions forming through the national business group on health, coalitions forming, you can look at it through private exchanges. And overtime each of them had presented opportunities interestingly for additional growth for us for both our medical and specialty offerings because we\u2019re oriented around transparent aligned funding relationships. So, taken as whole we view it as indicative of a changing dynamic environment, indicative of employers seeing this more as a strategic investment in the capital and employers seeking opportunities to get more leverage, more impact for the benefit of running the business and we can more opportunity than not. A.J. Rice: Okay. That's great. And maybe just a quick follow-up on another topic, Eric, I think you mentioned that the guidance now assumes 3% MA growth this year. I know you're in that sort of rebuilding back to growth. I guess that my question would generally be would -- to get back to like market type of growth what needs to happen over the next six to 12 months and are you optimistic that as you look at 2019 and beyond that you could be get back to a market-based growth in MA? Eric Palmer : A.J. its Eric. Yes, 3% growth is the number we expected for the year. I think in terms of getting back to our long-term targets which would be high single digits growth rate in terms of the revenue and associated lives in the Medicare Advantage really reflects our momentum and such no obstacle whatsoever from my perspective in terms of achieving that over the longer term. As we entered this year we had the effect of some exits of counties. We didn't open up any new counties or any new markets this year, but as we cleared to that January cycle and look ahead to the future, don\u2019t see any reason why we couldn't get back to our and won\u2019t get back to our long-term averages. A.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rice. Our next question is from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open sir. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just a quick clarification, you talked about the 150 million sort of an offset on tax benefit. I just want to clear that up. Does that include some minimum MLRs and rebates and things like that? I know you guys have as much risk business, but does that included in the 150 and if so how much? And then my real question is just more on the retail presence and you know, your views on the necessity there maybe remind us have a HealthSpring clinics are working, how many of those you have, and sort of what the plans are? But I\u2019m just curious what your perspectives are in terms of sort of that retail market for healthcare? Eric Palmer : Josh, it\u2019s Eric. I\u2019ll start with the first part of your question, just be clear, yes, any impact from the minimum MRL, rebates and such are included in the $150 million. The amount is small in terms of a portion to that given the profile of our book of business and such, but that is included in the 150. I\u2019ll ask David to comment on the other item. David Cordani : Josh, good morning. Two comments specific in general. Specific to your question, think about as today as we operate before we get the HealthSpring. We\u2019re able to operate and deliver quite good services for employer clients through on-site clinic management and coordination, on-site health coaches, management and coordination, in select instances, on-site pharmacy management coordination, so think about that is one retail point of interaction that we do on a highly integrated basis. Secondly to your HealthSpring question, HealthSpring model, as you recall, there are different footprints and different geographies, we can go as broad as the Cigna owned medical group in Arizona to owning bricks and mortar real estate in Tennessee and having independent physicians rotate through that and everywhere in between. I think more broadly stepping back as it relates to retail footprint, our strategic view is that virtual vertical integration is a preferred approach versus wholesale vertical integration on a hardened basis. So what we mean by that is we are through virtual vertical integration, we\u2019re able to drive improved alignment, choice and transparency where we aggressively embrace technology to expand access and choice and where we partner to create a more open framework to expand choice and impact through affordability and personalization. So, again, we have a variety of footprints, but we really prefer and are driving aggressively the vertical integration through a virtual mechanism to get that alignment, the impact, the choice and embrace technology. Josh Raskin : Okay. Perfect. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Sir, your line is open. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning. First, just want to ask about the $18 in EPS in 2021, obviously some of that tax reform, but just looking on a CAGR basis it suggested about 12.5% growth. And if I look at the $16 number was closer to 11%. So, just wanted to sort of bridge that in terms way you expects sort of faster underlying growth beyond tax reform from where we were not that long ago on you threw out the $16 number? Thanks. David Cordani : Yes, Ralph, when we discuss the $16 number at our Investor Day, obviously we walked through a pretty methodical framing of that. So, stepping back we\u2019re quite pleased to be able to put that forth the framing of the four growth platforms and the very attractive growth profile of each of those platforms led by strong retention, further relationship expansion and net new business adds. To your question, what\u2019s net new? I\u2019d ask you to think about two things, right. The underlying strength of our platform, we ended 2017 ahead of our strategic glide path period. We delivered an EPS growth rate of 29%. We\u2019re able to step into 2018 with an outlook as Eric articulated to grow our EPS by 19% to 23% before reserve development or any additional capital deployment. So point one is the organic fundamentals ended the year stronger which gives us more leverage power stepping into 2018. Second, is the impact of tax reform and our belief in terms of the combination of both of those enable us to increase the outlook from a very attractive $16 to even more attractive $18. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just the follow-up, has there been any push back on ASO fees from existing customer just on the fee itself. And then as you look across your book it sort of the average trend that you mention sort of below the 3% level. Do you see differences in trends between large nationals that may not be willing to adopt some your medical management approaches versus the smaller select and mid markets that maybe more willing to adopt your approach? Thanks. David Cordani : Ralph, first relative to ASO fees, as you may recall from prior conversation we typically don't look at an employer relationship as a fee-only relationship. Our entire approach with our employer clients at all levels. So from select through middle market, through national is to look at the portfolio of services that best suit their strategy, their change agenda and have the highest opportunity for impact vis-\u00e0-vis some of the integrated offerings I made comment on -- before my prepared remarks. And then get an economic relationship with them that work in a quite transparent basis. So we\u2019ve long since moved from micromanagement of the fee environment and candidly I would view the fee environment as a smaller part of the overall conversation. To your broader question relative to medical cost trend and the like. The positive [Indiscernible] it transcend the portfolio, right, as you recall ASO aided by further shared returns encompasses over 90% of all of our relationships. So that positive medical trend performance is indicative of the entire portfolio and the performance of the portfolio and what tends to drive it to such a powerful level is the alignment with the employer and transparency, highly innovative clinical programs and engagement incentive-based programs and then increasing leverage of the collaborative accountable care relationships that we\u2019re able to deliver for the benefit of our clients. Eric Palmer : Ralph, it\u2019s Eric, one other point on what David said there and as David noted in his prepared remarks this morning, the effectiveness of the integration of the specialty model helps to drive even more effectiveness in terms of trends. So as we have highly integrated offerings in the smaller end of the market I generally see even the better results than the bottles that are little more a la carte or fragmented. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Zach Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Zach, your line is open. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question will come from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Mr. Borsch, your line is open. Matt Borsch : Yes. Thank you. You know, I was hoping you just maybe extend a little bit on the reaction to the joint venture of the three companies. And maybe just I get the consideration of the employer coalitions and the ones that we've seen before. I think maybe what also rattled investors though is couple of things; the tone of dissatisfaction and frustration with the medical cost outcomes, somehow being just opposed with poor profit orientation in healthcare, as well as the prospect of this gigantic tax behemoth that's disrupted other industries maybe they're just coming in to do this coalition, but perhaps its more than that. Can you just address that? I know it\u2019s wide open, but whatever you can say. David Cordani : Matt, it\u2019s David. First nice job trying to displace Zach from the call queue; and Zach will get back to you as quickly as we can. Matt, I think just part of your question and I appreciate the way you framed it. I mean, at the end of the day we have talked for quite some time, while the industry as a whole for example may step back and we have a narrative around more stabilized or more muted medical cost trend. We as a company been very consistent, it is still unsustainable. So as I illustrated in the prepared remarks for example, a 1000 life employer experiencing illustratively our medical cost trend versus the industry average is a multimillion dollar savings and we believe we need to do even better. So, when you look at the size and impact of medical cost trend growth being an industry average of six or seven or our industry-leading trend of below 3% this year, employers will rightfully continue to push for more value from their sizable investment and increasingly they see this disinvestment as a strategic investment and we\u2019ll manage it as a strategic investment to help them run their business more effectively. Over time we think that creates more opportunity versus less for us, because we seek to be at an integrated partner for the services standpoint providing the services that deliver the value. As you know our industry is capital-intensive, as well as relatively low margin, single-digit margin, so this is not going to get solved with extracting a couple points of margin out of the equation. The solution here is helping to keep people healthier in the first place, to avoid health risk, health consumption, lowering the health risk for the 25% of Americans that are medium and high risk will be chronic or acute in two years of those risk don\u2019t go mitigated and getting the best possible evidence-based care compliance for those dealing with chronic condition and then optimizing care delivery for those confronting acute conditions. That's how the sustainability of the system is driven and employers flexing their muscle and becoming more vocal in terms of driving and being more demanding around that we actually view as a net positive, because we think the employer market is a positive aggregation of individuals and a way to get strategic alignment. So to recap, we should not view that an industry with stable medical cost trend at 5%, 6%, 7% is sustainable. We\u2019re proud of the fact that we delivered half of that. We need to do better and you do better by engagement, alignment and driving health improvement and getting the best possible quality of care when care is consumed. Matt Borsch : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Our next question will come from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. Just handful of number of questions here from me. First on the 2021 numbers change, sounds like to the great extent this is the improvement in taxes and some improved business momentum. On the tax side you're looking out for years and obviously assuming that a lot of this is sustainable. Can you walk us through kind of your thought process on sustainability of higher effective net income margins as you go through kind of competitive iteration over a few years? David Cordani : Justin, its David. Good morning. I guess couple of thoughts. First to reinforce, the $16 starting point was based on strong fundamental sustained organic growth for franchise and then effective capital deployment. Yielding is as you would recall, a very attractive result. The step up these two items, I don't want to walk away from the stronger results we deliver in 2017, put us ahead of us to glide path and give us leverage going forward. Specific to the taxes, as you know in the U.S. we\u2019re predominately a service-based business that has higher transparency versus not, as Eric articulated earlier there\u2019s relatively de minimis impact of the taxes on my minimum MLRs and the like, so we have more flexibility or choice with which to deploy it. For 2018 we made a very disciplined assessment of how to invest if you will those assets for sustained growth on a go forward basis looking at our customers, our clients, our community, our coworkers and our shareholders. And we\u2019re quite confident that it\u2019s a long way -- as we have continued innovation and effective execution we\u2019ll be able to both deliver the value for clients and customers as well as realize a fair return for shareholders. So we see a lot of opportunities as we look for between 2018, 2019 and 2021. Justin Lake : Great. And then, on the two things; one, Disability and Life, 7.5%, 8% margins is where you were before the issues kind of occur there. By my estimate it doesn\u2019t look like you got back to your 7.5% to 8% margin that you used to do there with the guidance. Is there some reason for that? And is the true? And then on membership growth can you just give us some color on where the segments beyond Medicare Advantage ASO versus commercial risk versus experience rated, where you expect that membership to come? Thanks a lot. Eric Palmer : Justin, it\u2019s Eric. As it relates to the Disability and Life, we think the guidance we\u2019ve provided is attractive and align with our long-term strategic targets. So again we think that business is performing in line with the strategic targets that we set for it over the long-term. As it relates to membership growth we would note a couple of things that's tying up comments David made in his prepared remarks, first of all, continued really strong momentum in the select segment in the middle market segments in particular we would see a growth there and across the insured versus ASO split again, we\u2019d expect growth across each one of the funding arrangements as we go into 2018. Justin Lake : All right. Thanks Operator : Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question is from Zach Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open sir. Zach Sopcak : Thank you. And sorry about difficulty earlier. I just wanted to circle back on the comment Eric made on cost trend for 2018. And he mentioned potentially increased utilization. Is there anything that you\u2019re seeing in January that makes you think that utilization going to up a bunch? Or is it just coming off of a low in 2017? Eric Palmer : Zach, it\u2019s Eric. Nothing specific I would call out in terms of things that we\u2019re seeing that would \u2013 I would point to you. I think its more just coming off of the low trend that we delivered in the course of the of 2017. In particular we had very favorable pharmacy trend in the course 2017. We finished 2017 with pharmacy trend that essentially zero. We wouldn\u2019t expect that to be the rate going forward, but again, we pull those pieces together overall and nothing I would point to in terms of specifically higher utilization. Zach Sopcak : Okay. That was it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Sopcak. Our next is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is open. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. If you go back to one of deal with Anthem growth, how you outlined about 7 billion of kind of capital available for deployment [Indiscernible] if you wanted to do M&A. Where do we stand in those numbers now? And then, I guess you mentioned that there was foreign tax, one-time tax in a quarter. So that mean, we repatriate in cash in 2018? Eric Palmer : It\u2019s Eric. Couple of parts to that question there. First of all, as it relates to the seven to 14 items, so we issued the $7 billion to $14 billion range at the time of the Anthem break just to help provide some framing. At that time the $7 billion end of the range represented capital available for deployment that we had on the balance sheet, plus the impact of the break fee, plus the additional leverage capacity that we had to return to more normal range. The upper end of that range represented what we could do if we took additional leverage and pursued a strategic M&A transaction. Now, as I noted in my prepared remarks, we expect to have your $2.8 billion or so available in 2018 plus still significant balance sheet capacity. So, again, the overall framework that we described in terms of the $7 billion to $14 billion continues to apply, will continue to be disciplined in terms of our approach on deployment and such overall. On the second part of your question, could you just repeat the specifics, I want to make sure I'm answering it appropriately. Kevin Fischbeck : I think I thought somewhere in your prepared remarks you indicated that you were -- it was like a one-time tax on foreign earnings as part of tax reform. And I wasn't sure if that meant that you were repatriating cash in 2018 or are you saying cash in 2018 is the question. And if so how much of that is that $2.8 billion. Eric Palmer : Yes, the specific item there that we talked about in the terms of the tax associated with the foreign earnings is the repatriation portion of the recently reformed tax law. We are not anticipating significant repatriation and the tax law hasn't really changed our plans in terms of how we bring dollars back. We generally have used overseas capital to support the growth outside the United States and we continue to do so. Kevin Fischbeck : All right. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question is from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Ma'am, your line is open. Christine Arnold : Hi there. Thanks. Two questions. First you're less than 2% trend, can you remind us does that include or exclude buy downs? And if it includes buy downs, could a reduction in the corporate tax rate cause, kind of a pause in that? How are you thinking about that? And then second you've talked a lot about Medicare Advantage and I understand 2018 is a repositioning year, how do you think about Medicare Advantage long-term? Do you feel like you can get to the footprint and the growth rate you need organically? Or do you feel you know that maybe something more strategic from an M&A perspective might be required in that area? Thanks. Eric Palmer : Christine its Eric, I'll start with the trend item and then ask David to comment on the Medicare Advantage pieces. So, the trend, the trend statistics we talk about on this call represent our U.S. commercial employer paid claim trends across all of our book of business. And, again, just as a reminder given that over 85% of our customer lives are self-funded, this statistic represents the amount that our clients are spending per customer per month year-over-year. There's no other adjustment or anything in terms of how we calculate that trend. Now, the difference between that paid trend or what you might call in a loud trend, the loud trend will help to include the effective cost borne by the individual customer in terms of deductibles and copays etcetera. Given that we tend to have high customer retention from period-to-period our clients generally have pretty stable benefits from period-to-period that we haven't seen much difference between paid or allowed trends. But if you look at that allowed basis that includes the effect of car-sharing and such for 2017, our trend actually would have been even a little bit lower yet than the paid trends that I talked about in my prepared remarks. David, if you want to tackle the Medicare Advantage question. David Cordani : Hey, Christine relative to Medicare Advantage in Medicare Growth, we continue to see it is an attractive opportunity to immediate long-term for us. I would ask you to think about it in a couple of ways. First relative to further accelerating organic growth, as Eric indicated, we view 2018 as a transition year. As we step into 2019 and beyond, we believe significant opportunity to open new markets and adjacent counties. We are aided by the fact that we have a deep collaborative accountable care relationships in multiple states in multiple markets that are highly attractive for us for growth. Those relationships are focused on commercial today and many of those collaborative partners are excited to open up new Medicare Advantage relationships with us. So, we see the organic new market entry opportunities for 2019 and beyond is very attractive and in addition as you'll recall, we continue to have Medicare and seniors footprint growth as one of our M&A priority. So, it's one of our five M&A priorities. So, we see both opportunities through both organic expansion as well as inorganic expansion to generate sustained growth there. Christine Arnold : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Arnold. Our next question is from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open sir. Steve Tanal : Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to circle up on tax reform, may close the loop on this. The $150 million of reinvestment sounds like an after-tax figure, and just using the tax rate, I guess, the pretax amount is maybe closer to $200 million. I just wanted to confirm that the way tax announced yesterday are sort of $45 million of that amount? And maybe get some color on specifics of where the rest will be reinvested. And then just finally, tying up some comments earlier around sustainability of medical cost trend generally, when do you see deflation if the \u2013 we continue down this path? David Cordani : Steve, good morning, it's David. I'll address the taxes, and I'll ask Eric to talk about the medical cost trend and your interesting twist on it with deflation. Specifically, relative to investments, you've framed it correctly, we're talking about after-tax numbers, what are the implication, etcetera, but we're talking about a meaningful investment back into multiple key constituency group. So, you articulated rightfully, significant amount of investments back into our coworkers. And the next part that I'd ask you to think about is, furthering investments back in the company relative to innovation and innovative capabilities. We have had a long sustainable track record of designing and bringing new solutions and capabilities to market. We're going to take this opportunity to even further accelerate that in 2018, so a meaningful portion of the $150 million will make its way there. And then third category we referenced is, returning it back to the marketplace beyond that, so opportunities relative to furthering our community initiatives through our foundation and the like. Taken as a whole, that equates to approximately the 25% in aggregate of the impact that we talked about, making up the $150 million. Eric, if you share your thoughts relative to medical trend? Eric Palmer : Yes, Steve, on the medical trend. I think a couple of points that I want to make sure land here. First of all, our trend results reflect the power of the incentive line and the power of our integrated model. And again, we're really proud of the result that we generated there. But as David said before, there is more work to be done. Not to -- to be able to predict the day or time that we hit the -- a point of deflation but there's more work to be done and we think there's quite a bit more we could tackle with the integrated model that we bring to the market. Steve Tanal : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Mr. Tanal. Our next question is from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Gary Taylor : Hi. Good morning. Just wanted a little more detail on some of the segment guidance that you provided. Is it possible just to walk through by segment, what tax rates would look like by segment for 2018 embedded in your guidance? Eric Palmer : Gary it's Eric. That plan into numbered the exact kind of tax rates by segment, but what I encourage you to think about the things in the following way. So, within the Global Health Care and Group Life and Disability business, the largest share of those businesses are here in the U.S. and that's where the bulk of our businesses, so you would expect to see the biggest impact there. And those businesses the impacted by U.S. tax reform. The Global Supplemental Benefits business has a net tax headwind year-on-year that some of our non-U.S. jurisdictions have actually increased income tax rates so just a slight increase in terms of Global Supplemental Benefits business. And then within corporate and other operations, there's a tax rate favorability, but earnings headwind reflecting that segment where operating had a loss in total. So, those would be that piece that I would point you too. Gary Taylor : And as a quick follow-up. So, when we look at the corporate cost increasing 45% or so year-over-year, there's a tax that's -- I guess, that primary delta you're seeing is the tax treatment within that segment. Is that correct? Eric Palmer : Gary, year-on-year, there's two things that point there both tax-related. First of all is the effect of the lower tax rate in 2018 and the second is the absence of some tax favorability that we had in 2017. So, some tax-related items, so it's separate from the income tax rate that we talked about earlier in the year in 2017. We don't expect those to return next year. Gary Taylor : So, the 230, that's a good go-forward on corporate expense though? Eric Palmer : Yes. Gary Taylor : Out years. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Taylor. Our next question is from Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Your line is open, ma'am. Ana Gupte : Yes, hi, thanks for the question. So, coming back to the basis of the diamond coalition. I guess, at the end of the day, is it because insurance companies are not communicating the value that they are delivering well enough for? And you should -- the company be thinking of it from the point of view of the American consumer and make it simple? They see lack of transparency on the pharmacy side of the house? And was there anything significant that can be done by Amazon on that? Secondly, on the buy downs and increase in deductibles. Consumer's think of the insurance at this point is just becoming catastrophic coverage at best. And then finally, on kind of breaking it down between pricing and utilization, do you see the opportunity for the private managed care and to see the improved things on pricing? Or might be even get worse as we are seeing even more consolidation among the large not for profit hospitals at this point? David Cordani : Ana, it\u2019s David. So, multiple different questions, and let me try to address a couple of themes and invite Eric to add to it. I'm not sure we're going to be able to address every complexity referencing your question. In the first question, I think about it in a couple of ways, right? As indicated before, this is an example of three large impactful voices, essentially suggesting that there's an opportunity to do more and they're going to lean in aggressively to enable more to be done whether it's through technological leverage, whether it's through insight and data, whether it's through insight and data, whether it's through a variety of items. But each one of those entities, essentially are ASO-serviced. So, if they're ASO-serviced, they're bearing their own risk and they're going to elevate the demands both for the parties they do business with as well as for their coworkers who are engaging in the overall equation. To your inference, I think there's opportunity and transparency, there's further opportunity in alignment, there's further opportunity in simplifying the complex. That's all on strategy from our point of view and we believe we have an opportunity to add value in every one of those areas. But it also means that the consumer and the employer need to more aggressively embrace change along the way. Net-net, we see of all of it as a positive. On your last point, I don't know. I don't know relative to the inference, relative to the consolidation and not for profits cost implications, et cetera. I would put into face of that two forces that are indisputable right now. One, you made reference to yourself, which is a relentless increase drive for transparency and demonstrable value delivery. And second, reword alignment relative to value-based care. I think those forces are indisputable and will confront any level of change and configuration of the supply chain or otherwise to push for more demonstrable value delivery and then elevation and transparency across care and quality. Eric, anything to add? Eric Palmer : Ana, it's Eric. Just one other thing I would add relative to your comment about buy downs and such. I think one of the things I've noted -- and I've actually noted in the -- my response to Christine's question about paid versus allowed trend is actually, our allowed trend would have been a little bit lower that's because in 2017 versus 2016, our employers paid a little bit higher percentage of the cost than the employees. So, it's actually the opposite of cost shift in terms of 2017 versus 2016. I think what's most important, rather than just shift between how much the employer pays versus how much they employee pays is the power of getting incentives aligned with appropriate and well-designed plans to help reduce the overall cost burden of the programs and such overall. So making sure that the smart way design benefit plan helps to bring the cost down for both parties rather than just doing kind of cost shifting as the mechanism for employers to move things. Ana Gupte : Thanks for the color. Appreciate. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Gupte. Our next question is from Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open. Chris Rigg : Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to ask about the Global Supplemental business, particularly relative to where you started the year in terms of guidance and where you ended the year. You outperformed that number by about 20%-ish. Can you give us a sense of what drove that outperformance? And then when we think about 2018, it sounds like there might be some kind of tax impact there. But is there any sort of core reset to the profits that you're assuming given the outperformance in 2017? Thanks. Eric Palmer : Chris, its Eric. I'll start with a couple of comments there for you. So first of all, within the Global Supplemental Benefits business, we're really pleased with the year that we delivered in that segment. That point of three macro drivers in terms of the result that we generated in the course of 2017. First of all, we've had \u2013 continue to have favorable experience relative to our initial expectations. We've had continued growth in the business, we've been -- continue to be very disciplined in terms of the expense leverage and the expense management that we've delivered there. Additionally, at the beginning of 2017, based on where the spot rates were at the time, we had anticipated the potential for some potential foreign exchange headwind, and that has actually turned into a headwind for us. So, those are all pulled together in terms of drivers of our results in 2017. Now, looking forward, the things I would point to in terms of drivers there, we do assume that there would be a bit of normalization in terms of that claim experience as we look ahead to 2018, one. Two, we, as I noted on the tax rate question from a prior caller, we do expect a little bit higher tax rate on that segment going forward. And then as it relates to foreign exchange or FX, no particular headwind or tailwind we'd call out at this point. Chris Rigg : Great. I'll leave it there. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rigg. Our next question is from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open, ma'am. Sarah James : Thank you. First, a clarification on guidance. Interest rate is expected to increase two times or three times this year. So, does guidance reflect increasing interest rates as a benefit to investment income either for the 2018 guidance or the 2021 guidance? Eric Palmer : Sarah, its Eric. As it relates to interest rates, so our guidance and our outlook assume our macro case, which does reflect a bit of rising interest rate. But I note that the impact of interest rates has to play out over a number of years. We tend to be buy and hold investors and as a result, any changes up or down in interest rates outplay themselves out through the P&L over a pretty long period of time. Sarah James : And no material impact on your 2018 guidance then from interest. Eric Palmer : No, nothing that I would call out, Sarah, as a driver. Sarah James : Okay. And in the past, you stated that there is some interest in LTSS. But if I looked historically, companies with a strong Medicaid background are primarily the winners. So, would you be opening -- open to strengthening your process by acquiring Medicaid assets with some mixed books, including high and low acuity? If not, how do you feel that Cigna can get an edge in competing on LTSS without a track record of cost savings and Medicaid? David Cordani : Yes, it's David. Our review has been and continues to be that over time, states will continue to modify their approach to populations both as defined today, but defining on a go-forward basis, additional sub-segments of the population and then seek the vendors, carriers or partners that can give them the best value relative to the populations. As you articulate today, we're not a large player in any of those spaces. But over time, we see that marketplace change as a potential future opportunity for growth and we will leverage both organic capabilities and opportunistically, inorganic activity relative to that. But we think the marketplace is going to evolve over time and this presents an additional possible long-term growth opportunity for us as the marketplace changes. Sarah James : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Sarah. Our next question is from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Your line is open. David Windley : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to come back to Medicare Advantage. David, I think you've talked about 2018 being a year where you will maybe improve margins but not get back to target levels in 2018. So, point of the question number one would be kind of what's your view on glide path on M&A margins? Second that I would presume in that you would expect growth to help you leverage that business and bring margins back up. You've talked about 3% enrollment growth over the course of this year. It looks like your performance, at least in the AEP [ph], was strongest in what would have been HealthSpring and Bravo had a long-standing markets and less well in maybe some of the more recent expansion markets. Curious what that -- what your views are? What that tells us about the ability to expand that HealthSpring specific model into adjacent markets? And how you view that over the next year or two? And then finally, STAR's mitigation and how that influences that growth as well over the course of 2018 for 2019? Thanks. David Cordani : Yes, packed a lot in there. So, maybe quickly and simply, we see further margin expansion opportunity period relative to the line of business over time both driven by disciplined performance in the MOR range as well as expense leverage that you articulated. So, we'll opportunity to further expand the margin over time. Second, your articulation of the growth profile in terms of the immediate timeframe is right. That was deliberate in terms of our positioning of those market places, and it further validates or reinforces that where we have highly aligned value based physician relationships, the performance and the value return to customers, beneficiaries and physicians is quite strong, but we don't -- the value proposition is a bit less strong. As I mentioned in prior remarks, we're delighted with the fact that we now have multiple markets with quite mature, highly performing collaborative where we have demand from those physician groups or integrated hospital systems to aggressively enter the M&A marketplace over time. So, it's a good reinforcement and learning relative to the value having the aligned physician relationship and the proven performance, as opposed to starting that build from scratch. Lastly, relative to STARS, we were in 2018, about 60% from a four STAR+PLUS plan with all of our mature markets by one performing where we expected it today. For 2019, we are optimistic that we will get recognition to the proper positioning of our products and our capabilities. Our Net Promoter Score and [Indiscernible] outcomes continue to be quite strong and we have multiple leverage and tools to work with CMS to ensure they were properly positioned for 2018. So we are looking forward to the 2019 selling season. David Windley : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you Mr. Windley. Our last question will come from Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI with Evercore ISI. Mr. Newshel, your line is open. Michael Newshel : Hey good morning, thanks for taking me in. So, last summer you had announced collaboration with CVS to leverage pharmacy interactions in the clinic. Is there any change to how you see that evolving given that pending transaction with Aetna? And are you considering doing anything similar with other partners? And also is there any change you are thinking about the future of your PBM relationship with Optum given the recent actions among your peers? David Cordani : So Michael two points, you are correct. First stepping back we are \u2013 we view partnering with others as a critical capability. In fact you might recall from a investor day dialogue being the undisputed partner of choices and have borne strategic comparative to continue to drive the right value for our customers and clients and as we go forward. That relationship we entered into the CVS down in Florida was an innovation that both parties wanted to do to try to drive improved outcomes. We don\u2019t have any discernable deliberate differentiated outcomes to point to at this point in time, but it\u2019s indicative of our test and learn approach, our collaboration and are willing historically multiple partners, so you could view that is indicative of both today and in the future which would be to have multiple partnership arrangements up in running today. As it relates to the PBM, as Eric articulated we delivered a pharmacy trend in 2017 potentially zero with high clinical outcomes and continue to grow that business. So our proprietary owned PBM continues to perform quite well, back to partnership we have an orientation round, willingness and ability to partner with others to increase value for the benefit of our customers and clients and I think its a spectacular example of smart, well aligned partnership capabilities and being able to deliver better value for customers and clients is indicative of high clinical quality outcomes growing the platform and zero medical cost trend. So we view partnership as mission critical on a go-forward basis and a lot of bright spots to point to over the recent past. Operator : Thank you Mr. Newshel. I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani. David Cordani : Thank you everyone. Let me just move to wrap up our call with a few headlines. First, overall we delivered very strong result in 2017 with key performance across all of our priority growth platforms. Commercial employer, U.S. Senior, Global Supplemental Benefits and Group Disability & Life led by delivery of continued industry leading medical cost trend. In addition, in 2017 Cigna grew to serve more than 95 million customer relationship worldwide. Relative to overall expectations for 2018, we will continue to create differentiated value for our customers and clients and as a result for your shareholders through consistent focus on delivering affordability and personalization as well as partnering with healthcare professionals to ensure our customers receive the highest quality healthcare. Each of our four growth platforms remains well positioned for sustained growth, in addition we have an exceptionally strong ongoing capital position. We expect to deliver revenue growht inline with our long term objective of high single digit growth rates and we have an outlook for 2018 that anticipates a 19% to 23% EPS growth rate over 2017 all of which gives us confidence to increase our long term EPS target from $16 per share to $18 per share by 2021. We thank you for joining our call today and look forward to further conversations. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 results review.

LLC Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by for Cigna's First Quarter 2018 Results Review. At this time all callers are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter queue to ask questions at that time. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference including the question-and-answer session is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell. William McDowell - Cigna Corp.: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's first quarter 2018 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2018. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders' net income, is contained in today's earnings release which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements including statements regarding our outlook for 2018 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, I note that in the first quarter, we recorded an after-tax special item charge of $50 million or $0.21 per share for transaction-related costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of financial results. Also, as previously disclosed, effective January 1, 2018, Cigna adopted the new accounting standard titled Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASU 2014-09, which addresses recognition of revenues under GAAP. Cigna has adopted this accounting change on a retrospective basis for the first quarter of 2018 and has recast prior periods. Additionally, as we discussed at our Investor Day in 2017, we see significant opportunity for growth in the lower end of our Middle-Market segment, employers with 250 to 500 lives, as employers of this size share many of the characteristics and needs of our Select segment clients. As a result, beginning with the first quarter of 2018 for Global Health Care, Cigna is classifying employer clients with 250 to 500 lives in the Select segment, where they were previously classified in the Middle-market segment. Prior-year lives have also been reclassified to reflect this definition. Also, consistent with past practices, when we make any perspective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior development of medical costs. Finally, our outlook for 2018 does not reflect the impact of Cigna's combination with Express Scripts, which we continue to expect to close by the end of 2018. And with that, I will turn the call over to David. David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Thanks, Will. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'll begin by highlighting Cigna's very strong quarterly financial results, which continue our consistent track record of growth and value creation across our portfolio of businesses. I'll then discuss how a combination with Express Scripts advances our proven growth strategy by accelerating our ability to provide greater affordability along with expanded choice and broader distribution reach, all with greater predictability. Eric will then address our first quarter results in more detail as well as our outlook for meaningful growth in customers, revenue and earnings in 2018. We'll then move to the Q&A portion of the call, and following Q&A, I'll conclude the call with a few closing comments. I'll start with some highlights of our results. For the first quarter of 2018, consolidated revenue increased 9% to $11.4 billion. First quarter earnings increased to $1 billion with earnings per share of $4.11. Turning to our business segments, Global Health Care revenue increased by 10% with very strong earnings growth. This outstanding result was led by our Commercial Employer business, which once again delivered differentiated organic growth in both risk and ASO medical customers, particularly in our Select and Middle-market segments. Our Commercial Employer business also delivered attractive margins and sustained industry-leading medical cost trend. And in our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we grew revenue by more than 20% over the first quarter of 2017, with earnings increasing to $112 million. Collectively, our first quarter results reflect strong momentum across our portfolio of businesses and give us confidence we will achieve our improved outlook for 2018, earnings and EPS. Our first quarter performance also highlights the significant value we create through our integrated offerings. Cigna's continued and long track record of value creation is especially evident in the Commercial Employer space, where our focus on deep integration of medical, pharmacy, behavioral health and other specialty solutions enables us to more comprehensively support the health needs of our customers and as a result, deliver differentiated value. Integrating these solutions, coupled with aligning incentives and leveraging our leading engagement and transparency tools, has been at the foundation of Cigna's ability to deliver better clinical outcomes, industry-leading affordability through our differentiated medical cost trend, continued organic customer growth in each of the past eight years, and strong margins and free cash flows. As we look ahead, health care costs continue to grow at an unsustainable rate with poor or eroding individual health status contributing to this unsustainability. This is caused by consumer behaviors and lifestyles, an aging population and a rising chronic disease burden, all in an environment that has historically been volume-based sick care intervention system with misaligned incentives. Today, pharmacy is the most widely used health care benefit. At the same time, pharmacy also presents a leading opportunity to close gaps in care and follow evidence-based care. All too often, individuals fail to adhere to their treatment plans or are given treatment plans from multiple physicians without coordination. Over time, the combination of increasing utilization and high manufacturer prices for prescription drugs has resulted in pharmacy trend growing at multiples that are three times or more CPI rate, which is simply not sustainable. Specialty pharmacy, in particular, is the fastest growing medical cost category. Over the next decade, specialty drug costs are expected to more than triple from approximately $300 billion today to more than $1 trillion. As a result, rising specialty pharmaceutical costs are a top concern for employer clients and, with the right capabilities in place, represent a tremendous opportunity for value creation. Against this backdrop, it has become more critical than ever to holistically manage and coordinate medical, pharmacy, and behavioral care in order to reduce cost to a sustainable level, preserve health or improve health status and improve outcomes. These critical needs are at the center of our proactive decision to combine with Express Scripts. Our combination will accelerate our growth strategy by creating deeper alignment across critical elements of the health care system including health plans, service providers, physicians, hospitals, pharmacists and pharmaceutical manufacturers, all to drive improvements in affordability and clinical quality. Together with Express Scripts, Cigna will be even better equipped to continue delivering differentiated value for our customers and clients, our health care partners and our communities. We will deliver solutions through a strengthened and expanded portfolio of integrated medical offerings and a new health services operating unit. This new operating unit will offer an array of solutions including pharmacy services, specialty pharmacy care, behavioral health services and population health and decision support, all with the appropriate data management and security firewalls in place between the services and medical platforms to ensure the protection of competitively sensitive data. By bringing together our complementary capabilities, our combined company will operate from an improved medical and pharmacy cost position that will directly benefit our customers and clients. And it will leverage an open-architected or choice-based model that expands offerings for the people we serve while strengthening and expanding our partnerships with health care providers. Our combination will also strengthen our ability to contribute to better cost predictability, which we recognize is a priority for employers, individuals, health plans and government agencies. Leveraging Cigna's capabilities and long track record of innovation, we have the ability to offer customers and clients a broad portfolio, ranging from full guarantees to shared risk models and service-based offerings, all built to address the financial predictability, service and clinical outcomes our customers and clients are seeking. With Express Scripts, we'll be better equipped to understand, support and inform physicians based on the breadth of data the combined company will be able to generate from the billions of customer touch points we'll have. While we have existing tools in place today, this wider and deeper data set will meaningfully accelerate our progress and provide us with more actionable insights into both customer and physician behavior. And as a result, we'll be even better positioned to provide best-in-class cost performance, clinical quality, customer and physician service, and predictability. As we look toward this next phase, it's also important to highlight the fact that each company brings a highly complementary clinical capability to support this goal. More specifically, Cigna employs more than 4,000 clinicians. Express Scripts employs more than 3,000 clinicians and each organization has a proven ability to partner with clinical professionals and pharmaceutical manufacturers to deliver strong and differentiated results. Together, our collective experience, expertise, and capabilities will result in a broader portfolio of aligned and integrated offerings, offerings that deliver differentiated affordability along with predictability for customers, clients, and providers, and deeper outcome-based relationships with health care professionals and pharmaceutical manufacturers. A direct result of creating differentiated value in the marketplace is creating differentiated shareholder value. The combined Cigna and Express Scripts will be well-positioned to deliver attractive growth and strong financial results, coupled with exceptional strategic financial flexibility. The combination will drive growth for expanded and strengthened integrated medical offerings in our Go Deeper geographies and our new health services offerings will meaningfully expand the distribution reach of our services across the United States. Additionally, both companies operate highly capital-efficient businesses, which facilitate the company's ability to continue driving strong margins and ongoing free cash flows. This, in turn, will position us to continue making investments in the business to further drive expansion and innovation. It also provides us with ongoing strategic flexibility with respect to additional M&A opportunities as well as for share repurchase activity. We see this optionality and financial flexibility as a significant strategic advantage in this highly dynamic and changing environment. Now, to summarize a few key points before I turn the call over to Eric. Cigna began 2018 with very strong momentum across our portfolio, with each of our businesses well-positioned for growth over the balance of the year, providing us with confidence we will achieve our increased outlook for EPS growth this year in a range of 23% to 27%. Looking ahead, we are excited about our combination with Express Scripts, which we expect to close by the end of this year. This acquisition positions us to continue building on and accelerating our results by driving deeper alignment across critical elements of the health care system, all to further improve affordability, expand our addressable markets, and deliver outstanding financial results with strong financial flexibility. With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna's first quarter 2018 results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year. I will also discuss our capital position and outlook for 2018 as well as following the close of our acquisition of Express Scripts. Key financial highlights in the quarter are consolidated revenue growth of 9% to $11.4 billion, consolidated earnings of $1 billion led by exceptional growth and strong margins in our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits segments, quarterly earnings per share of $4.11, and continued strong free cash flow and financial flexibility. Overall, our results demonstrate continued strong performance across the enterprise. Regarding our business segments, I will first comment on Global Health Care. First quarter operating revenues in Global Health Care grew 10% to $9.1 billion, driven by commercial customer growth, premium increases consistent with underlying cost trends and inclusive of the return of the health insurance tax, and specialty contributions. We ended first quarter 2018 with 16.2 million global medical customers, an organic increase of 327,000 lives year-to-date, driven by growth in our Select, Individual and Middle Market segments. We grew customers in both risk and ASO funding arrangements as our industry-leading trend results continue to resonate with the market. First quarter earnings in Global Health Care were $871 million, reflecting growth in medical customers and specialty relationships, continued effective medical cost management and a lower tax rate compared to 2017. Turning to our medical care ratios, our first quarter 2018 total Commercial medical care ratio, or MCR, of 73.7% reflects ongoing strong performance of our Commercial business, particularly from our integrated medical platform, the pricing effect of the resumption of the health insurance tax and favorable prior-year reserve development. Our first quarter 2018 total Government MCR of 84.5% reflects strong performance in Medicare Advantage through our advanced physician engagement model and normal Part D seasonality. First quarter 2018 Global Health Care earnings included favorable prior-year reserve development of $43 million after-tax compared to $61 million after-tax in first quarter 2017. Moving to operating expenses, for first quarter 2018, our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 22.7%, which reflects ongoing investments in growth and innovation, continued effective expense management and the impact of the return of the industry tax, which added 110 basis points to the expense ratio in the quarter. Overall, we've had a very strong start to 2018 in our Global Health Care business. Turning to our Global Supplemental Benefits business, operating revenues grew 21% to $1.1 billion, or 15% on a currency-adjusted basis. First quarter 2018 earnings grew to $112 million, reflecting business growth and strong operating expense management. This business has once again delivered outstanding top and bottom line growth as we continue to deliver affordable and personalized solutions that meet the needs of our customers. For Group Disability and Life, first quarter operating revenues were just over $1.1 billion. First quarter earnings in our Group business were $67 million, reflecting solid disability performance and modestly elevated life insurance claims. Overall, Cigna's fourth quarter results reflect strong customer, revenue and earnings growth, led by our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits segments. Now I will discuss our outlook for 2018. In 2018, we expect to continue to deliver strong financial performance for our shareholders by continuing to provide industry-leading medical cost trend management, leveraging our differentiated capabilities to deliver more affordable and personalized solutions, and continuing to invest in capabilities to better serve our customers and clients. For full year 2018, we continue to expect consolidated revenues to grow in the range of 7% to 8% over 2017. Our outlook for full year 2018 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $3.17 billion to $3.27 billion, or $12.85 to $13.25 per share. This represents an increase of $0.35 to $0.45 per share over our previous expectations and represents earnings per share growth of 23% to 27% over 2017. I will now discuss the components of our 2018 outlook starting with Global Health Care. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of $2.67 billion to $2.73 billion, an increase of $50 million to $70 million over previous expectations, reflecting continued strength in both our Commercial and Government businesses. Key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2018 include the following. Regarding global medical customers, we now expect growth in the range of 400,000 to 500,000 lives over year-end 2017, an increase over previous expectations, reflecting the strong growth we have seen across our Commercial market segments to date. Turning to medical costs, for our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we continue to expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 4% to 5%. Through our integrated medical platform, we continue to align incentives for our customers, clients and physician partners driving positive health outcomes and better management of total medical costs. Now turning to our medical care ratio outlook. For our total Commercial book of business, we continue to expect the 2018 MCR to be in the range of 77.5% to 78.5%. For our total Government book of business, we now expect the 2018 MCR to be in the range of 83.5% to 84.5%, reflecting a decrease of 50 basis points over previous expectations and driven by strong performance in Medicare Advantage. Regarding operating expenses, we continue to expect our 2018 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%. Now turning to our other segments. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth and now expect earnings in the range of $390 million to $410 million, an increase of $10 million over previous expectations, reflecting continued strong results in this business. Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we continue to expect full year earnings in the range of $330 million to $350 million. Regarding our remaining operations, that is other operations and corporate, we now expect a loss of $220 million for 2018, which is an improvement over previous expectations. So all in, for full year 2018, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $3.17 billion to $3.27 billion, or $12.85 to $13.25 per share. This represents an increase of $0.35 to $0.45 per share over our previous expectations. I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior-year reserve development or any future capital deployment. I will now discuss our 2018 capital position and outlook. Our subsidiaries remain well-capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with a strong return on capital in each of our business segments. Regarding free cash flow, we ended the first quarter of 2018 with parent company cash of $1 billion. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we continue to expect capital available for deployment to be $2.8 billion in 2018. Thus far, in 2018 we have deployed $130 million of parent company cash to repay current maturities of long-term debt and we have repurchased 1.3 million shares of stock for approximately $275 million. As previously discussed, we do not expect to conduct additional share repurchases prior to the closing of the Express Scripts transaction. Looking ahead to our combination with Express Scripts, as David indicated earlier, the status quo and health care spending is not sustainable, and our combination with Express Scripts will position us to accelerate our strategy by driving deeper alignment across the health care system. As a combined company, we will drive greater affordability through an improved medical and pharmacy cost position, deliver better health outcomes and more predictability for our customers and clients, and have an expanded reach through our existing integrated health business and newly created services operating unit. Driven by the value creation from these capabilities, we expect to deliver attractive margins through a highly capital efficient operating model. The combination will be immediately accretive, delivering mid-teens accretion in the first full year, post-close, excluding any contribution from Express Scripts transitioning clients and excluding revenue synergies. As a result, we also raised our 2021 earnings per share target to a range of $20 to $21, an increase of $2 to $3 per share from our prior guidance. The combined organization will generate strong free cash flow which will enable our debt to capitalization ratio to return to the 30s within 18 to 24 months following closing. Importantly, while we will prioritize debt repayment in the two-year period following the close, the strength of our capital efficient businesses will also allow for additional capital deployment in both 2019 and 2020. For additional capital deployment during this time period, our strategy and priorities remain, providing the capital necessary to support the growth of our ongoing operations, pursuing targeted M&A activity, as well as returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase. Looking forward, we project the combined company will generate free cash flow of at least $6 billion in 2021. As David noted, this strong free cash flow and capital deployment optionality positions Cigna to be nimble to continue to innovate in the dynamic environment in which we operate. Now to recap, our first quarter 2018 results reflect strength in our diversified portfolio of global businesses and a continuation of our track record of effective execution of our focused strategy. Overall, we are pleased with our strong start to the year driven by the fundamentals of our business and are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full-year 2018 earnings outlook. From this position of strength, we are excited about our combination with Express Scripts, which positions us to accelerate our growth strategy and which will generate strong free cash flow to deliver significant financial flexibility for ongoing investments and capital deployments to drive further innovation. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Our first question comes from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yes, I was just hoping you could talk about the growth in commercial risk that you've seen this quarter. And we're framing it in the context of attrition that we've seen at several of your large peers, so it's a little bit surprising, and if like you could just address how you would achieve that in this environment. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Yeah, Matt. It's Eric. I'll start. With respect to the growth that we delivered in the quarter, as David noted in his prepared remarks, again, this is our eighth year of consistent growth in terms of organic commercial enrollment. We approach the market with growth in both self-funded and commercial risk products and really work to ensure that we've got the best funding arrangements for the needs of our clients and customers. Overall, I would point to the increasing recognition of the trend in the cost performance that we've been able to generate for our clients across all the funding arrangements as the primary driver of our success in the growth cycle coming into this year. And we've had good growth in both self-funded and risk products to show for it. Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): If you can comment, are you expecting growth will continue over the balance of the year? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Our growth continues to come primarily from the Select and Middle-market segments. And those segments do tend to be spread more throughout the year, so we're optimistic about the trajectory for additional growth across all of our funding arrangements in those segments over the balance of the year. Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And maybe I can just ask one last question which is just an early view on your setup for the Medicare Advantage products going into the 2019 open enrollment. Not looking for guidance, but just to understand, do you see this upcoming season as being a normal one after you've had a period of recovery? David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Hey, Matthew. Good morning. It's David. Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, David. David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.: So first and foremost, we're excited to be back in the growth mode in our Seniors business. For 2018, we expected to turn the business back from a growth orientation and we expect to build some of that growth momentum throughout the rest of this year. We started with very strong retention results and starting to add some new sales. Specific to 2019, the team is excited. We're well-positioned for 2019. We're also oriented around further geographic expansion in 2019, 2020, and 2021 as we look forward. So the team's on their toes right now and we're excited to restart that growth engine with some increasing momentum. Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Fantastic. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. This question's for David. I think you and Eric both have spent a lot of time since the Express deal was announced meeting with shareholders, talking to them. I guess I'd invite you to share what do you think is the biggest concern and pushback shareholders have about the transaction, and what is the response that you've been sharing to that concern? David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Gary, good morning. You're correct. We continue an open dialogue consistent with our culture. I think first off, big picture, stepping back, shareholders recognize the fact that Cigna has had and continues to have, as evidenced by this quarter, a consistent strong track record of success, momentum, growth, and earnings growth, so understanding the strategic accelerant that is either perceived to be necessary or being pursued. Second piece of the conversation is just a rapidly evolving environment and better understanding how the additional capabilities position us not just for today's business but the evolution of tomorrow's business. And in those conversations understanding that further improvement of medical cost or affordability is mission critical. We've put forth the strategic objective of further stepping down medical cost trend from our industry-leading levels as a strategic objective for the future at a CPI level, because we think that's what the market demands and that's what is possible with a well-run organization. And then helping the market understand the fact that we're going to deliver outstanding financial results even without the revenue synergies we've talked about. So putting that whole picture together, I think the appreciation for the strategic value, the financial value and the forward-looking strategic flexibility and optionality is being better understood today. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Taylor. Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Just conceptually, you beat, I think, the consensus by almost $0.70-plus, and you raised the guidance for the full year by $0.35 to $0.45. I know there's a number of reasons why that might happen. Maybe internally, your forecast was higher than what the Street had, maybe just being conservative earlier in the year, maybe there was a pull-forward or something else. I guess first question would just be to get your perspective on that dichotomy, the really strong beat and a strong raise but not quite as much as you beat by. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: A.J., it's Eric. I would just note we're really pleased with the strong start that we've had to the year. I wouldn't call out anything in particular in terms of dynamic there, other than just it's early in the year. We're pleased with the momentum that we've got and excited about the opportunity to be raising our guidance over the balance of the year at this point, but nothing else I'd call out in particular. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then, obviously, one of the areas of outperformance was on the MLR/MCR. One of the things we've been hearing from people \u2013 both hospitals and from at least one of your peers \u2013 was potentially an increase in acuity on the inpatient side. Again, there's several reasons for that. One is the industry may be very effective in pushing the low intensity stuff into the outpatient side, or there may be an increase in these higher acuity patients. I wonder if you could indicate maybe where in particular you saw positive trends on the medical loss ratio? And specifically on that acuity question, are you seeing anything unusual there? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: A.J., I wouldn't call it anything unusual in terms of acuity or anything along those lines. Our medical cost trends are performing consistent with our expectations and the guidance that we set back when we provided 2018 guidance in February. We continue to be in the range of 4% to 5% which we think is a great result for the year. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Want to stay on the Commercial segment and sort of a two-parter here. Commercial MLR was a lot lower than we were looking for and I know there's some seasonality around some of the products, et cetera, but I'm just curious how sustainable you think that quarterly result is. And then I kind of want to juxtapose that with this mid-market sort of stop-loss product. We heard from Humana yesterday for the first time on one of their calls speaking specifically around that product. So are you seeing more competition? Do you think margins are sustainable there? Is that just a growing market that feeds everybody or do you think you're starting to see new entry there? David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Josh, good morning. It's David. Let me start talking about the market and the, I'll call it, the acceptance and the trends relative to the product, and then ask Eric to expand a little bit relative to just our outstanding result for the quarter and how it unfolds. First, more broadly, as you know, 85% of all of our Commercial lives are ASO and we like the transparent funding mechanism to drive alignment. So it comes all the way back to the philosophy of driving alignment with the employer, greater transparency and the dynamism that happens throughout the course of the year to be able to work with the employer to try to optimize results for their employees, our customers. Stop-loss is an important part of that portfolio as you come downmarket to provide peace of mind and predictability relative to the cost outcomes and we've been doing this for a long, long time. Secondly, as we've discussed before, we've talked about the fact that the evolution of the transparent funding mechanisms continued to be broader accepted in the marketplace beyond the legacy of middle-market, but the broader market continues the option and we see that trend moving forward. And lastly, we have expected over time to see additional competition coming to this marketplace. That's a good thing because it's reinforcing of the tremendous demand for this product and service. We like the fact that we have a dedicated unit, dedicated technology, dedicated resources and very importantly, continued investment in innovation and services around the expansion, if necessary, to drive this on a go-forward basis. So we see an optimistic future for this portfolio as we look to future. I'll ask Eric to give you some color relative to our very strong MLR and how it shapes over the rest of the year. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Hey, Josh. It's Eric. Just on the MLRs, as David noted, we're really pleased with the performance that we delivered in the first quarter here. Would expect that that would follow, I'll say, a normal seasonal pattern as we move throughout the course of the year, I mean, ultimately, the Commercial loss ratio for the full year landing in the 77.5% to 78.5% range that I talked about in my prepared remarks. We think that's a great result and we're on track to deliver it. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Great. And if I could just throw one more out there, the life insurance claims, you talked about sort of a slightly higher than expected life insurance claims. Maybe just talk a little bit about the product and the funding. Just want to make sure this is just the traditional life. Maybe mortality rates increased a little bit, nothing more than sort of industry factors there. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Yeah. Josh, on the Life businesses, is just a pretty plain vanilla group, employer-sponsored and voluntary life set of products where employees may elect additional coverage, things along those lines. There's some variability in this from period to period. We saw higher claims in the month of March specifically, but have seen the month of April, for example, has been right back to where we were expecting. So again, we do just see variability from time to time in this business and I would note that as the driver for the results in the first quarter here. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. I guess I want go back to maybe follow up on an earlier question about the investor feedback around the Express deal. Because I guess from what I've heard, I think the things that you've outlined around the opportunities here I think are pretty clear but the concerns tend to be more around the core underlying performance of a PBM, I guess Express in particular but maybe to the PBM market broadly. Just wondering as you've spent some time talking to investors, you had more time to talk to Express about the issues, is there anything that you can kind of provide to us to give us comfort around the work that you've done to kind of say that the earnings profile of Express going forward is in fact more or less what the market believes that there is sustainability? Or if there's any levers that you think that, as a combined company, Express might not have on its own, that give you that confidence that the pro forma numbers into 2021 will play out. David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Kevin, it's David. So a couple different dimensions to your question. First and foremost, let me start with the basic chassis and that is the fact that Express continues to deliver strong performance to their clients that they serve each and every day, as evidenced by their very strong retention rates. So you come back in a dynamic market of servicing commercial employers, sophisticated health plans, governmental agencies, strong retention rates are reinforcing a high-value creation. The second piece to the core of your question, the whole notion relative to the earnings profile, the sustainability of the earnings, just to spend a moment on that, it's clear that Express has a strong margin profile relative to its traditional competitors. Unlike their traditional competitors that they're benchmarked against, Express Scripts is focused in the pharmacy space exclusively and, as such, doesn't have other lines of business to, kind of, cross margin against or otherwise. Additionally, the market better understands through some of the disclosures that have taken place in the ongoing dialogue that Express' portfolio of business is a little different. So a broad commercial portfolio, but that commercial portfolio has both large national accounts and smaller national accounts and therefore the margin profile is little different from that standpoint. Secondly, that they have a broad services portfolio they offer to the marketplace that doesn't correlate to the facilitation of prescriptions being fulfilled, yet they have the revenue and earnings from that. Hence, it makes the margin profile per script look a bit higher. So a little better visibility into that from the filings that have taken place. But at the end of the day on a go-forward basis, whether it's legacy Cigna, legacy Express, or anybody else, the ability to capture value for the shareholders is totally predicated on the ability to deliver value for clients and customers. And the visibility relative to just the sheer size and the impact of pharmacy, specialty pharmacy, medical, behavioral being better coordinated to deliver an outstanding cost and quality outcome, we believe, is being better understood, because that's the fundamental market need. And the combined company's going to have the ability to take market-leading trend already and step it to another level, which is going to be key to being able to deliver value to clients and customers and, as a result, capture value for the benefit of shareholders. And to me, that's the core of the dialogue. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. And then just, when you talk about the MLR for the two businesses, you threw prior-period development in the Commercial explanation but not in the Government explanation. So I assume that most of the PPD was in Commercial. And yet, you lowered your MLR in Government and kept it in Commercial. So just wanted to understand that dynamic, if there's anything going on there either at the Government or the Commercial business. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Kevin, it's Eric. We reported favorable prior-year development in both the Commercial and the Government businesses, skewed more on the Commercial side or end of the book. But the Commercial book is quite bit bigger than the Government book as well. And so again, nothing I would call out as particularly notable or anything along those lines. Again, pleased with the performance in both so far, year to date, and the visibility that we had to the outlook for the full year on a Government basis led us to lower the loss ratio there. But again, overall, good momentum in both. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research you may ask your question. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the membership growth. I mean, I'm sure you guys realize this, but you're significantly differentiated from your peers here in the first quarter at least. It looks like just in the first quarter versus 4Q, you guys added about 150,000 Commercial group members, while your peers shrunk by about 750,000. So can you give us some more color in terms of products, geographies, markets, where you feel like you're seeing momentum, or anything you're doing differently here? David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Justin, good morning. It's David. First I appreciate the callout relative to significantly differentiated. And just come back, as Eric and I noted, we have eight years of growth in the commercial space and it's been disciplined growth. Coming back to the geographies, anchor back to our Go Deep or Go Deeper orientation first and foremost. We seek to be higher focused geographically. Second, it's really imperative to anchor this back, as Eric articulated before, off of the multiple years of differentiated medical trend delivery. Third, as we've discussed in the past, we have continued to pour significant resources into innovation of products, programs and services. For example, the Cigna One Guide offering that was rolled out in 2017 to 2 million customers. In 2018, we'll have 4 million customers being serviced by that. So an evolving chassis through that dimension. And lastly, as you may recall, we profiled in our Investor Day \u2013 and as Will noted in his opening comments \u2013 we profile that our view was that we had significant headroom, for example, in the 251 to 500 life employer space. And we reoriented and aligned the team relative to that and expanded our density of orientation. And we saw meaningful progress in the 250 to 500 space as well. Broadly speaking, by way of funding mechanism philosophy, our team uses our broad portfolio, from ASO, ASO stop-loss, shared returns and guaranteed costs, and we're really pleased with what the team was able to deliver with outstanding retention and good new business adds. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And just as a follow-up there, it was interesting just because I thought your ASO, this would be a year where you would take share in self-insured that just given the HIF coming back, anybody with guaranteed risk is going to be taking a big price increase. So the fact that that didn't happen, and you're seeing what seems like more competition on that ASO and stop-loss business chassis, whatever you want to call it, is it possible that you've now kind of evolved that to say, instead of just shared risk or instead of \u2013 where you'll get some upside if things are better, are you stepping out even further and guaranteeing that upside? Have you changed any of your pricing methodology around that ASO and stop-loss to just take the next step to guaranteed cost? David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Justin, it's David. First, consistent with our past dialog, we have not viewed nor have we seen that the implementation of the HIF, pausing the HIF, re-implementation of the HIF, et cetera. We've had the posture that that doesn't change the purchasing patterns broadly. It doesn't change what and philosophically how an employer's going to buy. You're either going to orient around transparency or not, you may get a little movement on the margin. So point one. Point two is we've invested meaningfully into evolving our portfolio of services with dedicated platforms, dedicated distribution resources, dedicated client management resources and evolving the products, programs and capabilities. And we like our portfolio of services. To the point you made, we have not had a pricing philosophy change. Our pricing philosophy is very consistent, as evidenced by our really strong client retention levels to come back to delivering on our promises and delivering an outstanding medical cost trend. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. You may ask your question. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. I know it's early and we're sort of in the midst of the 2019 selling season, but any general views of kind of what you're seeing or hearing whether we're likely to see less movement in Commercial next year just given some of the pending deals? Or if it's a big RFP calendar both in terms of your renewals and new business? David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Ralph, good morning. It's David. So, relative to 2019, your question points toward mostly, essentially, the national accounts marketplace, so a little color there. Before I give you color, just to remind everybody, we define national accounts a bit differently than our competition. So, for us, a national account is a commercial employer with 5,000 or more employees that are multi-state. So, our focus is very clear there. Specifically, relative to point-in-time today versus point-in-time last year, the amount of RFPs we have to look at are about equal year-over-year and the portion of our portfolio that's out to bid is about equal year-over-year. So, we see consistency through the volume. The only double click-down I would give you there is still the intensity and momentum of the market looking for just proven incentive engagement-based programs, further evolution of proven points of integration to deliver step functions of affordability, health improvement, productivity improvement. That intensity just continues to mount over time and we're well-positioned to step up to those opportunities. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Right. That's helpful. And then just to follow up on that, I guess I do want to drill down a little bit on the national account book and just want to get your views of sort of looking ahead. How much of a focus will that be? Why is it that sort of the Select and smaller end of the market has been more receptive, I guess, to your strategy in terms of the growth you've seen than the national account book? And then, I'm hoping you can give us the overlap of your national accounts that carve out to Express Scripts. Thanks. David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Yes. So, Ralph, two dimensions there. Dimension number one, to be clear, we continue to perform well in national. We pick our spots because what we're looking for is the philosophical alignment with what the employer is seeking to do and we try to go really deep in those relationships. And you may recall from our prior conversation, we value the depth of the relationships and the cross-selling and the integration of services, and we've seen continued further deepening of those relationships. And that enables us to deliver outstanding medical costs, that enables us to deliver strong retention and further expand those relationships going forward. We grew our national accounts relationships in 2017, and we see the opportunity to continue to grow both in the traditional marketplace as well as importantly on a targeted basis on the private exchanges. Specific to the second part of your question, think about a 10% to 15% overlap, hence, flip it around the other way, massive opportunity. And we've talked about those opportunities in the past between the Cigna and the Express portfolio of relationships. So, we see tremendous upside and opportunity there. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. Your next question comes from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to triangulate some of the comments around the Commercial enrollment and, frankly, the MLR beat with the return of the HIF and I guess strong enrollment gains, some of the comments we've heard from your competitors. I guess I'd be interested in just understanding if high deductibles or just higher deductibles in general gained more traction this year than in years past in a way that might drive increased seasonality in the business, and whether that might've been a part of the thought process as you considered how much of the upside in Q1 to flow through to the guidance. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Yeah. Steve, it's Eric. Couple of dimensions to that. So, first of all, with respect to deductibles and the like, I wouldn't actually call out a particular change in terms of the overall book of business and such. Our customers in 2018 have about the same cost sharing as they had in 2017, and there hasn't been a pronounced shift there. In any given year, there's different dynamics as the terms of the seasonality of the quarterly pattern of the loss ratio evolves, as you think about the impact of the amount of stop-loss in the portfolio, the amount of the Commercial business, the timing of the sales and the makeup of the individual book of business. But again, overall, pulling those pieces together, we think we're well on track for the strong result that we've communicated previously. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. It's great to hear. Just one follow-up on trend. I think it was on the 4Q call where you sort of outlined expectations of an acceleration in utilization. Are you actually seeing that? And if you could talk to maybe inpatient versus outpatient, both utilization and pricing that you're seeing, that would be helpful. Thank you. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Sure. So, as we noted coming out of 2017, we delivered a particularly strong trend result in 2017, finishing the year at 3%. We did note that we assumed and expected a bit of a utilization uptick coming into the year. Overall, wouldn't call out anything particular in terms of areas of increase and such, but more that we were just making sure that we had an outlook that was allowed for a bit of an uptick relative to 2017. As you think about the different service categories and such, overall, would continue to note inpatient and outpatient both in kind of that mid-single-digit sort of a range, but all consistent with the outlook that we provided three months ago. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Tanal. Next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. You may ask your question. Steve J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Great. Thanks. Good morning, David and Eric. So, I hate to beat the medical cost trend questions to death here, but I had sort of a similar question to some other folks just on the dynamics around favorably reducing the Government MLR guidance but leaving the Commercial MLR guidance unchanged, even though there seemed to be that bigger delta, favorable results on the Commercial side. Is there just anything noteworthy or magical about changing one and not the other? Thanks. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Yeah, Steve. It's Eric. Overall, I would just say it's early in the year, and I think that we're off to a good start. But I would note it's early in the year, so again, nothing along those lines. As I noted in one of the other answers, just the impact and the size of the Government business. We had visibility given the PYD that we've delivered, and the track record or the results in the first quarter led us to lowering that ratio. But, again, nothing else that I would call out underneath the numbers. Just early in the year and again, off to a good start. Steve J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our next question comes from Ana Gupte the Leerink Partners. You may ask your question. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Following up again on the Mid-Market and Select growths and what you're expecting to see post the deal close. Think Mid-Market, you've grown year-over-year single digits. Select is well into the teens it looks like. What type of feedback are you getting from the Mid-Market and Select brokers and the employers on the cross-selling value proposition Express to Cigna and vice versa? David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Ana, good morning. It's David. Our dialogue with clients as well as brokers, and we've had significant interaction post the announcement, macro, favorable reaction. Why favorable reaction? Expansion of capabilities to further improve affordability, expansion of services and flexibility of offerings, so very positive. You may recall as we've talked about the additional uptick from a revenue standpoint that the new franchise will be able to deliver beyond the base case of both organizations. We did identify the ability for further uptick within the legacy of Express as it relates to additional growth opportunities. Additionally, in a prior question, I indicated the modest amount of overlap in the relationships that exist today. So, big picture, I'd say energy and optimism, twofold. One, the ability to further step up and further deliver differentiated affordability, which is job number one. And secondly, the broadening of services that will be available through either side of the channels, whether it's the integrated medical or the services-based offering, both being received very favorably in the market. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Great. Thanks. And then following up on the affordability point, you've guided to $600 million in synergies on admins and we're taking that to the bottom line. So, I'm assuming given the price sensitivity in those markets that you are looking to pass through some of your medical cost synergies into the employer customers. And what is kind of the driver of that and what is the timing? And as you even look into the 2019 selling season, might you be thinking about what you might do together? David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Ana, it sounds like you're trying to negotiate a rate renewal with us right now, but specific to your question, you're correct. And to be very clear, it's important. We've committed the expense in administrative-oriented synergies back from a shareholder standpoint and we were clear on the date of the announcement. We expect to flow the preponderance of all the medical and pharmacy savings back to customers and clients because we seek to drive further step function and affordability. As you might imagine, that intent and that strategic direction is being received favorably in the marketplace and we look forward to being able to carry that forward as quickly as possible there after closing the combination. So, we couldn't be more excited about it to further build on the affordability momentum we have today with yet another step function of good value for the benefit of clients and customers. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Gupte. Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. You may ask your question. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. Can you tell us about \u2013 one of the opportunities you see some of your competitors exploring that you guys have not explored with Medicare Advantage group business. How many of your commercial retirees at this point \u2013 commercial members are retirees and that could be an opportunity for you to convert into Medicare Advantage group lives? David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Peter, good morning. It's David. First, macro, we don't have that data point disclosed. Stepping back, you identify a future growth opportunity that is not lost on us in any way, shape or form. So, we continue to be excited and optimistic around our Medicare Advantage growth chassis, both in the individual market as well as the opportunity over time relative to the group space. We have not pursued that, as you noted. We have stayed focused in an incredibly Go Deep orientation to drive the individual chassis but, over time, we see a significant opportunity there. We're clearly aware of what that number is. We just don't have that number disclosed and we see that as a future growth opportunity for us. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Has that risen or declined over the last year or two as your competitors start rolling these products out more and more aggressively? Are they coming into your customer base? Or are you still retaining most of those retirees within your customer base and that what they're actually having is mostly just conversions of their own commercial group into Medicare Advantage? David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Experience has been pretty stable and we don't see disruption relative to our customer base at this point in time. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Terrific. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Costa. Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Your enrollment guidance increase suggests that you are expecting enrollment growth over the balance of the year. Your revenue guidance maintenance, I can kind of get beyond that by just annualizing the first quarter. I wondered if there's a mix disconnect that I'm not thinking about, or what might be the reason that we wouldn't see revenue grow at more like double digits just annualizing the first quarter. Thanks. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Dave, it's Eric. Nothing I would note in particular, I think. Over the balance of the year, we would expect to have growth in the Select and Middle-market segments across a range of funding arrangements. We'd also expect the individual book will attrit consistent with the normal pattern over the balance of the year until you pull those pieces together and you get to the range that we've talked about. Again, we're pleased with the early momentum that we've got from a customer base perspective and from a growth perspective, but just that kind of evolution of the mix of funding arrangements over the back half of the year, that lands you still at the 7% to 8% growth. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Super. I appreciate that. I don't think I've read or heard any call-out with regard to flu. Was there a quantification of flu impact? And did that end up being lower than you expected, or in line? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Yeah, the flu season overall, we had pretty good visibility into when we provided our guidance back at the beginning of February. It played out pretty consistent, so I would note it as a variance kind of one way or the other in terms of our performance so far this year or in our outlook. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : And if I can sneak in one more, David. Competitively, are you seeing competitors creating networks that favor owned delivery assets? And is that a competitive challenge or opportunity for you? David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Dave, macro, generally speaking, no. Over time, we expect to see that as a potential. We see it more as an opportunity than not. We believe the more choice, partnered, open-access framework and the alignment around that is superior based upon needs and buying behaviors so long as the cost quality equation is there and we've been able to prove an outstanding cost quality equation. So, big picture, to-date, no. See it as a potential change in the future and we think that change creates more opportunity for us than not. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Windley. Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Stanford Bernstein. You may ask your question. Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yeah. Morning, guys. Just had a question strategically. Following the Express Scripts merger and ultimate integration of that, what are the additional strategic capabilities that you feel you need to add? And how would you prioritize things like local market scale, government program growth and vertical integration with risk-bearing providers? David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Good morning, Lance. So, you recall we have a very clear set of priorities relative to M&A. Your question was premised on what we have to add. We will be extremely well-positioned post the combination and we're excited for that. We remain focused in terms of five categories of M&A so long as they are strategic as well as financially attractive. And to remind you, they further our global footprint, they continue to perform quite well, further our U.S. seniors capabilities, further our physician engagement and pharmacy capabilities, further our retail base capabilities and over time, expand our state-based risk program capabilities. So, our orientation, if you look back, has been very consistent with the five priorities we put forward. We don't prioritize one over the other. We dynamically seek to identify the best opportunity in any of those categories as the marketplace evolves and we'll continue to be optimistic around that. Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And just a quick question on pharmacy membership for the quarter. It looked like the pharmacy cross-sell rate may have declined a little bit in the quarter. Just wondering what drove that, kind of who won that business and if there were any changes in how you're going about cross-selling that? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: The decline of the PBM lives for the first quarter was primarily driven by the loss of a large national account relationship. Looking over the balance of the year, I'd expect pharmacy lives to grow as it's a key element of the integrated offering that we have in our Select and Middle-market segments. And obviously, the combination with Express scripts will position us to even more effectively serve those clients on an integrated or on a stand-alone basis. Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Got you. And I just note that in your prepared remarks, David, you mentioned your clients and an expansive view clients including health plans and you mentioned pharma manufacturers a number of times. I was wondering just kind of your perspective on how you look at pharma manufacturers and kind of the orientation of them as clients and how you might service them going forward. David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Yeah. Lance, thanks. It was referring to the pharma manufacturers in terms of opportunities for alignment opportunities for value creation, et cetera. So, coming back to orientation around partner of choice, coming back to orientation around driving value-based outcomes, we believe it's imperative in the next chapter of health care in the United States to find some of the success that the marketplace has seen and we have seen in aligning incentives around collaboratives, or otherwise, with physicians or hospitals carrying that same philosophy much more deeply and much more comprehensively into the pharmaceutical manufacturing environment because, again, the cost curve cannot continue to be borne by society. And we see a tremendous opportunity to step-function the value creation for clients and customers working with forward-looking pharmaceutical manufacturers. That was the intent of that comment. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Wilkes. Our last question comes from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning. Most of mine have been answered, but I did want to go back to the guidance just one last time. And maybe this is an Eric question. When you look at the strong results in the quarter relative to the amount of guidance raised and you look at just the EPS contribution in the first quarter, it's obviously a lot higher than what you historically run. So I'm just curious, is there any final thoughts, this is the last question, in terms of just the cadence over the course of the year that we should be mindful of when we work the quarterly progression out to get to your guidance? Thanks. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Frank, I appreciate the question. The dynamics here, I would call, would be all kind of normal things. But I would note the following in terms of things that will shape the seasonal pattern over the balance of the year. First is just the normal seasonal impact of deductibles and the normal impact of things like Part D and the like. And with the deductibles, in particular, as you know, as you move throughout the year, those have an upward increase on the cost end of things, one. Two is the rate and pace of spending on our capabilities, including the impact of some of the investments that we've talked about in terms of tax reform and those sorts of things. We expect that those will come in over the back part of the year, as well as spending on our readiness for January 2019 selling cycle. And then, third would just be the impact of the 2019 industry fees suspension that'll come back out of rates as we get closer to the 2019 timeframe and such. And so, again, we've seen this dynamic in the past when the industry fee comes and goes in terms of the impact that it has on the seasonal pattern and the like. Those would be the things I'd encourage you to think about as you look at the overall pattern. But again I'd reiterate, off to a great start this year and really confident in our ability to deliver the results and the guidance that we put forward. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Morgan. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Thank you. To wrap up our call, I just want to reiterate a few key points from our discussion. Cigna delivered very strong first quarter financial results, which continue our consistent track record of growth and value creation across our well-positioned portfolio of businesses. Our results reflect strong momentum across our portfolio, led by our Commercial Employer business, which once again delivered strong organic medical customer growth, particularly in the Select and Middle-market segments, attractive margins and continued industry-leading medical cost trend. Collectively, our first quarter results reflect strong momentum and give us confidence we will achieve our improved 2018 outlook for earnings, EPS growth and customer growth. Our first quarter performance also continued Cigna's long track record of value creation in our employer customer space through deep integration in medical, pharmacy behavioral and other specialty solutions that enables us to more comprehensively support the health needs of our customers. Looking ahead, our combination with Express Scripts will position us to continue to build on this track record and will accelerate our growth strategy by creating deeper alignment across critical elements of the health care system to drive improved affordability and clinical quality and will result in attractive financial results, exceptional free cash flow and capital flexibility. We thank you for joining our call today and look forward to our future discussions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's First Quarter 2018 Results Review.

At this time all callers are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter the queue to ask questions at that time. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the question-and-answer session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell. William McDowell - Cigna Corp.: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's second quarter 2018 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2018. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on this same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders' net income, is contained in today's earnings release which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements including statements regarding our outlook for 2018 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, I note that in the second quarter we recorded an after-tax special item charge of $109 million, or $0.44 per share, for transaction-related costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of financial results. Also, consistent with best practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior-year development of medical costs. Finally, our outlook for 2018 does not reflect the impact of Cigna's combination with Express Scripts which we continue to expect to close by the end of 2018. With that, I will turn the call over to David. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Thanks, Will. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Today I'll begin by highlighting Cigna's second quarter financial results which reflect substantial revenue and earnings growth, with outstanding performance in each of our business segments. Next I'll highlight how Cigna's differentiated service-based model fueled by actionable insights and analytics continues to drive value in a dynamic market environment, and how this value creation will be further accelerated by our combination with Express Scripts. Regarding our combination, I'll also provide a brief update relative to the overall market forces, the Department of Justice and state level review process and the integration planning work that Cigna and Express Scripts teams are advancing together. Eric will then address our second quarter results and our increased full year 2018 outlook in more detail. And then following Q&A, I'll conclude the call with a few closing remarks. Turning to the quarter, we had exceptionally strong second quarter operating results where we delivered double-digit revenue growth, 27% earnings growth and continued industry-leading medical cost trend. For the second quarter, consolidated revenue increased by 10% to $11.5 billion and our earnings per share increased 34%to $3.89. Turning to our business segments, in Global Health Care, we increased revenue by 12% while driving earnings growth of 34%, with strong contributions from both our Commercial and Government businesses. In our Global Supplemental Benefits business, Cigna grew revenue by 16% over the second quarter of 2017, with earnings increasing to $118 million. And in our Group Disability and Life business, earnings grew 24% relative to the second quarter of 2017, to $103 million. I would remind you that our results are building off a very strong 2017 result. Our results for the first half of 2018 demonstrate tremendous momentum across our portfolio of businesses and these results give us confidence we will achieve our increased 2018 outlook. Now stepping back, we continue to operate in a highly dynamic and disruptive environment, with evolving competitive, governmental and technology forces. Within this environment, significant gaps remain into how health care is accessed, consumed and financed, which places tremendous pressure on individuals, employers, governments and health care professionals. To date, much of the societal dialogue has revolved around health care expenditures which are rising at about three times the overall inflation rate. But the conversation, too often, overlooks the more fundamental challenges of improving individuals' health and maximizing the value of health services when they are consumed. We believe that Cigna's differentiated service-based model, fueled by actionable insights and analytics, embraces market challenges, drives more effective partnerships with our clients and with health care professionals, improves health outcomes and addresses the root cause of escalating costs, and openly delivers superior experience and value for our customers. I'll provide two examples that illustrate how in a highly localized fashion our service-based model enables us to partner with clients and health care professionals to achieve superior outcomes. I'll begin with a client example. Cigna worked with the city of Naples, Florida to incentivize and support our customers in achieving personalized health goals, measuring progress through changes in body mass index, tobacco usage, cholesterol and a variety of additional metrics. As the program gained traction, our collaboration grew to include other biometric outcome-based goals as well as Cigna's MotivateMe preventative care screening program. Today, the program includes even more extensive resources, ranging from exercise and healthy cooking initiatives to fitness challenges and health fairs, all focused to help employees meet their health goals. Fast forward approximately three years from the program's inception, and Cigna's helped the city of Naples achieve a series of powerful health outcomes, including an annual well visit completion rate that is now nearly 35% above industry norms, and breast cancer screening rates that are 13% above industry average. In addition, Naples has realized substantial returns on investment through our population health and disease management programs, and for the past four years has had no premium increase for employees or for the city. Let's look at the second example. This one involves a health care partner. In 2013, Cigna formed a collaborative accountable care partnership with Franciscan Central [Central Indiana]. Franciscan is a large health system of provider groups in hospitals throughout Indiana. Franciscan has embraced the use of Cigna generated data, including quarterly, monthly and daily reporting to help manage performance in critical areas of care quality and cost. We established incentives focused on a number of costs and quality measures, including 17 distinct clinical and customer experience indicators, such as in the areas of diabetes care, depression management and a variety of preventative care measures. Through the work of our collaborative arrangement, Franciscan is delivering exceptional care with demonstrable improvements and market outperformance in a wide variety of clinical quality measures. For instance, last year, their patients with new episodes of major depression achieved medication adherence rates that were 36% better than market. And in 2017, Franciscan achieved a medical cost trend that was a full 700 basis points better than the market. The city of Naples and Franciscan Central are just two examples of how Cigna has successfully delivered industry-leading medical cost trend over the last five years and are on pace to do so again in 2018. Now while we're pleased to be delivering these strong results for our customers and clients that we serve, we recognize that today's health care environment continues to be disruptive, with market forces continuing to push for greater affordability and overall value from care delivery and health care services. For example, pharmacy costs have rapidly grown and now compromising (sic) [encompassing] nearly 25% of overall cost equation in the United States. And specialty pharmacy, which is two-thirds of this category, is the fastest overall growth category in health care. Further, pharmacy services continue to be a leading cause of gaps in care which are inconsistent delivery of evidence-based care for customers. Our combination with Express Scripts is directly responsive to these market forces and further accelerates our strategy of Go Deep (sic) [Deeper] (09:30), Go Local and Go Beyond. More specifically, the combination will enhance our ability to further improve affordability, expand our distribution reach and further strengthen predictability for our customers and clients, all while maintaining significant financial flexibility and delivering attractive returns for our shareholders. Recognizing that more than 150 million Americans have at least one chronic disease, customers and clients want and need access to appropriate medications and coordinated care management programs all at the lowest total cost. Cigna and Express Scripts have individually distinguished track records with this approach, with Cigna delivering 0% pharmacy trend in 2017, and Express Scripts delivering 1.5% pharmacy trend in 2017, each leading our respective care groups. To be clear, the health care supply chain's reimbursement mechanisms, including rebates, discounts and the like, are complex. At Cigna, we believe strongly in the need and case for change and will drive further alignment for value, simplification and transparency. Relative to the current state, Express Scripts customizes solutions to meet the complex needs of some of the largest and most sophisticated employers and health plans in America. For these clients, Express Scripts provides advanced clinical management programs, medication safety programs, specialty care access, coordination and care delivery, as well as home delivery pharmacy services, just to name a few. Cigna and Express Scripts share the goal of ensuring customers have the highest level of access to the right medications and therapies in a clinically coordinated fashion at the lowest overall cost. And each company seeks to manage all the levers and tools to achieve this goal on behalf of our respective clients and customers. Rebates are one component of the reimbursement mechanism for pharmacy services. Regarding pharmacy services specifically, Express Scripts passes through approximately 95% of purchase discounts price reduction to rebates back to the commercial and health plan clients. Additionally, almost half of Express Scripts clients have opted for full direct pass-through arrangements specific to rebates. For these cases, clients agree to different funding and financing arrangements to pay for the services they are consuming. This demonstrates that amongst a variety of funding arrangements that exist today, clients are able to choose the services and funding arrangements that best fit their objectives. As we look to the future, our combination with Express Scripts, we look forward to further accelerating incentive alignment, care coordination and value-based delivery for customers and clients aided by expanded transparency. This includes a meaningful expansion of outcome-based relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, where they are rewarded for superior clinical outcomes rather than simply for the consumption of drugs. The next key milestone of our combination with Express Scripts is on August 24 when both companies hold their special meetings with shareholders and seek shareholder approval. As we've discussed previously, we strongly believe that the combination is in the best interest of our shareholders as it delivers immediate and long-term value for our shareholders in the form of strong EPS accretion, significant free cash flow generation and exceptional financial flexibility in a dynamic marketplace. Transitioning through the regulatory approval process, we are making good progress on both the federal and state levels. On the federal side, we are actively working with the Department of Justice as they conduct a review of our transaction and as we respond to their second request. We will maintain an active dialogue with the Department of Justice over the course of the review, and we expect to be in position to certify our compliance with the second request this month. As is customary in second request reviews, we have entered into a so-called timing agreement with the Department of Justice that, amongst other things, gives them 90 days, after we certify substantial compliance, to complete the review of the transactions. We will use that time to continue to actively engage with the Department of Justice on any questions that may arise. On the state side, we continue to make good progress where we already have Form A approvals or exceptions in approximately 40% of the states where that filing is required. At the same time, the Cigna and Express integration teams are working very well together as we prepare to operate as a new company, and even stronger company. Tim Wentworth and I, with senior members of our respective teams, are leading the integration management office. Our 11 integration work streams are organized around the overarching objectives of approving affordability, expanding our addressable market and further strengthening predictability for the benefit of our clients and customers. We are very pleased with the progress we have made to date. Our integration work has reinforced our shared view of the marketplace and of cultural alignment between our organizations, including our mutual focus on the needs of our customers and patients as well as clinical partnerships where we have the opportunity to deliver additional value. As a result, we have even greater confidence in our ability to create value for the benefit of our customers and clients, and for you, our shareholders. Now to summarize a few points before I turn the call over to Eric. Cigna once again delivered outstanding results in the second quarter with substantial revenue and earnings growth. Taken together, our continued momentum across our portfolio of businesses gives us confidence we will achieve our increased 2018 outlook. Looking ahead, we believe that Cigna's differentiated service-based model, fueled by actionable insights and analytics, embraces market challenges, drives more effective partnerships with our clients and with health care professionals, improves health outcomes and addresses the root cause of escalating costs and ultimately delivers superior experience and value for our customers. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Eric. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll briefly review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter 2018 results and provide an update to our full year outlook. I'll also discuss our capital position and free cash flow generation which remain very strong and will be meaningful enhanced through our combination with Express Scripts. Key financial highlights in the quarter are consolidated revenue growth of 10% to $11.5 billion; consolidated earnings growth of 27% to $955 million, including double-digit earnings growth in each of our ongoing business segments; quarterly earnings per share growth of 34% to $3.89; and continued strong free cash flow and financial flexibility. Our results this quarter and for the first half of this year demonstrate continued focused execution of our strategy and underscores strong fundamentals across our businesses. Regarding our business segments, I'll first comment on Global Health Care. Second quarter operating revenues in Global Health Care grew 12% to $9.2 billion, driven by Commercial customer growth and expansion of specialty relationships as well as premium growth, reflecting the return of the health insurance tax and underlying cost trends. We ended second quarter 2018 with 16.2 million global medical customers, an organic increase of 329,000 lives, year-to-date, led by growth in our Select, Middle Market and Individual segments. We continue to earn the right to serve more medical customers in both risk and ASO funding arrangements as our industry-leading trend results continue to resonate with the market. Second quarter earnings increased 34% to $789 million, reflecting growth in medical and specialty customers, continued effective medical cost management and a lower tax rate compared to 2017. Turning to our medical care ratios, our second quarter 2018 total Commercial medical care ratio, or MCR, of 76.3% reflects ongoing strong performance of our Commercial business powered by our integrated medical solutions, better-than-expected results in our U.S. Individual business, and the pricing effect of the resumption of the health insurance tax. Our second quarter 2018 total Government MCR of 83.7% reflects solid execution in both Medicare Advantage and Part D. Second quarter 2018 Global Health Care earnings included favorable prior-year reserve development of $23 million after-tax. Moving to operating expenses, for second quarter 2018, our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 22.7% which reflects ongoing investments in growth and innovation, continued effective expense management and the impact of the return of the industry tax, which added approximately 100 basis points to the expense ratio in the quarter. Overall, our Global Health Care business delivered very strong results in the second quarter. Turning to our Global Supplemental Benefits business, operating revenues grew 16% to $1.1 billion. Second quarter 2018 earnings grew 12% to $118 million, reflecting business growth and strong operating expense management. This business continues to deliver very attractive revenue growth and margins as we further deepen our customer relationships and broaden our distribution capabilities in our targeted markets. For our Group Disability and Life segment, second quarter operating revenues were $1.1 billion. Second quarter earnings in our Group business grew 24% to $103 million, reflecting favorable life results, solid performance in disability and a lower tax rate. Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, our second quarter results reflect strength across each of our business segments as we delivered strong customer, revenue and earnings growth. Now I will discuss our outlook for 2018. We expect 2018 to be another year of exceptionally strong financial performance for Cigna. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenues to grow approximately 8% over 2017. Our outlook for full year 2018 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $3.34 billion to $3.42 billion, or $13.60 to $13.90 per share. This reflects an increase of $0.65 to $0.75 per share over our previous expectations and represents per share growth of 30% to 33% over 2017. I will now discuss the components of our increased 2018 outlook starting with Global Health Care. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of $2.83 billion to $2.87 billion, reflecting continued strength in both our Commercial and Government businesses. Key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2018 include the following. Regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect growth in the range of 400,000 to 500,000 lives over year-end 2017, reflecting the strong growth we have seen across our Commercial market segments. Turning to medical cost, for our total U.S. Commercial Employer book of business, we now expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%, an improvement of 50 basis points versus our previous expectations. As David discussed, this industry-leading medical cost trend is aided by our strong partnerships with health care professionals and employer clients. Through these partnerships, we align incentives to reward healthier behaviors for individuals, higher quality care delivery and more effective management of total medical costs. Now turning to our medical care ratio outlook for our total Commercial book of business, we now expect the 2018 MCR to be in the range of 77% to 78%, an improvement of 50 basis points versus our previous expectations. For our total Government book of business, we now expect the 2018 MCR to be in the range of 83% to 84%, also an improvement of 50 basis points versus our previous expectations. Regarding operating expenses, we continue to expect our 2018 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth and now expect earnings in the range of $400 million to $420 million, reflecting the strength of the results in the second quarter. And regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we continue to expect full year 2018 earnings in the range of $330 million to $350 million. Regarding our remaining operations, that is other operations and corporate, we continue to expect a loss of $220 million for 2018. So all in, for full year 2018, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $3.34 billion to $3.42 billion, or $13.60 to $13.90 per share. This represents an increase of $0.65 to $0.75 over our previous expectations. I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior-year reserve development or any future capital deployment. Now moving to our 2018 capital management position and outlook. Our subsidiaries remain well-capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with strong return on capital in each of our business segments. Regarding free cash flow, we ended the second quarter of 2018 with parent company cash of $1.2 billion. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we continue to expect capital available for deployment to be $2.8 billion in 2018. As a reminder, in the first quarter of this year, we deployed approximately $130 million of parent company cash to repay current maturities of long-term debt, and we repurchased 1.3 million shares of stock for approximately $275 million. As previously discussed, we do not expect to conduct additional share repurchases prior to the closing of the Express Scripts transaction. During the second quarter of this year, we announced plans to acquire OnePath Life Insurance from ANZ Bank in New Zealand. This acquisition, which we expect to close by the first quarter of 2019, enables us to go deeper in an existing geography with an expanded set of solutions and capabilities to create more value for our customers and exemplifies our continued focus on, and capacity for, effective capital deployment to drive long-term growth. Looking ahead, our pending combination with Express Scripts greatly enhances our capital strength and flexibility, enabling us to accelerate our ongoing investments and market-leading capabilities, and to deploy capital to drive additional growth and value creation. As communicated previously, we project the combined company will generate free cash flow of at least $6 billion in 2021. As David noted, we're making good progress in our planning for the integration with Express Scripts and our work to date has reinforced our confidence in achieving the targets we have set for the combined company. We are excited by the capabilities our combined company will have to drive continued innovation and growth while maintaining financial strength and flexibility as we deliver differentiated value to our customers, clients and our shareholders. Now to recap. Our second quarter 2018 consolidated results reflect strength and momentum in our diversified portfolio of global businesses and continued effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals of our business remain strong as evidenced by these results, which reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from each of our business segments, ongoing strategic investments in differentiated capabilities for the benefit of our customers, clients and health care partners, industry-leading medical cost trend and high clinical quality and continued strong free cash flow. Based on the strength of these results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year 2018 earnings outlook. We look forward to accelerating our growth strategy through the Express Scripts combination and delivering on the very attractive financial commitments we have established for the combined company. And with that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : One moment please for the first question. Our first question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Hi, everybody. I appreciate all the comments around the transaction, what you're doing, maybe I'll try to flesh out one other aspect. You're about six months since the announcement, not quite, but close to it. I guess if I think about what's developed in the last six months, you've had obviously the selling season for 2019 for pharmacy benefit managers, you've had the Trump administration come out at least at a high-level with some blueprint for change, which I know, David, you alluded to a little bit in your comments. And you've had this period of integration that you've been working with these integration teams. I wonder, A, is there anything that you would highlight? It sounds like you're at least as confident as you were day one. Are there any specific things that you've learned from any of these three items that you'd highlight for us that makes you either feel better or that present modest challenges for you as you go forward? And I guess I should technically ask you, do you reaffirm \u2013 are you reaffirming the year one double-digit guide \u2013 accretion and the long-term $2.00 to $3.00 per share accretion that you think you can get out of the deal? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: A.J., good morning, it's David. A lot in that, let me try to address it. So relative to 2019 selling season, maybe a specific piece and then stepping back more broadly, and then I'll address the accretion framework. On the 2019 selling season, if you process the facts that Express put out yesterday afternoon, it reinforces very strong performance, starting with as we like to talk to a Cigna, retain, expand, add. So their strong performance that they put forth in the second quarter with their results reinforce very high and exceptionally strong client retention levels, that's validation of value proposition delivery; expansion of services through additional clinical programs, be they clinical programs, medication safety programs, specialty programs, et cetera, and some very exciting new wins. So it portends for market dynamism where the clients continue to look for total cost, total quality value creation, which is on strategy for Express, on strategy for Cigna and will be on strategy on a go-forward basis. More broadly, your points reinforce a very dynamic environment, and we stepped into this combination expecting and projecting a very dynamic environment, as I noted in my prepared remarks, from governmental forces, from competitive forces from the ever present push for further affordability and value, and I think some of the items you referenced reinforce that. Within our integration planning work as I noted, our teams remain quite excited both in what we are doing but in the way we're working together; the commonality of cultural focus on customers or patients, the respect and collaboration with the clinical community, and the targeted points of innovation and value creation, and the significant amount of affordability improvement we'll be able to drive together, including clinical quality and service improvement leveraging our collaboratives, we remain even more excited relative to that. As it relates to the environment, I, think in a nutshell, it reinforces strategic flexibility, capital flexibility, a cultural commitment to change and innovation, and partnering with the clinical community to drive quality improvement and affordability improvement. As it relates to financial outcomes, yes, we remain committed to mid-teens accretion in year one and significant accretion, as you noted, within the 2021 EPS number we put out of $20 to $21 a share. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Great, and maybe just a quick follow-up question. I think you're the only one, at least of the national companies, that have updated their medical cost trend outlook favorably this quarter. Any particular areas where you're seeing better results? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: A.J., thanks for noting that, our trend results really continue to reflect the power of our integrated model and the effectiveness of aligning incentives across clients and customers and health care professionals. And as you know, we've got a large portion of our book or 85% of our U.S. Commercial customers is self-funded, so this is their money and their savings that goes directly to their benefit. In terms of the different categories of trend, I wouldn't call it anything in particular. We continue to see all of inpatient, outpatient, professional and pharmacy in that low to mid-single digits range, overall, just seeing a bit of favorability as we've gotten through the first half of the year, and line of sight into the improved result that we put out this morning. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. I wanted to go back to your comments about the PBM profitability. You mentioned that Express already has half of its customers in these transparent arrangements, which is a interesting data point to bring up because it shows, in your view, the fact that they can kind of keep their profitability. Do you have any sense of whether the profitability actually is the same in those transparent funding arrangements versus the ones where there is a rebate opportunity? How comfortable are you that the company isn't over-earning in certain parts of its business? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Kevin, good morning. First, specific to the macro term of over-earning, as we noted and as you very well know, Express as well as Cigna, but speaking specifically of Express, they are serving some of the largest most sophisticated commercial employer clients' health plans and, obviously, of governmental agency business as well. So you have very advanced buyers, very advanced process, whereby they value the quality of the services in the overall value equation that Express is able to deliver. As I noted, they deliver an outstanding medical cost trend result. And if you go back and look at their disclosures from yesterday, they indicate that through the first half of this year, they're on track to deliver a better result than that. Last year's result was 1.5% trend. They're on track for the first half of this year to deliver a better result relative to that. So point one, it all comes down to the aggregate value delivery for those clients, be they health plan clients, be they commercial clients, et cetera. Express also continues to innovate in the area of clinical programs, medication safety programs, care coordination programs, formulary optimization programs and their leadership in specialty care, all that comes together such that they're able to get a basket of services that work for clients and a basket of economics that work for Express and their shareholders. Specific to parsing the economics, no, I can't parse the economics between a partial pass-through and a full pass-through but, in aggregate, the return profiles are attractive because the returns to those clients are very positive and attractive as reinforced by their outstanding client retention levels and continue to expand those relationships. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. And I guess as really the follow-up question on that, how comfortable are you in their ability to maintain their margins (34:10) (34:13) David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Look, Kevin, as we've talked in the past \u2013 I'm sorry. Did you have more in your question? Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Well, yeah, I wasn't \u2013 you were saying that (34:21) be able to do this on their own, or the fact that you combined with them actually creates a better positioning to maintain that profitability? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Sorry, you're breaking up a little bit. I apologize for interrupting you. So I don't think it's helpful to parse them alone, us together, et cetera. Stepping back, as we've discussed in the past, at Cigna, we believe fundamentally, that every business has an inherent growth headwind and margin headwind and every business must continue to innovate to deliver more value to its respective clients and customers, to maintain the trajectory or improve the trajectory. So a standalone Express Scripts has to continue to innovate to create more value, as standalone Cigna does, and a combined company will as well. The exciting part is the complementary leverage of the two companies coming together. And take a concrete example : the ability to further accelerate care quality, care coordination and affordability when we're able to average 500 collaborative accountable care relationships like Franciscan that I made reference to in my prepared remarks. So I can't speak for Express on a standalone basis, but every company needs to continue to innovate. And they have a proven track record of innovation. We have a proven track record of innovation. And together, we'll have more capabilities with which to innovate from for the benefit of clients and customers, which is why we're so passionate about, objective number one of the combination which is further improving and meaningfully so, the affordability for the benefits of our clients and customers. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. You may ask your question. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. I guess just sticking on sort of the PBM side of things, will you be proactive in transitioning away from rebate framework? And if not, if there's essentially a force for you to do so, do you think you could sort of \u2013 I guess, and do you expect to maintain profitability or would you expect sort of some hiccups depending on sort of the timeframe that's allowed to make that transition? And then the last piece of that is you talked earlier about meaningful expansion of clinical outcomes. Hoping you could just kind of frame that in terms of maybe where we are to what that opportunity could look like. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Ralph, it's David. So a couple points. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we are quite passionate about the need for and our drive for further alignment, further transparency, and specific to the topic at hand, accelerating the movement to value-based care reimbursement programs, in this case within the pharmaceutical industry, to pay for and reward for superior clinical outcomes as opposed for simply the consumption of drugs or medications. So we are driving that on a sovereign basis. The combined company will drive that on an accelerated basis. We think society at large is better off as a result of that, and the highest performing pharmaceutical manufacturers will benefit as a result of that. But more importantly, individuals and employers will benefit from better quality, better cost through that lens. As it relates to your second subpart of your question, we don't foresee or project a forced march, but we are on a journey to driving that and driving that improvement with and for the benefit of our clients and offering choice with and for the benefit of our clients. And that's the important subset. Clients want a variety of different mechanisms to work for them on their change agenda and strategy, and today we're in position to be able to do so. And the combined company will have even broader capabilities relative to that. As it relates to clinical outcomes, I'll just cite a singular example. We know, and the clinical data supports, that individuals dealing with a chronic disease, and as I mentioned, 150 million Americans deal with at least one chronic disease before you get to the polychronic population, have a multiplicatively higher probability of dealing with clinical depression. I profiled in the prepared remarks the tremendous outcomes in the collaborative with Franciscan in terms of a 35%-plus improvement in medication adherence rates for those dealing with major new bouts of depression. That alone is a coordination between the medical and the behavioral community and incorporating effective, highly coordinated, in that case, pharmaceutical clinical management programs is quite powerful to have the mind-body connection and get the overall quality and overall cost equation to work. The combined companies will have expanded capabilities, for example, including that. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Just switching gears for the follow-up. I know it's early for 2019 guidance, but can you give a sense of visibility around Commercial growth next year coming off of a strong 2018, and with some debate around how much HIIF may have helped the ASO business particularly this year? Thanks. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Yeah, Ralph, so big picture, we continue to feel very good about the Commercial marketplace. And just to reinforce, we have been very consistent in our view that the Commercial marketplace presents an attractive growth market through our orientation around subsegmenting in detail, understanding Commercial clients needs and being consultative to put a proper solution suite together for them, and 2018 marks another strong year for us in terms of high retention, expansion of relationships and new business growth. We're not providing detailed guidance for 2019 as you know at this point in time, but we would expect to continue our momentum in the Commercial space and all the indicators we're seeing, relative to the way in which our value prop or our solutions are resonating in the marketplace today, continues to reinforce. We see a very attractive growth outlook in the Commercial space in 2019, leveraging our proven medical cost trend, our consultative solutions and our integrated portfolio. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you Mr. Giacobbe. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So just another question for me on the PBM. I know we're only at the early stages of Amazon entering the drug dispensing business, and Express Scripts has stated publicly, previously, that they would welcome Amazon as a pharmacy provider in their networks, and would try to work with Amazon, despite the fact that Amazon would be a competitor in mail-order. I guess I'm just curious if you plan to defer to Express Scripts management on that subject, assuming that the merger closes, or whether you have different views on other mail-order dispensers and pharmacy networks? Let me just open the discussion here on Amazon as, obviously, it's perceived as a risk to the PBM business model. Thanks. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Steven, good morning, it's David. As we've discussed multiple times, the marketplace continues to change, the competitive landscape, the supply chain landscape continues to change and evolve. A key tenet relative to the way Cigna approaches the marketplace today and the key tenet relative to the combination is what we talk about in terms of a choice-based customer-centric kind of open architected framework, where you offer to your clients and customers multiple but coordinated touch points or access points to best meet their needs, be they retail in this case, or home delivery, be they face-to-face from a clinical standpoint, or digital or virtual delivery, be they on-site at an employer or how they coordinate it and augment it in a physician's office, et cetera. So it's a deep belief set within the way we run our business within Cigna. And I think, to your point, that you referenced relative to Express' comments, it's reinforced there as a open-mindedness and a relentless pursuit to explore options that increase value for your customers and clients, even if it's disruptive to your current model, your need to continue to innovate relative to that. So we take that same open-mindedness relative to having the multiple modalities, open architected and being open-minded and being a differentiated partner of choice. So we have a similar point of view relative to that. Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Question is just can you remind us, as you considered alternative uses of capital had you not been able to reach an agreement with Express Scripts and/or something from a regulatory perspective would preclude you from doing that, can you just remind us what your alternate use of capital would be? And then, anything changed \u2013 I know you reiterated last quarter the $20 to $21 in EPS in 2021, any change there and/or within the mix of those earnings? Thanks. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Josh, it's David, I'll take the first part, and I'll ask Eric to expand on the second part. So relative to more macro alternative uses of capital, I'm going to step back just to our capital use framework and reiterate our M&A priorities, which we've been quite clear on. First, relative to our capital use framework, as you know, we have highly efficient business portfolio today and we have a successful mechanism of converting a high amount of earnings to free cash flow. To that end, we deploy that free cash flow or discretionary capital in ensuring the businesses have what they need to grow, and fueling our innovation portfolio. Second, high strategic and high financial return M&A and third, returning additional capital to shareholders with our primary mechanism being share repurchase. As it relates to M&A, to remind you of our priorities, when we refreshed our strategy mid-2017, these are not in priority order, but they have to be stated obviously in order to be able to communicate them : further our global footprint, further our U.S. seniors capability, further our physician engagement and pharmacy services capability, further our retail base capabilities, and expand, as we describe, our state-based risk programs as we view that over time, risk programs will continue to evolve from a state standpoint. So our capital framework remains consistent and our M&A priorities remain consistent. For example, Eric referenced in his prepared remarks an on-strategy, highly attractive financial combination we identified in New Zealand that we executed upon. Eric, I'll ask you to speak about the accretion framework. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Yeah. Josh, it's Eric. Just on the $20 to $21, just to step back. We had established a goal of $20 to $21 earnings per share in the year 2021 as part of the combination. We think that's a really attractive result. When we developed that goal, we had a range of different scenarios in mind that could get us to there. So there's not just one scenario that built it to that $20 to $21, rather a range of different scenarios in terms of business environment, context of businesses, et cetera, and we continue to be fully supportive and fully on target to achieve that $20 to $21. Again, continue to stand behind that, and I feel like we're on track to accomplish that Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for the question. Switching topics a little bit. Could you just talk a little bit about the positioning for Medicare Advantage as we get closer to 2019, how you're thinking about pricing and having now come out of the CMS sanctions for a year, how things are progressing versus how you expected? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Good morning, it's David. First, our team, our seniors team as well as our collaborative partners, were really pleased to be back in the market for 2018. I would remind you, as we stepped into 2018, we had a high focus relative to our existing markets. We were unable for 2018 to open up new adjacent counties or new markets for 2018, and we had some counties that we had exited. Overall for 2018, we're tracking about in line with our expectations, but with a good foundation. Importantly, as we look to 2019, we sit in an environment with a bit over 70% of all of our Medicare Advantage customers in 4-star-plus plans. We like that foundation, and we like the strong results we're delivering this year. I would note that Eric indicated, in addition to the Commercial medical cost trends and MCR strength, we had a further improvement of our seniors MCR. As we look to 2019, our team is quite excited relative to the individual MA growth portfolio that we see in our existing markets with our collaborative accountable care partners, the ability to expand in adjacent counties, that that work is, as you'd expect at this point in time, well underway and getting back to opening a new market that is quite exciting for us. So we're very excited about the 2019 outlook, and even more so as we look to 2020 as we build on that momentum, and then get the benefit of the Express Scripts contributions to further affordability improvement for the benefit of both the Medicare Advantage value proposition as well as the PDP. So good base in 2018, momentum building, core performance in 2019 off of that 70-plus-percent in 4-star-plus star ratings, new counties to enter or new markets to enter in 2019, and then further momentum going to 2020. Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. And apologies for asking one more pharmacy benefits question, but in one of the prior responses, you talked about in value-based outcomes working with higher performing manufacturers, can you talk a little bit how you think about that transition and working specifically with pharmaceutical manufacturers? Historically, there's probably a somewhat antagonistic relationship when you think about formulary placements and negotiations. Do you see a similar type of relationship as we transition to value-based care, or is this something that you see as being more collaborative? Thank you. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Zack, it's David. Obviously, the marketplace is going through change. If we step back, there is a singular common force that everything spins around, and that is a relentless need for further improvement in affordability, while we improve quality and service delivery. But that focus by every stakeholder on improving affordability is the centerpiece. And in a way, you could associate your question back to a decade ago-ish, relative to the medical proposition, where the primary way in which \"an insurer\" or health service company works with the medical community, was \u2013 I'll use your words \u2013 a little bit more antagonistic relative to negotiating discounts. And as we've proven at Cigna over the last decade, we now have 500 collaborative accountable care relationships, the vast majority with integrated physician groups, but over 100 with hospital systems where we continue to build on momentum around shared alignment to deliver better value through clinical quality, costs and service quality for their patients or customers and share rewards in a different way. That same attitude, that same orientation, starting with the customer first, needs to be brought back to the pharmaceutical industry. We have some bright spots at Cigna within our PBM where we have some proof-of-concept, value-based care arrangements, but they need to be accelerated dramatically because society at large cannot continue to pay at the current level and in the current consumption-based framework. Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Sopcak. Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning. David, just to come back to the PBM again, Express last night talked about passing through 95% of rebates and discounts for core customers. This is different than the 90% pass-through number that they had talked about previously, post the deal announcement. It appears they added some terminology here, like mentioning discounts as well as rebates and also talked of core customers versus overall. I'm just curious if you could talk to how the 95% number compares to the 90% number in terms of rebate pass-through given all the debate on the topic. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Hey, Justin. Good morning. As you articulate the two different points of measure, both of which are correct. So an isolation of rebates alone, the 90% number, was the pop orientation. The market at large is defining it more broadly. And the economics, when you look at a total cost and total value proposition, you need to look at not just rebates because it's a piece of the equation, an important piece of the equation but nonetheless a piece of the equation, there's discounts, there's other price reduction frameworks, et cetera, that exist to get to that overall value equation. And what I believe Express Scripts did in the second quarter within the disclosure is provide some additional insights that are also more consistent with the way other competitors are talking about the economic flows, which provide again, that framework in terms of the magnitude of the, I'll call it, value creation in pass-through for clients, be they commercial clients or health plan clients, which reinforce why, in many ways, their retention rate is truly outstanding, what I think the statistics they put forth is about 98% retention of their client base and new business growth. So yes, the framework is different but it's more inclusive, it's more indicative of the total cost and total value equation, and it's consistent with the way others in the industry are speaking about it from that standpoint. I would just highlight additionally, as we noted in prior questions and in prepared remarks, there's a variety of mechanisms that work in the way those large sophisticated commercial clients and health plans want to structure their economics, and Express Scripts has a variety of funding mechanisms as Cigna does to be able to meet their needs at a given point in time and evolve them at a given point in time but, hopefully, that helps a bit. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : That definitely does. And just the framework you talked about makes a lot of sense. The discussion of core customers, anything there, like for instance, I'm just curious if they removed Anthem, for instance, when they calculate the 95% because Anthem is obviously going to be transitioning. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Justin, as we have talked about the combination, we've talked about the accretion framework, for example, excluding known transitioning clients and customers. So even the mid-teens we talked about accretion in the first year, that excludes known transitioning clients which are obviously additive to that from that standpoint. And as you articulate, Express has been talking about their business with known transitioning customers in a separate category, because the core of the franchise is the ongoing annuity, that's the ongoing framework, that's the ongoing dynamism. So it's ongoing clients excluding the known transitions. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. So the 90% included all customers, the 95% excludes the transitioning customers. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: I appreciate you rearticulating that. In both \u2013 I would say the 95%, to be very clear, is a more comprehensive measure of all discounts, all price reductions and all rebate mechanisms across their core framework of go-forward customers and clients. The 90% was a separate measure specifically and solely looking at rebates. So I think the instructive part is focus on the 95%, that's the way the industry talks through pass-through economics in the aggregate value creation. It's a more common, inclusive definition, and it's indicative of the health of the underlying book and the ongoing customer portfolio. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Sorry, here. At the risk of beating a dead horse, a couple more on the merger outlook. One, I think where some of the skepticism is focused is on the prospects for Express Scripts on a \u2013 well, I don't want to say standalone because it will obviously be merged with you, but the Express Scripts business' ability to actually grow in the next three years, albeit I know what you've assumed is a very low growth rate. That was my first question. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Matthew, good morning. I'm not sure you asked a question as opposed to made a statement, but let me try to address that. First, the second quarter results, I think, are encouraging relative to the marketplace reception to their evolving value prop and their proven innovation. So stepping back and looking at the retention and the new business growth rate is quite strong. Two, we operate in an environment where we are rapidly approaching 25% of the overall cost equation being pharmaceuticals and two-thirds of that being in specialty pharma, with specialty pharma being the fastest growing overall category. And in some prior dialogues, we articulated that in today's marketplace, specialty pharma is about $300 billion and projected to grow to about $1 trillion of U.S. spend in the next 10 years. So the imperative relative to that care coordination, affordability and value improvement that exists today continues to grow on a go-forward basis. As it relates to the combination, we couldn't be more excited about the ability to further improve affordability. We came forth with a strategic goal aided by the combination to deliver medical cost trend that more approximates CPI in 2021. That's a more sustainable indicator of success. We're well on our journey to deliver that. We delivered a significant step function toward that in 2017, and as Eric articulated, our 2018 results were improved to 3.5% to 4.5%, but the combined company will be able to accelerate even further improvement and affordability on a go-forward basis, and we think that resonates quite well. On a final note to underscore, as you indicated and as Eric referenced before, we do not have revenue synergies in our $20.00 to $21.00 EPS outlook for 2021. That's all upside for us as we're able to prove an acceleration to the value prop. So we like today's base. We like the proof points relative to further improving affordability, and we're confident that, that will further accelerate growth going forward. Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Well said to my non-question question. If I could just add, if the Safe Harbor on the rebating were to be eliminated, let's say, for 1/1 next year, is that something that would impact your outlook in any material way over the next three years? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: So Matthew, clearly, when we talk about a dynamic market, another force of dynamism. So the current dialogue relative to Safe Harbor, as you know, being driven through the administration HHS pertains specifically to the government-based programs, MA, PDP and the like. From our point of view, a change in that in an immediate timeframe, as you articulate, does not materially impact the profitability of MA or PDP, given how those programs are designed and given how the economic flows work. However, I would note our evaluation of it indicates that it will actually increase cost to beneficiaries, not decrease cost to beneficiaries. So we're relatively cautious on that at a unilateral level. More broadly, we do not believe that portends to be a change that will translate into the Commercial marketplace. As I noted, the large sophisticated employer clients and health plans that are currently served, they're focused on low total cost. Additionally, as we've had the discussion here, there's a variety of pass-through mechanisms that work and a variety of tools and financing mechanisms that work whether or not an employer or health plan decides for full pass-through of a rebate, as an example, or partial pass-through for a rebate. So if there was a change in the immediate term, yes, we expect that it would change the mechanisms within MA and PDP. We don't believe it would dramatically change the profit profile immediately from those businesses. We are concerned of the impact on beneficiary costs as it would pass through, and it does not create a change mechanism in the immediate term relative to the Commercial marketplace. Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Your next question comes from David MacDonald with SunTrust. You may ask your question. David S. MacDonald - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning. Just two quick questions. David, I was wondering, can you talk just a little bit about the level of enthusiasm internally amongst your clinical folks just tied to the incremental capabilities from not only Express, but also having eviCore in-house? And then secondly, you mentioned with Express the strong selling season and retention rates, but it also sounds like the penetration level of some of their solutions accelerated pretty meaningfully. So, A, is it fair to say you have meaningfully better visibility on the 2019 Express book? And also, can you comment on the increased ability to bend the cost curve from further penetration of some of those programs? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: So, David, a lot in there. I really appreciate your first comment. Stepping back, both companies are service companies. So if you start with the framework that you're a service company, your team, your talent is mission-critical as it relates to their passion, enthusiasm, desire to improve people's lives, help people, support people, assist in navigation, and in both of our businesses, doing that in a collaborative fashion with the clinical community is quite important. So we start from a really strong framework of a customer-patient orientation, a deep respect for the clinical community and a desire for continuous change. As such, as you articulate, as you came back to the clinical community, while it's broadly a lot of energy in both companies, our clinicians are extremely excited. And when we have our clinical leaders together in terms of the integration work streams, it's hard to calm them down and slow them down relative to the art of the possible, because the leverage effect in terms of the best of both companies to get better outcomes, in terms of what Express is doing extraordinarily well and what Cigna is doing extraordinarily well is really powerful. The two pieces I would highlight further, you articulated eviCore, a lot of energy. We consume their services today as a client and a lot of energy in terms of what we could build on a go-forward basis. And then finally, the power of those 500 collaborative accountable care relationships where we work in a different fashion today with physicians and hospital systems, just a ton of energy relative to accelerating that. To the second \u2013 I'd say second and third part of your equation, yes, both companies continue to make progress relative to deepening our relationships with our clients. But the deepening of relationship with the clients is not so-called cross-selling. The deepening of relationships with clients is driven by deep analytics and insights relative to needs, and then how do you design solutions that meet those needs to further improve affordability and further, to your point, bend the cost curve by improving clinical quality, closing gaps in care, driving additional engagement or care coordination with physicians. We believe that not just the capabilities, but those nuances to how those deepening parts of the relationship and clinical programs evolve, are mission-critical relative to further bending the cost curve. And I would simply assert, based on our proof points, our own Cigna medical cost trend is heavily influenced by those deeper relationships within the integrated framework of our clinical programs and behavioral programs, and the way we work with physicians and it'll fuel us going forward as a combined company. David S. MacDonald - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, Mr. MacDonald. Our next question comes from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just back to the quarter and the results. Clearly, you're continuing to outpace the market on Commercial enrollment growth. Strong results in both ASO and risk, which sounds like you attributed this morning and pretty consistently, frankly, to the cost trend you guys are putting up. But if we're looking at that total Commercial enrollment being up 4% and guaranteed cost up 18%, trying to understand why you think that is. Are there certain elements of the guaranteed cost product that you think are resonating more in the market these days? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Steve, it's Eric. Maybe just a couple of comments on that front. So as it relates to guaranteed cost enrollment being up 18%, it's up about 180,000 or so. Note, first of all, the Individual growth, as an important part of that, is almost half of our guaranteed cost curve. The other portion is the employer portion in terms of year-to-date. I wouldn't call out anything that's changed relative to the guaranteed cost offering versus our shared returns offering or relative to our self-funded offering, other than we just continue to have strong resonance in terms of the message of the integrated offering we bring to market and the effect and the power of the attractive trend that we're able to deliver and such. But again, we're pleased with the performance. It's performing consistent with our expectations and look forward to continuing to grow that portion of the business over the balance of the year. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you Mr. Tanal. Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question. Unknown Speaker : Hi there. it's Dave Stablo (01:04:15) in for Windley. I won't go to the PBM but I'll stick with the Commercial here and just ask a little bit more about the Commercial MLR. So it beat by 250 basis points this quarter and that comes on top of a 230 basis point beat last quarter, and at the same time, you guys had only reduced the full year outlook by 50 basis points. So just trying to get our arms a little bit more around is there a fair degree of conservatism still in that guidance, or do you think perhaps the Street had mismodeled the loss ratios over the first half of the year? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: It's Eric. Thanks for that. Just a couple of things I'd call out in terms of the forward component of the loss ratio \u2013 the Commercial loss ratio versus the year-to-date results. As you think about the back half of the year, the things I'd encourage you to think about, first of all, our guidance does not include the effect of prior-year development. We did have prior-year development in the second half of last year. As you know, we don't forecast that in our outlook, one. Two, we continue to have visibility into the effect and the shape of deductibles in terms of the seasonality as that plays through. Different years have different mixes of business. This year has more Individual business in the risk book, and that carries a little bit more exaggerated shape of seasonality as the deductibles all come on into the effect in the loss ratio in the back part of the year. And then last but not least is there's the pricing effect associated with the 2019 suspension of the Industry Fee. So as we get closer to the January timeframe, we'll be taking the Industry Fee back out of the pricing, consistent with how this has been handled as the Industry Fee has come and gone over prior years, but that will put a little bit of pressure in the back part of the year as well in terms of the metric. Fully contemplated in our guidance, consistent with how we've approached the Industry Fee being a pass-through, but it does cause the metric to move around a little bit over the course of the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Two parts. The first I'm sure you're confident about shareholders approving the Express transaction as are we, but I just wanted to clarify, if the shareholders did not approve the transaction that there's no termination fee that Cigna pays. And the second part was just going back to the Individual market, given the finalization of the short-term medical plans released by the administration last night, as you think about exchange Individual business going forward, are you trying to grow that business in 2019, new markets? And do you think there's a risk of adverse selection from these short-term medical plans? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Morning, Gary, it's David. Relative to the shareholder vote, we are confident in terms of our ability to get a successful vote on August 24 based upon the strategic rationale of the transaction, all the ongoing conversation we have with our shareholders, the very strong accretion profile, the exceptional free cash flow generation, and the significant strategic and financial flexibility which positions, for both short-term and long-term, meaningful shareholder value creation. As it relates to the transaction, the contract obviously is filed as we disclosed previously and I'd invite you to go back and take a look at the contract. Specific to the Individual marketplace, first, in our public exchange business, as you know, we've had a really consistent orientation relative to the market dating back to its inception in 2014, a focused but limited entry into the marketplace and a belief that it was going to be not profitable for Cigna nor the industry at large for 2014, 2015 and 2016, which manifested itself. During that timeframe, we were able to prove some innovations that are working for us around the way in which our collaborative accountable care partners work in that value proposition. We expected to and, fortunately, did turn a slight profit in 2017, and we expected to expand our performance both growth and profitability in 2018 and we're realizing that. As it relates to 2019 and with the change in the marketplace you articulated, we're currently evaluating the marketplace conditions. So it's a pretty dynamic decision-making process. We continue to have a bias to participate, and we highlight the fact that, again, those collaborative accountable care relationships have been integral to enabling our value prop to work for the benefit of our customers, the Individual customers and for the benefit of collaborative partners. And again, our bias is to continue in a highly focused basis, participate in the markets in 2019, but that evaluation is going on as we speak. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Taylor. The next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. You may ask your question. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. A couple days ago, we saw the national average Part D bids, and they were down 11.5%, kind of closer to 13% if you count risk normalization. That's the biggest decline we've seen really since the second year of the program. Do you feel it's more competitive at this point in time? And how does the national average bid compare your bids relative to low-income subsidy members that you have? And what do you think is going on there with the pricing coming down as much as it is? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Peter, it's Eric. I'll be starting, and if David wants to add anything else, I'd certainly invite him to. Overall, this is been a competitive market from the start. We've seen a nice amount of innovation and continued evolution of the structure of the offerings and things along those lines. I wouldn't call out a particular change, but would just note that it's been a competitive market from the start and continues to be a competitive market. As it relates to the specifics of the bids and the like, actually, we weren't surprised by where the statistics came out and such overall. Our bid positioning landed very consistent with our expectations in terms of our region-by-region pull-through, and where we'll qualify under the benchmarks, and the like. We haven't publicly disclosed all of those yet. That will come out later in the year, as you know. But again, the initial read is consistent with our expectations. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And regarding Express, can you comment on their positioning, as well? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Nothing I'd comment on at this point in time. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Costa. Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. You may ask your question. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Thanks for fitting me in. Yeah, David, it's a time as you see of enormous disruption right now, rebates would have thought of going away. Amazon, potentially, getting more than just into mail order. You have health systems like Northwell walking away from Express Scripts in pharmacy, and Ascension coming back into insurance. Your competitors are doing a lot around backward integration into care delivery, but you keep talking about open architecture and your 500 collaboratives. At one point you were happy with your OptumRx third-party relationship on PBM, but then you bought Express Scripts. If something changes and you change your strategy on backward integration, does the land grab for the assets and the scarce resource issue pose a risk at all? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Ana, good morning. You paint a, I think, a pretty interesting picture relative to the marketplace and I think reinforce the fact that the competitive marketplace continues to be an environment of continuous change. Stepping back, we believe, and thus far we've proven that our partnering orientation model with the health care professionals works quite well to get the access profile to work, the clinical profile, and allow and enable the experts to perform what they do, and support and partner with the experts to create even more value for clients and customers. Specific to your point, we are not concerned relative to a land grab or not having access, as this marketplace has continued to evolve, and ebb and flow. We are excited to have a partner-based model, a less capital-intensive model, and a more aligned model than being in competition with a subset of the delivery system partners. And if anything, the changing marketplace right now elevates the proposition of our collaboration, elevates the proposition of working with others for the benefit of their patients and our customers. Having said that, we recognize the marketplace is dynamic. Our strategy contemplates that and is fully oriented around the notion of additional improvements and proven improvements in affordability, clinical quality, with the right service proposition, which includes a more access-friendly framework than an access-light framework. So we agree with the changed environment, but we're really positive relative to our strategic positioning and outlook. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Hey, thanks, David. Operator : Thank you Ms. Gupte. Our last question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. I just want to follow up here on Ana's question. So if we think about the ways that Cigna can move more into point of service, but without being capital-intensive, how is telemedicine factoring into that for you? And are there ways that you can expand your presence there that can complement some of the partnerships that you already have instead of being sort of a competitive factor the way that you thought going into a retail presence could be? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Sarah, good morning. It's David. You touch on another important, we'll call it, channel or modality. So in our model, we view \u2013 telemedicine, in the broadest sense of the word, is it evolves from, we'll call it, traditional care delivery to CARE Coaching to behavioral services and the like, as a tremendous asset and chassis going forward. And it's a mechanism where by having a more choice-based framework, I'll call it, a capital-light framework whereby one is not beholden to owning a tremendous amount of care delivery assets that you have to feed, but rather you're able to offer more choice, we see that as a positive versus not because consumers increasingly want that choice of access, but doing so in a highly coordinated fashion. So for example I had the great pleasure about half a dozen months ago spending time with one of our really meaningful collaborative partners where, jointly, we develop some new tele-med capabilities, but the tele-med fulfillment is actually being fulfilled by them and their care resources. So it's not a, if you will, a channel of conflict for them, it's actually complementary and extending their access, and extending their brand and their reach with their patients but we're doing it together in a highly coordinated fashion and we have the data flows and the information. So you touch on an important part of the innovation that we at Cigna see as positive and then the combined company sees as very positive in terms of our more open-architected consumer choice-based model in partnering with physicians versus an ownership model alone. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ms. James. At this time, I'll turn the call back to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Thank you. So just to wrap up our call, I'd like to reiterate a few points from our discussion. Cigna delivered outstanding second quarter operating results driven by strong performance across each of our business segments. We generated substantial revenue and earnings growth and continued industry-leading medical cost trend. Taken together, our continued momentum across our portfolio of businesses gives us confidence we will achieve our increased 2018 outlook. We believe that Cigna's differentiated service-based model, fueled by actionable insights and analytics, embraces market challenges, drives more effective partnerships with our clients and our health care professionals, improves health outcomes and addresses the root cause of escalating costs and, ultimately, delivers superior experience and value to our customers. We remain on track from a regulatory, integration and shareholder standpoint to close our Express Scripts acquisition by the end of the year. And this acquisition brings exceptional EPS accretion, strong free cash flow generation and attractive strategic and financial flexibility as we look to the future. We thank you for joining our call today and look forward to our further discussions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's second quarter 2018 results review. Cigna Investor Relations will be available to respond to additional questions shortly. A recording of this conference will be available for 10 business days following this call. You may access the recorded conference by dialing 800-391-9847 or 402-220-3093. Thank you for participating. We will now disconnect.",

At this time, all callers are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter queue to ask questions at that time. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen this conference, including the question-and-answer session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell. William McDowell - Cigna Corp.: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me this morning are; David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics including Cigna's third quarter 2018 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2018. As noted in our earnings release when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders net income is contained in today's earnings release which is posted in the investor relations section of cigna.com. In our remarks today we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2018 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, I note that in the third quarter we recorded special items totaling to a charge of $138 million, or $0.56 per share, primarily to reflect the impact of merger-related transaction costs and a litigation matter. As described in today's earnings release special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of financial results. Also, consistent with best practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior-year development of medical costs. Finally, our outlook for 2018 does not reflect the impact of Cigna's combination with Express Scripts which we continue to expect to close by the end of 2018. With that, I will turn the call over to David. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Thanks, Will, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Today I will begin by highlighting Cigna's outstanding third quarter 2018 financial results, which reflect substantial revenue and earnings growth and strength across each of our business segments. Next, I will discuss, how our ongoing effective execution of our strategy continues to drive Cigna's ability to deliver differentiated value for our customers and clients and how we will strengthen, broaden and accelerate our path forward through our combination of Express Scripts. Regarding our combination, I'll also provide a brief update on where we stand relative to the state regulatory approval process and our continued progress on integration planning. Finally, I'll share some initial thoughts regarding our expectations for 2019 before turning the call over to Eric who will discuss our third quarter results in more detail. Following Q&A, I'll conclude the call with a few closing remarks. Turning to the third quarter, we once again delivered strong operating results with substantial revenue and earnings growth, strong retention, expansion and addition of new customer and client relationships and continued industry-leading medical cost trend. In the third quarter, our consolidated revenue grew by 9% to $11.5 billion, and our earnings per share increased by 36% to $3.84. We had strong performance across our businesses with Global Health Care delivering sustained strong revenue growth and exceptionally strong earnings growth; Global Supplemental Benefits delivered consistent revenue growth and solid earnings; and Group Disability and Life delivered meaningful earnings expansion, relative to third quarter 2017. Cigna's continued momentum across our portfolio of businesses through the first three quarters of 2018 gives us confidence we will achieve our increased 2018 outlook. Looking more broadly at our performance, the marketplace continues to demand greater value through the right balance of affordability and personalization. At Cigna, we continue to be guided by Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond strategy to deliver differentiated value and invest in ongoing innovation. A demonstration of our success to-date is captured by our industry-leading medical cost trend, our outstanding customer and client retention, continued strong increases in Net Promoter Score results across our businesses, exceptional employee engagement levels and our ongoing commitment to community impact exemplified through our leadership in opioid use reduction and safety as well as overdose prevention. Further and consistent with our strategy, at Cigna we continue to innovate and invest for sustained value creation for the benefit of our customers, clients, partners and communities. We view innovation as a set of capabilities that puts the customer first, recognizes and values the crucial role of our partners, such as our health care professional partners and seeks to apply technologies which when coordinated can truly change lives. Our Diabetes Prevention Program is just one recent example of this. This program in collaboration with Omada Health delivers an expanded suite of personalized digital health tools to help prevent the onset of diabetes, as well as other chronic conditions. Participants in Cigna and Omada pilot programs have achieved improved health, quality-of-life and affordability in part by reaching their weight management targets. As a result, employers realized both improved affordability and coworker productivity. This program is fueled by Cigna Ventures, our corporate venture fund which invests in innovative early-stage companies with the potential to bring improved quality, affordability, choice and simplicity to the market. Key to our sustained success is our number one strategic imperative, which is to be the undisputed partner of choice. The results of our commitment to innovation and investment help us realize this goal. For example, we have focused on building strong collaborative physician partnerships resulting in the independent research firm, Black Book, rating Cigna number one overall for customer experience in its annual survey of physician networks, medical practices and companies providing value-based solutions for physicians. In the Medicare Advantage space, which we continue to view as a very attractive growth opportunity for us, Cigna-HealthSpring was recently recognized for driving differentiated care quality and customer satisfaction, placing it in top three out of ten national competitors in the latest J.D. Power customer satisfaction rankings. And with strong underlying performance in HEDIS clinical quality and CAHPS customer satisfaction measures, our overall corporate Stars rating rose to 4.5 Stars for 2020. In addition, I would remind you that 76% of our Medicare Advantage customers will be in plans of 4 star or higher in 2020. Each of these examples speaks to Cigna's ongoing innovation and investment to deliver differentiated value and to drive sustained growth. Looking ahead, through our combination with Express Scripts, we will accelerate our ability to improve affordability and choice, expand our distribution reach and addressable markets and further strengthen predictability for our customers, clients and partners. Additionally, given the rapidly changing and dynamic marketplace, we will be well positioned strategically aided by outstanding financial flexibility. Relative to strategic flexibility, our open architected model which emphasizes capital-light partnerships and broad choice for customers and clients, strengthens our delivery system relationships, encourages innovation and leverage synergies across our commercial, government, health services and international businesses, all in a capital efficient manner. As a result, Cigna will be even better positioned to deliver differentiated value for our customers, our commercial and health plan clients and governmental agencies. We will also leverage the strength of our combined company to deliver a medical cost trend that is in line with the Consumer Price Index by 2021. A level we believe is sustainable for society. Now I'd like to provide you with some specific regulatory and integration planning updates regarding our pending combination with Express Scripts. In September we secured permanent financing for our combination and the U.S. Department of Justice cleared our transaction. At a state level we continue to make very good progress achieving 23 approvals with six approvals remaining and we continue to expect to close the transaction by the end of the year. Relative to integration, our planning teams continue to work collaboratively and are making strong progress in actively preparing our combined company to deliver on our promises to the marketplace in 2019. Each of our 11 integration streams are on track and our combined team of approximately 1,000 coworkers continues to collaborate and drive our plans forward keeping a keen eye on our customer and the value for our customer and clients. In September, we announced our enterprise leadership team for the combined company. I have tremendous confidence in these highly accomplished leaders who are poised to advance our strategy and service champions for our customers, clients, coworkers and communities. Upon closing, our combined company will operate from a position of considerable strength as we move forward with four well-positioned growth platforms comprising our Commercial, Government, Health Service and International businesses. Turning our attention briefly to our initial outlook for 2019, we expect once again to deliver attractive financial performance and are excited by the opportunities that are in front of us. We expect continued organic growth of revenue, earnings and customers over our increased 2018 outlook driven by our well positioned Commercial, Government and International businesses. As we step into 2019, there are headwinds I'd like to call out. First, we have delivered particularly strong performance this year in our U.S. individual business, with margins in excess of our target levels. In 2019, we expect to achieve margins more in line with our long-term expectations for this business. This represents an approximate $100 million after-tax earnings headwind as we step into 2019. And second, while we have recognized significant favorable prior year development in 2018, for planning purposes and consistent with our past practice, we do not expect this to occur in 2019. We expect to more than offset these two headwinds with a number of tailwinds such as continued growth in our customer base, including Medicare Advantage, further expansion of relationships through our specialty products, and continued growth in our international and group disability life business. We also expect to achieve a step function growth in revenue and earnings through our combination with Express Scripts. As a combined company, we expect to continue to drive strong margins and free cash flows, enabling us to rapidly reduce debt levels and continue reinvesting in capabilities, all while having additional capital available for deployment. All in, we are very well positioned for an attractive 2019 from both a revenue and EPS growth standpoint and remain on track to deliver our 2021 EPS commitment of $20 to $21 per share. Now to summarize a few key points before I turn the call over to Eric, Cigna once again delivered outstanding results in the third quarter with substantial customer, revenue and earnings growth and strong execution across our business segments. Taken together, our continued momentum gives us confidence we will achieve our increased 2018 outlook. Looking ahead to 2019 and beyond, we are well-positioned to continue to deliver attractive financial performance, and this will be further accelerated through our combination with Express Scripts for the benefit of our customers, clients and shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter 2018 results and provide an update to our full year outlook. I will also discuss our capital position and free cash flow generation which remain very strong and will be meaningfully enhanced through our pending combination with Express Scripts. Key financial highlights in the quarter are consolidated revenue growth of 9% to $11.5 billion, consolidated earnings growth of 32% to $945 million, quarterly earnings per share growth of 36% to $3.84, and continued strong free cash flow and financial flexibility. Our results this quarter and year-to-date reflect effective execution of our focused strategy and underscore strong fundamentals across our businesses. Regarding our business segments, I will first comment on Global Health Care. Third quarter operating revenues in Global Health Care grew 12% to $9.1 billion driven by commercial customer growth and expansion of specialty relationships, as well as premium growth reflecting underlying cost trends. We ended third quarter 2018 with 16.3 million global medical customers, an organic increase of 363,000 lives year-to-date led by growth in our Select, Middle Market, and Individual segments. We continue to win in the marketplace, growing in both risk and ASO funding arrangements, as our industry-leading trend results continued to resonate with the market. Third quarter earnings increased 40% to $804 million reflecting growth in medical and specialty customers, continued effective medical cost management, favorability in our U.S. Individual business, and a lower tax rate compared to 2017. Turning to our medical care ratios, our third quarter 2018 Total Commercial medical care ratio, or MCR, of 76.3% reflects ongoing strong performance of our Commercial business which delivers highly customized and fully integrated solutions that enable better management of total medical costs, better than expected results in our U.S. Individual business, and the pricing effect of the resumption of the health insurance tax. Our third quarter 2018 Total Government MCR of 80.7% reflects strong execution in Medicare Advantage. Third quarter 2018 Global Health Care earnings included favorable prior-year reserve development of $19 million after-tax. Moving to operating expenses, for third quarter 2018, our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 23%, which reflects ongoing investments in growth and innovation, continued effective expense management and the impact of the return of the industry tax. Overall, our Global Health Care business delivered very strong results in the third quarter. Turning to our Global Supplemental Benefits business, operating revenues grew 11% to $1.1 billion. Third quarter 2018 earnings were $93 million reflecting continued strong margins and ongoing disciplined operating expense management partially offset by some unfavorable claims experience. For our Group Disability and Life segment, third quarter operating revenues grew to $1.1 billion. Third quarter earnings in our Group business grew 37% to $100 million reflecting continued solid performance in both Disability and Life and a lower tax rate. Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, our third quarter results reflect strength across each of our business segments as we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth. Now I will turn to our outlook for 2018. For full year 2018, we now expect consolidated revenues to grow approximately 8.5% over 2017, an improvement of 50 basis points versus our prior expectations. Our outlook for full year 2018 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $3.49 billion to $3.54 billion, or $14.20 to $14.40 per share. This reflects an increase of $0.50 to $0.60 per share over our previous expectations and represents per share growth of 36% to 38% over 2017. I will now comment on the components of our increased full year 2018 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of $2.97 billion to $3 billion reflecting continued strength in both our Commercial and Government businesses. Key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2018 include the following. Regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect an increase in the range of 400,000 to 500,000 lives over year-end 2017 reflecting the strong growth we have seen across our commercial market segments. Turning to medical costs, for our total U.S. Commercial Employer book of business, we now expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 3% to 4%, an improvement of 50 basis points versus our previous expectations. I would remind you this is the second time this year that we have lowered our already industry-leading medical cost trend outlook for 2018. Now moving to our medical care ratio outlook, for our Total Commercial book of business, we now expect the 2018 MCR to be approximately 77%, an improvement of 50 basis points versus the midpoint of our previous expectations. For our Total Government book of business, we now expect the 2018 MCR to be approximately 82.5%, an improvement of 100 basis points versus the midpoint of our previous expectations. Regarding operating expenses, we now expect our 2018 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be approximately 23%, consistent with the midpoint of our previous range of expectations. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top-line growth and now expect earnings in the range of $400 million to $410 million. Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we now expect full year 2018 earnings in the range of $340 million to $350 million. And regarding our remaining operations, that is other operations and corporate we continue to expect a loss of $220 million for 2018. So all in for full year 2018, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $3.49 billion to $3.54 billion, or $14.20 to $14.40 per share. This represents an increase of $0.50 to $0.60 per share over our previous expectations. This increased outlook reflects consistent ongoing execution of our strategy across our businesses. As David discussed, this is driven by a relentless focus on customer needs and the key levers of affordability and personalization and by our ongoing innovation and investment for sustained future value creation. I'd also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior-year reserve development or any future capital deployment. Now moving to our 2018 capital management position and outlook. Our subsidiaries remain well-capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with a strong return on capital in each of our business segments. In September, we completed our debt offering to finance the proposed combination with Express Scripts resulting in $19.9 billion in net proceeds. Excluding those proceeds, we ended the third quarter of 2018 with parent company cash of $1.3 billion. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash and excluding the debt issuance proceeds, we now expect capital available for deployment to be approximately $3 billion in 2018. As a reminder, in the first quarter of this year we deployed approximately $130 million of parent company cash to repay current maturities of long-term debt and we repurchased 1.3 million shares of stock for approximately $275 million. As previously discussed, we do not expect to conduct additional share repurchases prior to the closing of the Express Scripts transaction. Looking ahead, our pending combination with Express Scripts greatly enhances our strategic and financial strength and flexibility enabling us to accelerate our ongoing investments in market-leading capabilities and to deploy capital to drive additional growth and value creation. Additionally, as David noted, we are making good progress in our planning for the integration with Express Scripts and our work to-date has reinforced our confidence in achieving the targets we have set for the combined company. We are excited by the capabilities our combined company will have to enhance affordability and predictability for our customers and clients and to create differentiated value for our shareholders. As communicated previously, following the closing of the combination with Express Scripts our top capital priority will be to reduce leverage to a debt to capital ratio in the upper 30s within 18 to 24 months. Even during that period, we anticipate having meaningful, additional capital available for ongoing investment and innovation as well as capacity for strategic M&A and/or returning capital to shareholders. Now to recap, our third quarter 2018 consolidated results reflect strength and momentum in our diversified portfolio of global businesses and continued effective execution of our strategy. The strong fundamentals of our business continue to drive these results which reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from each of our business segments, innovative solutions and differentiated capabilities that create value for our customers, clients, health care partners and communities, industry-leading medical cost trends and high clinical quality and continued strong free cash flow. Based on the strength of these results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year 2018 earnings outlook and we are well-positioned to continue to drive innovation, growth and value in 2019. We look forward to accelerating our growth strategy and expanding our capabilities through the Express Scripts combination and delivering on the very attractive financial commitments we have established for the combined company. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Our first question comes from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to ask, at this stage of the year, probably mostly if not all the way through kind of the Commercial selling season, how you guys fared? And if that's sort of embedded in the comments around growing enrollment into 2019, thinking about both Group, ASO, as well as risk on the Commercial side primarily? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Steve, good morning. It's David. So relative to 2018, generally speaking, correct. We are through the 2018 selling season. I would note that one of our critical growth segments, Select, it's busy season until December 31. So there is activity throughout the course of the year, and additionally, obviously we're deep and almost complete through the national account selling season for January 1, 2019. Big picture, we feel great about the results we delivered for 2018. Our results are first driven by outstanding client retention levels, our continued ability to deepen our relationships with our proven specialty services portfolio and then sustain new business wins. And we expect that will continue into 2019 based on what we are seeing more broadly for our portfolio. And we've not seen any major change in trend from what we're realizing in 2018 versus early look to 2019. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. That's helpful. And noticing the results since the deal was announced, obviously really strong numbers from you guys. Solid numbers from Express as well. So I'm curious if you could give us sort of your latest thoughts on where debt to cap ends at the end of the transaction, kind of the cash generation that you're now thinking about post-close relative to your initial expectations. And maybe just as a follow-up to that, how are you all thinking about most recently kind of the use of those proceeds? What I mean by that is the run rate going forward when your cash generation kind of steps up pretty meaningfully. Should we be thinking about buyback over M&A? Or any sort of latest thoughts on where you might look next to grow the business? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Steve, it's Eric. Just a couple of comments. So, overall in terms of at the closing, we expect the debt to cap ratio to be around 50% or a little bit favorable to that, 49%, in terms of point of closing. And consistent with our prior comments, we'd expect to use capital to deleverage the organization over the first 18 to 24 months. Really no change in terms of approach. As you noted, we're delighted with the strength of the Cigna results, and nothing has changed in terms of our thinking as it relates to the Express Scripts results and how we will use the strength of those results in the first couple of years of the transaction. Maybe I'll ask David to comment on just any other broader comments from a strategic deployment over longer term. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Steve, our priorities remain the same relative to capital deployment above and beyond. So to remind you what they are, they' re three : to ensure the business is properly capitalized for both growth in the regulated entities as well as CapEx for ongoing innovation, and we have a strong track record of doing so, pursuing strategic and financially attractive M&A and then returning excess capital to shareholders, historically predominantly through share repurchase. And as Eric noted in his prepared remarks, additionally I would just highlight the fact that we are well-positioned for 2019 and 2020 during that rapid debt pay down to be able to achieve the debt pay down, as well as serve the business needs and have additional capital available for deployment and then to the tone of your question, a significant step up in 2021 of free cash flow which is just a tremendous shareholder value creation accelerant for us. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Tanal. Our next question comes from Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks for the call, and congrats on the quarter. So I wanted to ask \u2013 Express last week put out a new benefit design for one of their coalitions that featured a lot of transparency, paper performance. Sounds like something that aligns well with Cigna customer base. Just curious on your thoughts on that? And how you think about the opportunity of that product going forward? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Zack, good morning. It's David. Express has a very good track record of ongoing innovation. And I think you should look at that as an indication of evolving capabilities based upon current and projected market needs and indicative of what we'll be doing more together because the notion of transparency, value-based performance, aligned incentives and then further integration of programs that leverage the whole person through the pharmacy, behavioral, clinical programs. But I think it's an exciting step forward and indicative of a really powerful set of capabilities that Express has on a standalone basis that'll just be further augmented when we're together to drive further transparency, further value-based relationships and targeted integration. Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got you. Thank you. And just quickly on your Stars improvement, what do you think about the main factors that were driving that improvement and I guess how do you think about the opportunity to continue to improve those ratings going forward? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: So, Zack, thanks. First, we're really pleased, well-positioned for 2019. With the Stars positioning well in excess of 70%, step up further in 2020 to 76%, four-plus. The corporate rating at 4.5 Stars is critical for 2020 as you know that represents a Stars rating that will be used for new market openings and we have a great opportunity from that standpoint. There's not one driver that I would point to, as I noted in my prepared remarks, there's really strong balance performance both in the clinical quality performance, as well as the customer satisfaction and service quality. I think if you were to intersect the two, our sustained execution coupled with our deep partnership relationship with healthcare professionals is helping to demonstrate just sustained delivery as well as continued improvement and we couldn't be more excited about our 2019 and 2020 positioning. Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks for the questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Sopcak. Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Hi, everybody. First question about the reduction in the expectation around cost trend and obviously that has some implications for the MLR guidance as well. You already, as you mentioned, have one of the \u2013 have the lowest expectation around cost trimming and reducing, and again, what did you see in the last quarter or so that brings you to a reduction? Is there any particular buckets that you're seeing any outperformance in? Is it market or is it your initiatives that you think are driving this? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Hey. It's Eric. Our trend results, I would say at a macro level reflect the power of the integrated model and the effectiveness we have of aligning incentives across our clients, our customers and healthcare professionals and that's been consistent for some time. I would remind you that we've got 85% of our U.S. commercial customers are in self-funded arrangements, so this cost trend really directly benefits them and ultimately, it's their dollars that we're able to manage well for them. Relative to the specific categories, I'd note each of inpatient, outpatient, professional, pharmacy, each one of those are lining up to be somewhere in the, I'll say the 2% to 4% range this year, so each one of those categories in that range. It's not one category I'd call out as particularly changed or driving the results, but overall the total package and the total strength of our offerings bring it back to that 3% to 4% trend result that we talked about and just continued strong execution there. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. I know in the prepared remarks, I think in terms of talking about tailwinds, you said that you expect to see growth in the MA next year. CMS has come out and said that they thought the overall market might grow as much as 11.5%. Is there any way to sort of bracket \u2013 do you think you'll grow it more in line with the market whether you think it's 11.5% or not? Or should we see acceleration in the performance I guess next year? Can you put any brackets around that? And I guess also part of that is I'm surprised when you talk about the tailwinds for next year, the HIF is particularly in MA, but maybe also in timing \u2013 the HIF moratorium. I would have thought that was a tailwind. Do you not think that's a tailwind? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: A.J., good morning. It's David. So two questions. Let me take the second question first. A small tailwind is the way we look at it relative to the book of business, order of magnitude about $50 million for the enterprise on an after-tax basis. And as you know, our \u2013 the impact of the HIF to our portfolio versus some of our peers based on the mix of our business is different. Specific to MA, we're excited about the outlook for 2019. I would remind you that our strategic goal for MA is to grow that book of business in the high-single digit revenue range. I'll also remind you is that we compete and deliver significant value in the individual MA marketplace, not in the group MA marketplace. So we're very excited about the growth opportunities. We look forward for 2019. And as I noted to a prior question, we're really well-positioned for 2020 as well with a further step up in Stars from our current point of strength of about 72% to 76% and a corporate Star rating of 4.5 Stars for new market on trade. So very attractive positioning for 2019 and 2020, and our team is excited about that. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rice. Your next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Just wanted to get a sense from you how your customers and brokers are thinking about the combination with Express. Are you getting any early feedback about whether the value proposition that you guys articulated to the Street is starting to resonate at all with the customer base? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Kevin, good morning. It's David. Obviously the marketplace will always be in a wait-and-see mode, but the tone I would give you relative to our clients and our broker relationships is indeed a positive one. So it's off a base in an environment where, as Eric referenced, we have a sustained track record of delivering market-leading medical cost trend. Pharmacy is a contributing factor to that, as he just referenced. In 2018, all of our cost categories are in the 2% to 4% range, including Pharmacy. The marketplace sees this combination positively because of the ability for us to further strengthen that value proposition for the benefits of \u2013 in that case, our integrated proposition for our clients and customers is very positive. For example, tapping into Express's market-leading and differentiated specialty capabilities is an outstanding opportunity, high value to our clients and customers, and I might add, high value to our collaborative accountable care relationships. So we're excited to step into 2019 with the expanded capabilities, and our clients are optimistic that they'll see a further step up off the strength they're already realizing today. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. I guess maybe going back to the capital deployment question, is there something I guess structurally \u2013 because obviously this is a huge transaction for you guys \u2013 where you say you would be out of large M&A for a certain period of time before you'd be ready to get in? And how long do you think that it takes to integrate Express before you think about doing the next deal of size? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: So Kevin, it's David. I'm not going to give you a timeframe. I'm not going to give you a date certain in terms of when we will or will not act or transact. The company has a very clear track record of being quite disciplined in terms of being first, an appropriate capital steward, as well as making very deliberate decisions that are on strategy, clear and are financially attractive on a go-forward basis. Over the immediate term, as Eric articulated, our capital priorities are quite clear : ensure our business is positioned for continued growth \u2013 we're very well-positioned from that standpoint \u2013 to aggressively pay down our debt levels in the first 18 to 24 months. Our free cash flows will be well-positioned for that, and we have capacity even within that for further deployment. As we look beyond that window, we're going to have tremendous capital flexibility and the business will be well-positioned to be on our toes obviously from a large scale standpoint as we look forward to further conversations on that matter as we go forward with you. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning. First question is I want to circle back, David, on your 2019 commentary. So you gave us some headwinds on the exchanges in PYD, the tailwind on the HIF kind of outside the norm. And then if we exclude all those, is it reasonable to expect that the company will deliver earnings growth in the 7% to 9% long-term target range that you kind of highlighted at this time last year? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Justin, good morning. We're obviously not providing detailed guidance for 2019. Look forward to doing so, as you know. And what you articulated, that's our strategic goal and our strategic target on average over time, and we have a great track record of delivering that. I think the big picture message I'd ask you to take, and with the summary points you made, is we're delivering an outstanding 2018. Even with the headwinds noted that you can adjust the baseline for, it's an outstanding 2018. We'll carry momentum into 2019 on the core, and we'll have a tremendously accretive result with the Express combination. So I'd suggest stay tuned for more, but we feel really good about our positioning for 2019. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then on the Individual business, I want to make sure I understand the headwind there, so I was hoping you could share a couple things. One, first, I've got your premiums at about $2 billion. Is that correct? And then after the reset that you're talking about here, can you tell us what the target range is for 2019 on margins? If I remember correctly, I think you had said longer-term you expect this to be a mid-single digit pre-tax business. Thanks. Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Kevin, it's Eric \u2013 or Justin, I'm sorry, it's Eric. With respect to the premium level, it's actually a little higher than that, probably closer to $2.5 billion in terms of our total expected premium level for 2018. And you're correct in your recollection with the margin. We've said mid-single digits has been our target for this business over time. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Lake. Your next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question. David Styblo - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. It's Dave Styblo in for Dave Windley. Thanks for the questions. I want to take a look back at your 2021 EPS target of $20 to $21. I'm curious if you have an updated view on that from here? I guess since announcing Express Scripts, you've raised 2018 guidance by over $1.60, so wondering if you see upside to the $21, or alternatively, where would you propose to invest the $1.60 of outperformance over the next three years? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Good morning. It's David. Appreciate your question and appreciate the optimism. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we feel confident and strong relative to the $20 to $21 of EPS. Which when you step back and look at it from a jump-off standpoint, it represents a growth trajectory that's at or above the high end of our commitment of 10% to 13% compounded over a period of time. I'd say stay tuned for more. We recognize the fact that the core Cigna business has tremendous outperformance for this year and we're proud of that. There's not a detailed plan to \"reinvest that number\", and as we go forward we'll look forward to updating our outlook, but for right now the $20 to $21 remains our commitment, our target and we're fully focused on delivering that for 2021. David Styblo - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then the follow-up just on the individual book, can you update us on your 2019 exchange plans? At some point I think during the second quarter you talked about evaluating some of the regulatory changes that were happening and how that might affect your footprint and strategies? Curious what the updated view is for your expansion plans or not in 2019 as well as why mid-single digit margins is the right target there? We're seeing some peers deliver above that seemingly on a sustainable basis so why is mid-single digit versus something like a higher single digit margin not the right level to think about? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: So it's David. Two questions there, first, relative to 2019, we will carry strength out of 2018 as I noted before. We're in six states for 2019. We had evaluated a posture in totality as you noted, we concluded to remain in those six states plus add an additional state that specifically is Arizona. Additionally, our view is that the marketplace for the individual exchange business is more competitive in 2019 than it had been in 2017 or 2018. As you look at the environment, there's more competitors entering the space, hence we will be well-positioned in those seven states but we're actually projecting for a little compression in our overall number of lives that we're serving in 2019 and we're projecting that we will deliver toward the higher end of our strategic range which as Eric articulated is mid-single digit margins. We think that's a responsible margin, a sustainable margin whereby we're giving a great value proposition back to our customers. We're working very closely with our value-based providers in terms of overall clinical quality and having a responsible return from a shareholder perspective. So we think that the mid-single digit margin is a responsible margin, a capital-friendly margin but also a sustainable margin and margins above that are not sustainable. David Styblo - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Windley. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. A question on MA growth, for 2019, just looking at some of the CMS filings, it looks like there's relatively modest county expansion and understand that you guys have gone through some sanctions and other changes, et cetera, but is that really just a function of the model, the deeply-integrated clinic-based model that you guys use for most of your markets in Medicare Advantage just being a little more difficult to grow very, very quickly, right. Is it just you've got to be much more targeted or is it just where we are in time and expect a bigger jumping-off point or bigger expansion in 2020? And then just a follow-up on the cash flow, it looked like there were some timing issues. I was wondering maybe, Eric, you could just lay out any of the puts and takes? Understanding that the full year number is still very strong but third quarter number was a little bit lower than we were looking for. Thanks David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Josh, good morning. It's David. To your point I'll take the first question, I'll ask Eric to take the cash flow question. I think you hit the nail on the head. So I appreciate the way you framed the question. It's more the latter not the former, specifically tremendous focus in that business. You can see the tremendous focus resulting in the outstanding Stars performance as well as public recognition for the performance of that business in the top three of the J.D. Power survey amongst 10 national competitors, so we feel great about that. It was targeted and very disciplined in terms of expansion, in terms of some adjacent counties and one new market for 2019 with a view and a positioning that there will be a larger expansion in 2020. So view it as a discipline, view it as ramping and view it as we love the strength of what we're carrying into this in terms of sustained execution, Stars rating in the existing markets, corporate Stars rating of 4.5 Stars to be able to carry forward, so building momentum going into 2020. Eric, on cash flow? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: The cash flow, Josh, really is just the timing of the receipt of government reimbursements and such. Actually I think this quarter played out the same as the third quarter last year in terms of the overall timing. That payment will be recognized in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, but really nothing else to call out there. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : So a reverse in the fourth quarter, 4Q, will be sort of abnormally high. Is that the way to think about it? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: All else equal and we're not giving the specific guidance on the fourth quarter cash flow. It always ebbs and flows and such there. But all else equal, yes. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Okay. Perfect. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. You may ask your question. Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. So with the DOJ approval of the two deals and the states looking pretty good as well, with Select ending in December 31, can you give us a sense of the timing that you might be phasing in the administrative savings in 2019? And as you're going through the selling season for Select, are you actually positioning this go to market with Express with your pricing and messaging to drive cross-selling right now for 2019? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Ana, good morning. It's David. First, we expect \u2013 to be clear, we expect to plan an attractive close this year. Second, as it relates to the synergy capture for the benefit of the shareholder part of the proportion, as Eric has articulated in the past, that $600 million before tax is planned to be realized over a four year period of time, somewhat ratably. So we would assume, if 2019 is our first year, it's a ratable attribution of that benefit from a shareholder standpoint. As it relates to our go to market proposition, our number one strategic imperative guiding our integration planning is to ensure that both companies remain in position and are on their toes relative to delivering on the 2019 promises and well-positioned for 2020. So you should take that as it's a business as usual intense focus on execution for the benefit of both existing clients and new clients that are being added by both franchises, and as we augment through the year there will be enhancements to the value proposition that will take place on a phased notion. And lastly, I appreciate you asking it through the lens of Select because, per your inference, every day is busy season there. So as we ramp in some of the value creation and value capture for the benefit of clients and customers, we'll be able to represent that in part through that segment on a go forward basis. But January 2019 looks a lot like January 2018 with intense focus on value delivery for client and customers for both companies. Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : And just to follow-up on that, what are your competitors doing, either the nationals or the blues, in terms of their messaging on integrated medical and pharmacy? Is it getting louder? And are they possibly coming in more aggressively with self-insured plus stop loss to compete in Select? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Ana, I think as it relates to the value proposition, clearly that's a question for you to probe competitor by competitor and then submarket by submarket. But more broadly, it is very clear in the marketplace, through whether you look at governmental led pilots through the Medicare lens, whether you look at through the successful value-based care relationships that exists or whether you look at in terms of the evolving demand of employer clients, a more integrated approach which is not a cross sold or a bundled approach, but a more integrated approach that addresses the whole person, understands the need of the whole person and could connect the mind and body, the behavior, the lifestyle, the clinical and partner up with a health care professional. That is a more winning proposition day in, day out that yields a better cost outcome, but it's a better cost outcome from a better quality outcome, so I'd say a more consistent mantra relative to that in the marketplace. As it relates to ASO, there's been a consistent trend for years now as it relates to the marketplace embracing more transparency and demanding more transparency through a variety of lenses, and ASO is a mechanism to do so. And as you know from prior conversations, one of the reasons why we've been so passionate about ASO is transparency presents an opportunity for alignment. Alignment presents an opportunity for speed of shared execution which is what's necessary here. So those trends are consistent, but just to amplify yet again, integration is different than bundling or cross-selling. It's truly integrating around the whole person, the information flows, the incentives, the benefit designs with the clinicians, and we see that continuing to grow. And we're well positioned there. Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Gupte. Your next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup. You may ask your question. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just an update on penetration of the specialty book, I think you mentioned expansion of that this quarter so I was hoping you can give some more details there. And then are there still service lines that you're not in that you could provide additional opportunity or are the offerings largely set across specialty? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Ralph, it's Eric. I'll start on the penetration. The overall \u2013 I think the headlines here are just consistent execution in terms of us continuing to both innovate additional offerings and such within our specialty programs and increase the penetration rate of our specialty programs across all of our segments. And again each market segment has a little different set of needs, and so we have to be focused in how we develop those solutions across the market but again, consistent execution in terms of innovation and then continuing to penetrate the market segments with those. Again, we've had a nice track record of that and continue to have opportunities to progress in that space. David maybe will take the other part of your question. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Ralph, if I heard you correctly, when you said service lines you correlated that back to the specialty programs, so I appreciate that. The way I'd ask you to think about that is, I would not think about it through the lens of three to five product offerings, that chapter is long since gone in the past. We think about it today in the existing Cigna portfolio of 20 to 25 different programs or service offerings that our client management, our clinical staff could offer for a client based upon their unique needs, health burdens, change objectives et cetera, and we would see that as continuing to evolve and expand and further accelerate candidly with the addition of Express Scripts and eviCore to the Cigna portfolio. So we see an evolution through sustained innovation, there's not any one item where we say we're gapped by any stretch of the imagination but you continue to evolve some programs and services and that's in part, as Eric articulated before, how we are able to deliver industry-leading medical cost trends six years in a row now. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up, you announced some management changes including the departure of Chris Hocevar and bringing back Matt Manders, so I was hoping you could talk about the change in structure of the organization kind of past the Express deal? And then in your prepared remarks you mentioned four segments, just hoping you could flesh that out in terms of, is that a reorder or how do we think about that on a go-forward basis? Thanks. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: So Ralph, on the second question first, on the four segments, stay tuned for more, it's not a reorder, it's a positioning of four platforms and the respective capabilities based upon go-to-market, client needs and diversified focus with diversified value propositions. So stay tuned for more as we complete the combination, the way we'll bring forward our reporting visibility and dialogue with you will be centered from that standpoint. As it relates to the leadership team, we're delighted to announce the enterprise leadership team as the inevitable close of the transaction drew closer, the positioning of that leadership team has very focused go-to-market P&L leaders, has a large strategy and solutions organization that services capabilities across all of our operating segments and then has functional leaders in support of the Corporation. We're also delighted to the fact that we're able to, not only previously announce that Tim is staying on with the Corporation but Dr. Miller from Express Scripts is the Chief Clinical Officer for the combined Corporation. And then lastly I would note is, we were able to announce about a week ago Tim's leadership team for his business portfolio which will have tremendous continuity of proven business leaders for the benefit of that business from Everett Neville, to Dave Queller, to Brian who runs a specialty business, to Glen who is the Chief Innovation Officer et cetera, et cetera, so we could not be more excited with the leadership in place at the enterprise level and for the key business units on a go-forward basis. We're ready to close and get on with execution. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. Your next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Two-part question. The first one is kind of a victim of your own success question, and you've covered a little bit of this in terms of the year-to-date outperformance and how that might impact some of the forward guidance you've already given. But the question is, when we think about 2018, your guidance now is 12% to 15% better than the beginning of the year, and it looks like roughly half of that is a little bit of repurchase, the PYD, and then some of this individual market outperformance. And I'm just wondering is there anything else besides just broad outperformance or general outperformance on utilization management and cost trend that you would attribute the other portion of the year-to-date upside to, or something you'd want to call out a little more? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Gary, it's Eric. I think you really hit the headlines there in terms of the things that I would call out. I would just note we've had really strong performance in each one of our business segments, and ahead of expectations in each one of the business segments driven by fundamentally solid execution and better cost management both in terms of medical cost as well as continued disciplined expense management and such. But again, just overall really strong execution. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. And if I could just follow up, we've heard more about at the state level Medicaid plans carving in behavioral. And when we look at your enrollment, you've got 16 million medical, 27 million behavioral. I guess I was under the impression most of your behavioral business was with your commercial customers or other commercial players. Obviously you have a small Medicaid book, so the question is, is this trend towards carve in by the Medicaid HMOs, does that have any measurable impact on your outlook for your behavioral specialty enrollment that resides outside of Cigna? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Gary, good morning. It's David. The simple answer is, we believe yes. The marketplace by the day is seeing that the broader definition of behavioral services in terms of the health and well-being broader definition inclusive of the core in terms of core behavioral health, mental health, substance abuse issues, the demand for those services continues to grow. The proof points relative to societal and individual value creation continues to grow, and then the opportunity to drive targeted integration of clinical programs and outreach programs with individuals along with physicians continues to grow. So I appreciate you calling out the numbers. We have a significantly larger behavioral book than we do medical book, and both through market forces as well as the combination we have with our broader health service platform in the corporation, we see tremendous growth opportunities here over time. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Taylor. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. You may ask your question. Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Oh. Thanks. Good morning, David and Eric. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess over the past few months, it's been fairly obvious that the investor sentiment around the pending Express Scripts merger changed dramatically for the better once the Express Scripts dollar amount of drug rebate retention was disclosed. So it might be a little bit preliminary to ask this question, but I guess I'm just curious if you're at least considering disclosing the overall Cigna Express combined retained drug rebate dollars maybe on a more regular basis going forward once the merger is complete, just given that transparency on this metric seemed to drive better valuations and just investor sentiment? Thanks. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Good morning. It's David. I appreciate your comment. Number one, we always challenge ourselves to relook at disclosures, transparency, et cetera, and we're pleased and proud with the amount of transparency Cigna delivers as part of our ongoing communication with you, our shareholders. Just one item I would point out, specific to the Cigna standalone portfolio of today, as you know, our orientation is a highly integrated orientation. So our clients purchase a package of goods and a package of services and hold us accountable for delivering an integrated outcome that delivers tremendous value to them. And we're able to dynamically manage medical programs, behavioral programs, pharmacy programs, wellness programs, incentive-based behavior modification programs on behalf of our clients and customers. So as we continue to challenge ourselves over time, we find it a little bit more difficult to parse any one subcomponent out because we've truly worked to drive that integrated proposition. Having said that, we always challenge ourselves in terms of how do we get the optimal level of constructive transparency? And as we look into 2019, stay tuned for more. Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our next question comes from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yes. Hi. Good morning. My question is on your target, your pledge to reduce medical trend. I think you said to the general CPI level. So, my question about that is how can you fix to that target when much of that is out of your control because the self-insured employer customers are making the decisions about how to change benefits and maybe which medical management programs to apply and how aggressively? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Matthew, good morning. It's David. First, thanks for bringing attention back to that strategic goal pledge and objective. Number one, as you've seen, we have been successful relentlessly working to reduce the rate of medical cost growth while simultaneously managing and helping to coordinate outstanding clinical quality and service quality results. 2017, our medical cost trend was below 3%. As Eric articulated, we're in the 3% to 4% medical cost range right now, and we see further opportunity going forward. Secondly, as noted in my prepared remarks, we believe that that is a society sustainable level and we need to work every angle to be able to achieve that with the appropriate clinical quality and service quality. Lastly, to your point, but taking a little different angle with commercial clients, working hand-in-glove on a consultative basis with commercial clients is how it's achieved. How we've achieved what we've delivered to-date is not by delivering a product and hoping for the best. It's working client-by-client, hand-in-glove, trying to get the benefit design, the network design, the clinical programs, the incentive design, the engagement programs designed properly for those clients and dynamically managing them in the year, and then augmenting that with the same approach relative to the collaborative value-based physician relationships. And given our progress to-date, we believe that that is the right strategic objective to have for ourselves to push us to drive continued innovation, and we think it's the right objective to have societally. Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Just one follow-up, if I could. There's obviously a lot of validation for your capabilities from your customer base in the response. But if we look to some competitors that maybe don't agree with your claim to have the industry best trend, is there any independent validation, since a lot of that's in the self-insured bucket that we can point to on that front? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Matthew, it's David. Appreciate the tone of caution. We recognize that we operate in a competitive environment. I'll give you three items to consider. One, six years in a row of sustained delivery of the lowest medical cost trend; two, it's augmented with outstanding client retention levels. Remember, 85% of our clients are ASO. They see their medical cost trend every month. Candidly, the largest ones will see it weekly in terms of what plays through. And our ability to work arm-in-arm, shoulder-to-shoulder to deliver this result is what demonstrates that. When you step back and think it through from that standpoint, the sustained results we've been able to deliver in our guarantee cost business, albeit smaller, whether it's employer or individual base also reinforces that. And then lastly, just tactically coming back to, as Eric articulated in his prepared remarks, in the seniors business, we were able to systematically further improve our medical cost, our MLR this year, in large part driven by cost discipline \u2013 medical cost discipline but it's augmented with outstanding clinical and service quality. So we like our track record. We like the consistency results and our ASO clients are the direct beneficiaries day-in, day-out of that. Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Our next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. So I'm going to stick on commercial cost trends here, and I appreciate given Cigna's mix why you're reporting a blended ASO and risk book. I think the challenge is Cigna's only large insurer not to break out commercial risk cost trend alone. So maybe can you help us understand what the difference is in cost trends from accounts that you've held for a long time versus the first year or two, and the order of magnitude of difference that you could experience between cost trends on a risk versus an ASO book? Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.: Sarah, it's Eric. So as you think about the ASO versus insured book of business, we really tend to manage our medical cost the same across each one of those things. And so I wouldn't call out over an extended period of time any difference in terms of the underlying cost trends, in terms of our employers who choose an insured funding arrangements versus our employers who choose a self-funding arrangement. Again, overall, across the entire book of business, I wouldn't call it anything that's meaningfully different there. Our programs are effective in both of those funding arrangements and are attractive and that's why we've been able to grow both of those funding arrangements. In terms of looking at kind of over time or newer clients versus those types of things, you tend to see we build our effectiveness as we deepen our relationship and have additional specialty programs and things along those lines come into play. So as we work through the first couple of years of building relationships with clients, you tend to see our effectiveness pick up, but again, that would probably be the only other dynamic I'd call out in terms of differences in the kind of trend by different slices of the book of business. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Maybe I could look at it another way. You talked earlier about the ASO clients tending to want more transparency and that that could lead to benefit design choices in consumerism. So maybe you could talk about it in that framework of how much potential to lower cost trend there is if your book would behave more like those ASO clients that are enhancing transparency in consumerism? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Sarah, good morning. It's David. I'd ask you to think about in our employer guaranteed cost or in our employer experience rated book of business, we attempt to take the same approach not only as Eric articulated very importantly, from the way we coordinate clinical care access, et cetera, but as well the way we try to seek to influence the benefit design. We're not passive in the risk dialog and active in the ASO dialog. We try to be active in dialog across the board because we want the best sustained value for the employer clients. And I would remind you that historically we've not competed in the legacy smaller employer book of business from a guaranteed cost standpoint, the under 50 or in some states under 100 guaranteed cost. That has not been a backbone for the corporation where you might have more routine product design and rigidity that comes forward. Rather, even in the guaranteed cost standpoint or the experience rated, the employers are multi 100 life employers on average, and hence, we have active engagement from that standpoint. So I'd ask you to take that active dynamic into all the employer engagements, obviously varied employer-by-employer. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. You may ask your question. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter. Just wanted to hear your views on what you think your smaller accounts, your Select accounts, are going to be doing with the changes from the government regarding association health plans and regarding health reimbursement accounts as we get closer to 2020? David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Peter, good morning. It's David. Generally speaking, the small employers we're servicing through our legacy Select segment are employers that have wanted to and therefore see the value from their engagement with us to have a more actively engaged, dynamically managed benefit design, clinical program design, engagement programs, et cetera. Hence, on average they would be less desirous of going into an association health plan and losing control of their benefit design, their incentive design, their communication strategies and the transparency they benefited from. So general direction rule of thumb. HRA expansion, we'll call them the savings based programs, that may create opportunity over time for further expansion in that market as part of the dialog today. And the further enhancements to those programs only slightly will somewhat enhance that value proposition on a go forward basis, but that's a client-by-client call. So I'd ask you to think about the kind of selection bias that exists within our portfolio of an activated employer, embracing transparency, embracing communication, embracing incentive alignment with their employees will lend itself to more active dynamic management on a go forward basis and less attraction to be in a pool where they lose some of that control \u2013 for example, an association health plan. Hope that helps. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Costa. Our final question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. You may ask your question. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah, David, thanks for squeezing me in. And maybe I'll just switch gears a little bit. David, in your prepared comments you talked about these Cigna ventures and this pilot with Omada Health, and it's interesting to hear you along with your peers just talk more about sort of digital capabilities. But I guess my question really is, first, with Omada, like how many employees are actually piloting this for you? And really how much interest are you getting from clients for these type of capabilities? And to that extent, are these capabilities really making much of a differentiation in actual RFP activity and bidding and winning new business? Thanks. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Charles, good morning. It's David. Appreciate you coming back to that. We called out an example in the prepared remarks. So I would ask you to think that there are multiple examples. And similar to a prior question I was asked in terms of the specialty services where I said, don't think about three or four specialty product categories, think about 20 to 25 service programs that we make available to our clients depending on what could deliver the best value for them and getting the right constellation of those. Specific to your comment here, I don't have the front of mind, if you like the number, Will, you can follow up with Will. And he can give you how many are in the Omada pilot at the current course and speed. I could tell you it's growing and there's significant demand from clients. Secondly, that's what drives us to expand, for example, the Cigna ventures program because it could accelerate on a targeted basis some of our innovation. And since we are a partner of choice organization, we are open to partnering and working with others to create accelerated value. In some cases it is a differentiator, so some of these types of services are differentiators as it relates to RFPs and demonstration of not theoretical value creation through digitization or innovation, but tangible value through digitization and innovation on a go-forward basis. And you should expect just to see a more sort of constant drumbeat of sustained innovation, we put the customer front and center, our willingness to partner, smart use of technology and align partnership with clinicians on a go-forward basis. And what we called out today in the prepared remarks is one very powerful example of that. Hope that helps. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Fair. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.: Thank you. So to wrap up our call today, I just want to reiterate some important points. First, Cigna delivered outstanding third quarter financial results, reflecting strong performance across each of our business segments. We generated substantial revenue and earnings growth, strong retention, expansion and addition of new customer relationships and continued industry-leading medical cost trend. Cigna's continued momentum across our portfolio of businesses through the first three quarters of 2018 gives us confidence we will achieve our increased 2018 outlook. At Cigna, we continue to be guided by our go deeper, go local, and go beyond strategy to deliver differentiated value and to invest in ongoing innovation. Looking ahead through our combination with Express Scripts, we will accelerate our ability to further improve affordability and choice, expand our distribution reach and addressable markets and further strengthen predictability for customers, clients and partners. Additionally, given the rapidly changing and dynamic marketplace, we will be well positioned strategically, aided by outstanding financial flexibility. As a result, we will be even better positioned to deliver differentiated value for our customers, our commercial and health plan clients and governmental agencies. Before wrapping up, I want to acknowledge Cigna's more than 45,000 coworkers around the world who have remained focused and who have continued to deliver outstanding results as we have pursued our combination with Express Scripts. We also look forward to welcoming our new colleagues from Express Scripts once we close our transaction, which again, we expect to occur by the end of this year. I thank you for joining our call today and we look forward to our future discussions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's third quarter 2018 results review.

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter queue to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell. William McDowell : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me this morning are; David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics including Cigna's full-year 2018 financial results, as well as our financial outlook for 2019. As noted in our earnings release when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues with are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues respectively is contained in today's earnings release which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled Adjusted Income from Operations and Earnings Per Share on this same basis as our principle measures of financial performance. In our remarks today we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2019 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. First I remind you that we recently announced changes in our segment reporting. These changes were made to align with the company's organizational structure following the completion of the combination with Express Scripts on December 20, 2018. In connection with this change, Cigna's results are now reported through the following five segments; Integrated Medical, Health Services, International Markets, Group Disability and Other, and finally Corporate. As previously disclosed, Cigna has also updated our financial reporting practices as follows : first, we exclude contributions from transitioning clients from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenue, transitioning clients reflect contributions from Anthem and Coventry and their clients. Second, at the segment level, adjusted income from operations is now reported on a pretax basis to better align with corporate and segment management team responsibilities. Third, when Eric discusses our expense ratio, he is referring to our consolidated selling, general and administrative expense ratio, which is calculated by dividing Cigna's total selling, general and administrative expenses excluding special items and expenses from when transitioning clients by Cigna's consolidated adjusted revenues. And fourth, the company's financial statements are now reported on the basis of Article 5 of Regulation S-X which is the general standard for service companies and the basis used by our largest managed care competitors. Previously Cigna's financial statements were reported under Article 7 general used by insurance companies. The reporting updates I have just described enables Cigna to continue to provide high-quality transparent financial reporting to the investment community. In Cigna's earnings release and financial supplement issued this morning, these changes have been applied retrospectively to facilitate comparisons to prior periods and I want to stress that as a result of these segment changes and reclassifications, there is no change to our historically reported consolidated shareholders net income, consolidated adjusted income from operations, earnings per share, shareholders equity or cash flows. Moving to results in the quarter, in the fourth quarter we recorded special items totaling to a charge of $389 million or $1.48 per share primarily to reflect the impact of merger-related transaction costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance including our full year 2019 outlook, we will do so on a basis that reflects on new basis of segment reporting and the addition of financial reporting updates I have described this morning and excludes the impact of any future share repurchases or prior year development of medical costs. Finally, I remind you that Cigna will be hosting our upcoming Investor Day on May 31, in New York City. With that, I will turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks Will. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today. I'll begin my comments with highlight from our exceptional 2018 financial results with Cigna delivering substantial revenue and earnings growth across our businesses. I will also review how our combination with Express Scripts further strengthens the affordability of our programs, expands choice for those who we serve. Then I'll offer initial insights into our exceptional expectations for 2019 before Eric addresses our full-year 2018 financial results and 2019 outlook in more detail. Eric and I will take your questions after which I'll wrap up our call with a few closing comments. Let's dive in to review some of our performance highlights from last year where we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth. Our full-year consolidated adjusted revenue increased by 15% to $48 billion and we reported full-year adjusted income from operations of $3.6 billion or $14.22 per share representing a per share increase of 36%. These results were driven by substantial growth in contributions across each of our businesses including strong retention levels, the continued expansion and deepening of our customer and client relationships, and solid new growth across our portfolio. Cigna also delivered industry-leading medical cost trend for the sixth consecutive year. Our sustained market-leading performance will further be strengthened as we integrate and leverage the core capabilities of Express Scripts. Express Scripts concluded 2018 with continued strong performance and delivered its lowest commercial pharmacy trend on record of 0.4% details of which will be provided next week in our annual Drug Trend Report. Express Scripts also achieved better than 98% client retention for 2019 all while continuing to invest in innovations to benefit customers, patients, clients, as well as healthcare providers. Overall Cigna delivered very strong results in 2018 with growth across our portfolio of businesses. Our continued growth reflects Cigna's proven approach to service integration and how it delivers real value for the benefit of our customers, patient, clients and healthcare provider partners. Our recent report on the value of integration which was externally validated show the clients with Cigna medical, pharmacy, and behavioral benefits reduce annual medical costs by an average of $645 for each person with an identified health improvement opportunity. Savings can increase to nearly $10,000 for individuals with certain chronic conditions. As we look forward, Cigna is evolving our definition and approach to integration, driven by the insights we gain from a deeper understanding of our customers, as well as the broader capabilities from our Express Scripts combination. Our approach to integration focuses on the coordination of services around the individual and their whole person health needs; both body and mind. This approach also further expands choice to accesses available anytime anywhere based on our customer and patient's needs and preferences. To do this we must remove friction and help our customers and patients connect to the services which are best aligned to their health status. In an environment where some are restricting access in order to nearly drive affordability, at Cigna we see an opportunity to further expand customer choice and to make it easier for people to access the health services they need, how and when they need them. This includes accessing care in a doctor's office, an urgent care center, a retail setting or an employer clinic or for more acute needs at a facility-based setting such as a hospital or outpatient service center. Increasingly, at home in a coordinated fashion and through digital platforms that are linked with the healthcare professionals. This choice-based delivery model also allows us to guide our customers and patients toward solutions that help the healthy stay healthy, better predicting address risk factors for the healthy at risk and ensure we deliver affordable high quality healthcare choices for the chronically ill as well as those facing acute conditions. Making it easier for our customers and patients is important, but is also critical for healthcare provider partners. At Cigna, we see our roles being the connective tissue that links customers and patients with the healthcare providers in order to help them improve their health and well-being. We continue to partner align with and enable healthcare providers rather than seeking to own, compete with or disintermediate them. Our combination with Express Scripts strengthens and accelerates our focus on coordinating services around our individual customers and patient needs. One of the steps that is essential for Cigna to unlock additional value for stakeholders is the effective integration and leveraging of Express Scripts' capabilities. Our immediate priority is to ensure we deliver on our commitments to customers, patients and clients in 2019 and our position to do so in 2020. This includes the strong service delivery we were able to create in January 2009 an important implementation period. I couldn\u2019t be more proud and appreciative of our teams' focus, passion, and delivery as we stepped into 2019. As a health service company we see our 74,000 coworkers around the world as the greatest asset we have in carrying out our mission and delivering exceptional value for those we serve. As we move through 2019 and beyond with a focus on improving affordability, expanding choice, and broadening our reach, we have three key areas of focus; first, to optimize the significant medical and pharmacy costs synergy opportunities which will directly benefit our customers, patients, and clients and help to improve affordability; second, to harness the breadth and depth of our combined data to better predict and identify conditions or behaviors and improve connectivity between our customers, patients, and healthcare providers; and third, to leverage new growth opportunities and expand reach across our businesses as we enter new geographies and broaden our solution portfolio. Let me use Accredo as an example of how we will create real value in improving affordability and leveraging data, the first two items I referenced. Accredo, Express Scripts' specialty pharmacy business brings a comprehensive patient-centered care model to improving, prescribing, adherence, and clinical program coordination. Accredo has more than 500 specialty pharmacists and a field force of 550 nurses providing in-home care across the United States. In fact, an Accredo at-home nurse is within just one hour of a home visit for 85% of Americans today. Cigna plans to begin leveraging specialty pharma services from Accredo in 2019 to deliver affordability improvements and better health outcomes for our customers and clients. Considering the specialty pharmacy is the fastest growing cost category in healthcare today, this will create clear and meaningful affordability benefits. Second, when looking at leveraging data, today Accredo and Express Scripts apply advanced informatics to identify patients who are likely to be non-adherent or have demonstrable gaps in care. For example, Bluetooth-enabled health monitoring devices tied to blood glucose monitors or rescue inhalers track patient's health in real-time basis and trigger targeted outreach and support. Moving forward, we will further strengthen and deepen the actionable sites for this type of pharmacy data by connecting with our medical and behavioral data. Additionally, we will share resulting insights with our collaborative accountable care physician partners to further improve their patients health outcomes. Connecting our physician partners with these actionable insights is especially important when supporting people who suffer from chronic conditions. For example, those with chronic conditions are seven times more likely to suffer from depression and as many as six in 10 Americans live with at least one chronic condition, all of which further demonstrate the importance of effectively leveraging medical, pharmacy, and behavioral data to drive better health. Building on the consultative selling success, Cigna and Express Scripts teams, our teams are already on a targeted basis identify and pursuing new enterprise growth opportunities. An example includes expanding PBM services for some health plans that we currently serve through Cigna's payer business. Additionally, we have already engaged in targeted expansion opportunities for Cigna health management capabilities to be offered to Express Scripts health plan clients. Taken as a whole, our integration and value creation initiatives are off to a very strong start and we look forward to discussing this in more depths with you at our Investor Day on May 31. Before I close, let me briefly comment on our 2019 outlook. Our growth [indiscernible] has a proven track record of delivery and provides multiple paths for sustained growth in 2019 and beyond. For 2019 we expect revenue growth, attractive EPS growth, and strong free cash flows, all positioning us to deliver 15% average annual EPS growth over the next three years and enabling us to achieve our $20 to $21 EPS target in 2021. To conclude, our team, strategic framework, along with capital position and significant free cash flow position us to lead in an environment of continuous change, improve affordability, expand choice and enhance predictability for our customers, patients, and clients all while focusing on treating the whole person; both body and mind. We are positioned to continue delivering attractive sustainable growth. We have significant strategic flexibility and financial flexibility and high visibility towards achieving our 2021 EPS target of $20 to $21 per share. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Eric. Eric Palmer : Thanks, David. Good morning everyone. In my remarks today I will review Cigna's 2018 results and provide our outlook for 2019. Key consolidated financial highlights for 2018 include adjusted revenue growth of 15% to $48 billion, earnings growth of 33% to $3.6 billion after-tax, earnings per share growth of 36% to $14.22, and continued strong operating cash flow. These results reflect the underlying strength of our business and provide us with considerable momentum as we drive growth and advance our integration priorities in 2019. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Integrated Medical. 2018 revenues grew 13% to $33 billion, driven by commercial customer growth and expansion of specialty relationships, as well as premium growth reflecting underlying cost trends. We ended 2018 with $17 million global medical customers driven by an organic increase of $584,000 lives led by growth in our select, middle-market and government segments. As we completed our eighth consecutive year of organic medical customer growth, we continue to grow in both risk and ASO funding arrangements with a highly consultative approach that aligns affordable solutions with the needs of our customers and clients. Full-year earnings grew 20% to $3.5 billion on a pretax basis reflecting growth in medical customers and specialty relationships, continued effective medical cost management, and favorability in our U.S. individual business. Turning to medical costs, for our total U.S. commercial book of business full-year medical cost trend for 2018 was 3.6%. We are pleased to have delivered industry-leading medical cost trend results for a sixth consecutive year and we are focused on further expanding our capabilities to improve health outcomes and medical cost performance which drives increased value for customers and clients as they continue to confront challenges with the affordability of healthcare. Our combination with Express Scripts accelerates our ability to create that value enabling us to drive further personalization of services and deeper engagement and collaboration with customers, patients, clients and healthcare professional partners. Our total medical care ratio or MCR of 78.9% for full-year 2018 reflects the continued effectiveness of our medical cost management capabilities in both our commercial and government businesses, favorability in our U.S. individual business, and the pricing effect of the resumption of the health insurance tax. Full-year 2018 Integrated Medical earnings benefitted from $97 million pretax a favorable net prior year reserve development including $8 million of favorable prior year development in the fourth quarter. I would note that Days Claims Payable or DCP was 40.7 at December 31, for the Integrated Medical segment, reflecting an increase of 0.7 days over the prior year and a decline of 2.9 days sequentially due to the normal fourth quarter claim payment seasonality in our STAR+PLUS business and consistent with prior years. Days Claims Payable is generally lower for the Integrated Medical segment than for our previous Global Healthcare segment as a result of the reclassification of International Healthcare Products which had higher than average Days Claims Payable due to longer claim payment cycles. That business transitioned to the International Market segment. Overall, Cigna's Integrated Medical segment delivered very strong financial results in 2018. Turning to our Health Services business, full-year 2018 revenues were $6.6 billion and pretax earnings were $380 million. Results for 2018 reflect solid performance from Cigna's mail order pharmacy operations and support of our integrated value proposition and contributions from Express Scripts business following the close of the combination on December 20. Turning to our International Markets business, our full-year 2018 results reflect continued attractive growth and profitability as revenue grew to $5.4 billion, an increase of 9% and full-year 2018 pretax earnings grew 12% to $735 million, reflecting solid business growth, continued administrative efficiency, and strategic investments for long-term growth. For our Group Disability and Other Operations segment, full-year 2018 revenues were $5.1 billion. Full-year pretax earnings for this segment increased to $529 million with strong performance from our life business offset by unfavorable disability claims. Overall, Cigna delivered strong growth and profitability in 2018 across each of our growth platforms. As I turn to a discussion of our outlook for 2019 and specifically our expectations for continued attractive growth relative to our 2018 performance, I will start by highlighting the headwinds and tailwinds that we've quantified previously. Specifically, the 2018 earnings per share performance should be adjusted for the following three items; a reduction of $0.40 per share of U.S. individual business outperformance, a reduction of $0.30 per share of favorable prior-year reserve development, and finally an increase of $0.20 per share associated with the industry tax, was in place for 2018 but is suspended for 2019. While adjusting for these impacts, Cigna's 2018 earnings per share was $13.72. As we continue to drive strong value for our customers and clients, we step into 2019 with momentum in each of our businesses. We remain intently focused on delivering on our promises to the marketplace of outstanding service delivery and clinical quality, continued innovation, and deepened customer and client relationships, all while we continue to advance our integration priorities. I would remind you that our outlook for 2019 adjusted revenues and adjusted income from operations excludes contributions from transitioning clients. For full-year 2019 we expect consolidated adjusted revenues in the range of $131.5 billion to $133.5 billion. We expect full year 2019 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be $6.2 billion to $6.4 billion or $16 to $16.50 per share. This represents very attractive growth in the range of 17% to 20% over our 2018 baseline. We would expect the cadence of earnings per share in 2019 to be approximately 45% in the first have and 55% in the second half of the year, taking into consideration seasonality patterns within our businesses with our Health Services segment in particular, driving a greater proportion of its earnings in the second half of 2019, as well as continued progress on realization of administrative expense synergies throughout the year. For 2019 we also project an expense ratio in the range of 10% to 10.5%, which reflects ongoing efficiencies and administrative expense synergies in line with our previous estimate of $112 million pretax. I would also note that our outlook includes approximately $200 million pretax of temporarily stranded operating costs associated with Anthem's early termination of pharmacy services. For 2019 we project a consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%. Additionally, our outlook excludes any contribution from future share repurchases as well as prior year reserve development. I'll now discuss our 2019 outlook for the Integrated Medical and Health Services segments. We expect full-year Integrated Medical pretax earnings in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.80 billion. This outlook reflects strength and growth in our businesses driven by continued benefits from organic customer growth, deepening of customer relationships, and effective medical cost management. This outlook also contemplates a return to more normalized margins in our U.S. individual business. Key assumptions reflected in our Integrated Medical earnings outlook for 2019 include the following; regarding Global Medical customers we expect 2019 growth in the range of 300,000 to 400,000 customers, driven by continued strong customer and client retention and new growth in our commercial business, as well as mid-single-digit percentage growth in Medicare advantage enrollments and our outlook for medical customer growth also contemplates an expected enrollment decline in our U.S. individual business of approximately 70,000 customers. Turning to medical costs, for our U.S commercial employer book of business we expect full-year 2019 medical cost trend to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5% with the expected increase over 2018 full-year trend due to expected higher utilization of services as well as continued benefits from our initiatives to improve affordability, including those we are further enabling through the combination with Express Scripts. We expect the 2019 medical care ratio to be in the range of 80.5% to 81.5% reflecting continued strong performance of our commercial and government businesses, the impact of the health insurance tax suspension in 2019, as well as changes in business mix. For our Health Services business we expect full-year 2019 pretax earnings in the range of $5.05 billion to $5.2 billion. For 2019 we expect adjusted pharmacy claims in the range of 1.17 billion to 1.19 billion claims. I would note that this range includes all claim volumes associated with Cigna's mail-order and specialty pharmacy operations in addition to claims associated with the acquired Express Scripts business. Our 2019 guidance range is consistent with Express Scripts previous expectations of 2% to 3% growth in core adjusted pharmacy claims. Our guidance does not include Cigna pharmacy claim volumes we expect to transition from OptumRx and consistent with all of our key performance metrics, this guidance range does not include pharmacy claim volumes associated with transitioning clients. We also expect strong growth in contributions from our International Markets, Group Disability and Other businesses as they continue to deliver more personalized and affordable solutions for the benefit of those we serve. Regarding interest expense, we expect total costs of approximately $1.7 billion pretax in 2019 inclusive of approximately $900 million of incremental interest associated with the financing of the combination with Express Scripts in the Corporate segment. All in, for full-year 2019, we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $6.2 billion to $6.4 billion or $16 to $16.5 per share. This represents 17% to 20% growth over our 2018 baseline. I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of future share repurchases and prior year reserve development. Overall these expected results represent a very attractive outlook aided by strong performance of our diverse and differentiated portfolio of businesses and the highly accretive combination with Express Scripts. These expected results are also consistent with our multiyear growth outlook and position us well to achieve our 2021 earnings per share target of $20 to $21 per share. Now moving to our 2019 capital management position and outlook, our subsidiaries remain well-capitalized and we expect them to continue to drive exceptional free cash flow with strong returns on capital even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. In 2018 we deployed $130 million of parent company cash to repay current maturities of long-term debt. We completed our debt offering to finance the combination with Express Scripts and we repurchased $1.6 million shares of stock for $329 million with the resumption of share repurchase following the close of the combination. We ended 2018 with a debt to capitalization ratio of 50.9%. As previously discussed, our top capital deployment priority is accelerated debt repayment with the objective of returning our debt to capitalization ratio to the upper 30s and debt to EBITDA ration in the mid 2s within the next 18 to 24 months. For 2019 we project capital available for deployment of approximately $6.2 billion. In 2019 we expect to deploy approximately $4.2 billion to debt repayment and approximately $0.8 billion to capital expenditures. As we have communicated previously, while we reduce leverage over the next two years we expect to also have capacity for additional capital deployment which could be allocated toward reinvestment back into our businesses to drive further innovation and growth, strategic M&A on a targeted basis and/or returning capital to shareholders primarily through share repurchase. In January 2019 we repurchased $1.1 million shares for $209 million. Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook remained strong benefiting from a highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and returns on capital. Now to recap, our full-year 2018 consolidated results reflect considerable strength and momentum across our diversified portfolio of global businesses and continued effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals of our business is strong and we have entered 2019 intently focused on delivering on our commitments to the marketplace, while we advance our integration priorities, and are well positioned to achieve the attractive financial targets we've established for 2019 through 2021. We are confident in our ability to achieve our full-year 2019 earnings outlook and have strong visibility into our $20 to $21 earnings per share target for 2021 which represents a 15% average annual growth rate over the next three years. With that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. You may ask your question. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks, good morning. Just hoping you could help with the bridge or the underlying assumptions a bit more within the guidance. I know you mentioned the jumping off point being closer to 1372. I think in the past you talked about sort of high single digit growth in the legacy Cigna business. Even if we use 7% that's kind of 1465 and I think at the time of the deal you said core Express would be mid teens accretive, which I think is at least $2 dollars sort of in incremental and would sort of suggest above the high end of guidance. So just hoping you could maybe help with where that's off or if something has changed from your initial view and just the assumption in underlying core performance between the segments? Thanks. David Michael : It's David, good morning. Let me frame and offer for Eric to add on to my framing. First, big picture for 2019, our outlook is in line with our planned expectations broadly speaking and puts us on the trajectory to deliver on our 2021 commitment of $20 to $21 of EPS. Two, I appreciate you walking through the bridge. You take the core portfolio, the core legacy Cigna portfolio is performing well and will continue to perform well. We step into 2019 with strong performance within Express Scripts from that standpoint, not to grapple with you on the math, but you are about right, it is about $2 going back to the announcement. I would just point you to one additional data point, Eric emphasized and highlighted the fact that within our assumption for 2019 right now is approximately $200 million before tax of temporally stranded overhead tied to the early termination that's temporary. We will eradicate that through three mechanisms; one, execution of EBI which remains on track, but there'll be some temporary dislocation; two, additional leverage from organic growth; and three, the significant capacity leverage that will be created as we utilize Express Scripts for the Cigna volumes over the near term future. So when you pull all that together we are on track both delivering an outstanding result in 2019 of 17% to 20% of EPS growth even including that stranded overhead. Eric, anything I missed? Eric Palmer : I think those are the major headlines David. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. The next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. A.J. Rice: Thanks, and thanks for all the comments around guidance. I guess you guys are the first guys to have a conference call since the HHS release last night, so I'll probably ask you about that since that's a top, the main topic for a lot of us. Can you \u2013 there is a lot of aspects to that. I guess I would just ask you broadly, do you see any particular challenges there, opportunities or what would the key open questions from that proposal be? And then always the question, I know HHS is saying they don't have the regulatory authority to implement anything in the commercial market, but if this goes forward, do you think we'll maintain a 2-Tier system where the Medicare Part D will have its one set, and the commercial market will stay pretty much as it is, any thoughts around those or sense will be helpful? David Cordani : A.J. good morning it\u2019s David. So just appreciate the questions. Stepping back we are 100% committed to providing affordable, high quality health and wellbeing services to our customers, patients and clients in the U.S. and across the globe. A key driving force behind our strategic combination with Express Scripts is to further improve on affordability and we built off our strength with another year of outstanding medical cost trend in the Cigna business portfolio of 3.6% six years in a row and just a phenomenal result in the Express Scripts portfolio at 0.4% pharmacy trend. The headline number one is, the proposed rebate rule will not have a meaningful impact on our growth or earnings trajectory. Specifically, as you noted, the proposed rule as will be evaluated over the next 60 days applies to Medicare Advantage and PDP. The mechanisms that exist in terms of the way rates are built up for Medicare Advantage as well as PDP largely by design, flow and respect, the rebates and pass through the way the rates are billed. So we don't see a major implication [ph] to that business portfolio. And then inferred in your comment, it does not apply to the commercial marketplace. We do see some opportunities in the proposed rule as articulated. For example, it provides a mechanism to even further accelerate value based care programs with the pharmaceutical manufacturers. You'll recall from the day we announced our proposed combination on March 8th we talked about that as an important initiative that we passionately believe in. This will provide some further accelerant to that, as well as potentially open up some additional chassis to work with pharmaceutical manufacturers to get better alignment. But big picture, we do not see it having a material effect on the business portfolios configured and are on track to deliver the 17% to 20% EPS growth in 2019. A.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rice. The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks good morning. First one is just a clarification, are you guys saying that Express is indeed $2 accretive in 2019 as part of the guidance and then the rest is legacy core with the $200 million of stranded? And then my real question is, just the combined company and sort of when do you come to market with that pitch? And I know you guys have been laying the foundation for that integrated approach, but when does sort of that broker/consultants education begin, when does the large employer group starting to hear that and when do you think that actually starts resonating, how do we start thinking about changes in direction around membership growth especially on the on the U.S. commercial side? Eric Palmer : Hey Josh, it\u2019s Eric, I'll take the first part of the question. I think to the nearest dollar, $2 is probably the right number that\u2019s actually a little bit less than that, so we think of it in the $1.50 to $2 range in terms of the accretion from the Express Scripts acquisition for next year. David I'll let you take the other portion of the question. David Cordani : Josh, first specific to the go-to-market proposition, important to note that each portfolio and each platform is performing well and growing well. We're delighted that we're able to step into 2019 with very strong growth within the ESI portfolio and another year of strong organic growth within the Cigna portfolio. Additionally, important to highlight as it relates to growth as we look even to 2020 within our organization growth starts with outstanding retention, deepening of relationships in addition of new business relationships. Within the Express Scripts portfolio they'll be a lower percentage of their business that's out the bid for 2020 than was for 2019 and you recall a phenomenal retention result for 2019. Think about that as about 30% less business out today for 2020 versus 2019. The early look in that has the health plan part of the portfolio which is the earlier part of the portfolio, that is up for renewal in terms of the decision making process and we're pretty well through that process with all of them clients thus far making decisions renewing and no known losses from that standpoint, so strong platform. We'll step forward through 2019 and 2020 with evolve value propositions to answer the core of your question. Interactions are starting to take place with the broker and consulting community and that will happen in a phased mechanism. There will not be a singular new product offering that is pushed on the market, rather additional capabilities that will offer more choice, both through the legacy of the Cigna distribution model, as well as through the Express Script distribution model, so strong foundation an early look at outstanding retention, stepping into 2020 within the Express portfolio already today and then emerging momentum around expanding choice as we sit here in 2019 with building momentum to 2020. Josh Raskin : Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Raskin. The next question comes from Gary Taylor with J.P. Morgan. You may ask your question. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. I just had a question around the new Healthcare Services segment, the guidance of $5.05 billion to $5.2 billion, can you tell us what growth that would represent year-over-year, what legacy Cigna PBM plus Express would represent essentially because might sort of back of the envelope looks like that would be flat to down slightly, but there is obviously some disclosure we don't quite have? Eric Palmer : It\u2019s Eric. A number of moving pieces in there, so probably not constructive to walk through all of the different kind of ins and outs and dynamics there. Fundamentally, we've got growth reflected in terms of the operations that make up the Health Services segment as well as the Integrated Medical segments there is good growth in both, but really not able to kind of pull the pieces apart on the call today. David Cordani : And Gary, it\u2019s David. I just want to add on and maybe we'll ask Will and team to followup with you afterward. As the new business segments are configured you may recall and I know it's all net new is, a portion of the Cigna pharmacy business for example has moved into the Health Service business, the mail order aspect et cetera, however the integrated aspects of the pharmacy business remain in the Integrated Health portfolio. So we could take that offline with you and follow up to walk through the pieces, but at the end of the day there's solid organic growth in both of those portfolios driven by our retention and expansion relationships and the net new business adds. Gary Taylor : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Taylor. The next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to clean up the $200 million commentary and then I had a question. So to be perfectly clear, you're saying that 2019 is carrying this overhead reduction of this $200 million. Is that the total number of lost overhead contribution from Anthem or is there going to be more in 2020? Eric Palmer : Justin it's Eric. So I think of the $200 million as the amount stranded in 2019 associated with the transitional time at about $0.40 earnings per share. Ultimately, as that business transitions we will hit those costs out of the system. We're on track for our $20 to $21 in 2021. The final exact timing will play out in terms of cost coming out this year versus next year as the Anthem works through their transition plan and such. But again, think of that as the amount we've estimated for this year that we will absorb and that will need to come out of the system as we go into 2021. Justin Lake : Okay and to be clear that's a drag on the services business. So even though it might look like there's not much growth there that would be $200 million that you didn't expect to have this year. And is that also a drag versus the accretion number given you probably didn't expect to have that as well because of the timing, should you track those dollars off the accretion that $2 of accretion? Eric Palmer : That's correct on all fronts, So think about that as almost entirely within the Health Services segment and think about that as in the short term a drag on the cost. It is temporary and we still are on track for our long term expectations there. Justin Lake : Okay and then if I could just sneak in my question on rebates, Express historically put out a number of $400 million. I know you don't think it all goes away with commercial and all, but can you give us an update there, worst case scenario, if rebates go away where do you think that would be in any comment, CVS put out some discussion on rebate guarantees being affected by inflation, anything there that you see as a headwind for 2019, those two things would be helpful? Thanks. David Cordani : Justin, it's David, good morning. You\u2019ve effectively put in about four questions. Let me try to wrap a couple of them together. First, specific to the commercial side of the equation as noted previously, the rebate rules articulated and proposed does not affect the commercial market. As you go back, you're correct. Let's go back and use the numbers that we put out. First, for Express Scripts about 95% of all rebates, discounts, et cetera are passed back. Second, per prior conversation about 50% of all clients within Express Scripts opt for today full pass through rebate models. That covers importantly about two-thirds of the volume. So there's a little disproportionality of that. The net of that is we have multiple funding mechanisms already in hand today and align payment models that work for clients across the commercial health plan and government agency sector that work for them and work for us to get levels of alignment and we'll continue to evolve those over time. Specific to the rebate guarantees, you'll note that we did not call that out as a headwind, stepping back our industry broadly speaking has guarantees as a part of it. Whether that's in the formal nature of a guarantee cost offering, a discount guarantee, a rebate guarantee, a trend guarantee or otherwise and both legacy organizations have a great track record of effectively gaining alignment and managing those on a go forward basis. Lastly, I would just add that Express Scripts had some visibility into the decelerating trend environment as such took appropriate actions with their services contracts. So again, we have not called that out as a headwind. Justin Lake : Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Lake. The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. I wanted to go to the cash flow guidance that you guys are providing here. The numbers that you've been giving generally speaking have kind of excluded Anthem as a client, does that $6.2 billion number include any cash flow that you'd be earning from Anthem acquisition clients this year or it is excluding that? And then just trying to think about this number as kind of a base to think about next year, is there anything one-time in this number or is this a good number to think about for 2020 cash flow available for the parent if we just add earnings growth per se to that? Eric Palmer : Kevin its Eric. And so overall think about the $6.2 billion figure that I referenced as all in. So it is comprehensive for the enterprise in terms of capital generated. There will be - the rate and pace of achieving our synergies, the rate and pace of capital investments and the rate and pace of our debt repayment will be the main things that will go into - that come to mind in terms of the kind of the top tier impacts. But we would expect to have in excess of $6 billion for each of the next couple of years available in this framework. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, so even though Anthem goes away, earnings growth kind of makes up for that and the $6 billion a starting point before all the other uses of cash. Eric Palmer : Right, Kevin. Kevin Fischbeck : All right, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. The next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. You may ask your question. Steven Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good morning David and Eric. So I guess from me just another quick question here on the early Anthem PBM transition. I guess other than the stranded cost that you alluded to, I just want to hear your view hopefully confirmatory that there really should not be any other unexpected consequences in 2019 for the remaining PBM business that Cigna-Express related to things like either let's say less purchasing power or lower rebate collections or something like that because of the early Anthem transition. Thanks. David Cordani : Steve, good morning it\u2019s David. No, there will not be any impact. We - from the day of the announcement we excluded transitioning clients from all aspects of how we looked at the combination, the business, the outlook, et cetera, but there are no other impacts that you need to be concerned about. Steven Valiquette : Okay and just a quick MLR question here on the guidance 80.5 to 81 could you just remind us again how that compares year-over-year on an apples-to-apples basis when adjusting for the half to the 78.9% you just posted in 2018, is that essentially flat when you do the adjustment or is it a little higher or a little lower, I just want a little more color there as well. Thanks. Eric Palmer : Yes, Steve it's Eric. So in terms of the moving pieces with the MLR, I think the industry fee suspension, this is the single biggest piece, the other changes I would call out would be more also factors we've already talked about. So industry fee suspension is the single biggest piece. We've talked about the normalization of our individual plans, margin and then the absence of prior year development in our outlook. Those would be the pieces that would account for the movement from this year into our guidance for next year. Steven Valiquette : Got it. Okay, great thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. The next question comes from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Stephen Tanal : Good morning guys. Thanks for the question. Just had two sort of topics I wanted to touch, one is just thinking about the long term earnings growth algorithm or target, the 10% to 13% you guys used to put out there, how are you thinking about that now? And then secondly, just to round out kind of the discussion on the earlier transition of Anthem, I guess could you kind of just give us what the new level of year one accretion assumed in the low and high end of the guidance provided is now? And how comfortable are you that those costs are truly temporary? And I guess just separately, like why was an earlier transition of Anthem business not sort of contemplated in the initial accretion targets provided given the change of control provision in the contract? David Cordani : Steve it\u2019s David. First, relative to your broader or big picture question, first by way of background, we've delivered approximately 15% EPS CAGR since 2009, so take 2009 the initiation of our strategy to 2018, we've been above the high end of the articulated 10% to 13% range. Over the next three years, the next chapter of our strategic horizon, we are on track again to deliver 15% EPS accretion on average over the next three years and we look forward to refreshing our long term outlook as we go forward. So we'll have an excess of a decade of 15% EPS growth out performing our long term targets. As it relates to the latter part of your question, all along we understood that we had transitioning clients and we excluded transitioning clients from our EPS outlook, our accretion outlook, et cetera. No one could predict the rate pace and timing of terminations. The termination is an early termination. It creates a temporary dislocation as Eric articulated of approximately $0.40 of EPS or $200 million before tax. Even with that, we're able to deliver 17% to 20% EPS CAGR year-over-year off of a tremendous base in 2018 and we did anticipate it. Hence EVI initiatives are underway, but we're taking those in a paced fashion and we will deliver on the EVI initiatives as well as tremendous organic growth. So those costs will be eradicated. There was just a temporary dislocation that takes place in 2019 and even with that we're able to deliver the 17% to 20% EPS growth. Stephen Tanal : Thanks and so just with that, I guess it sounds like maybe you're still guiding to double-digit accretion ex the $0.40 or at the midpoint of guidance or any color on that part? David Cordani : The way I would think about it Stephen is, we've discussed before, the core accretion fundamentals of the combination remain intact. Hence, we're on target for about $20 to $21 and the core fundamentals of the Cigna business portfolio remain intact. As Eric referenced in the prior question that was asked, if you take the accretion that would have been inferred and date of announcement of mid teens of about a $1.90 you're back off about $0.40 for the temporary dislocation of overhead and you want to back into a build up you're about right there in 2019 and even with that we're delivering to 17% to 20% EPS growth rate. Thanks. Stephen Tanal : Perfect, thank you. Operator : Thank you Mr. Tanal. The next question comes from Zach Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Zach Sopcak : Hey, thanks for the question. So I want to ask about the other transition with your members shifting from OptumRx. Two questions, one is there - how straightforward of a transition is that and is there anything in that process that you're concerned about in terms of the member experience? And two, like I understand it's not going to impact 2019 earnings, but is it at all a significant contributor to that 15%-ish CAGR to get to your 2021 target range? Thank you. David Cordani : Zach, good morning it's David. So stepping back I'll remind you, today we own and operate our own PBM and successfully done so for many years. We also implemented a successful strategy five, six years ago to break it into modules and to partner with others to perform some of those modules for us, initially Catamaran that transitioned to Optum and it's worked quite well and successfully with Optum as a good constructive partner. Earlier this year we announced an aligned plan and timeframe with Optum in terms of our shared view in terms of an orderly transition that will take place. That positions us in a way to have a very disciplined orderly transition of those services and relationships and there's a good track record of transitioning services to them and transitioning services back to us within their respective modules and that will take place over the next approximate two-year horizon. It will create some significant volume uptake for Express Scripts which is a positive. One way you could think about that is the Cigna volumes on today's basis when internalized within Express Scripts make up order of magnitude $75.00 maybe a little higher 75% of the loss volumes from Anthem. So it is quite significant, but it will take place on a ratable basis over the next couple of years. And again, we have a successful track record of in a very disciplined basis of transitioning services to and from other providers. I hope that helps. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Sopcak. The next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. You may ask your question. Peter Costa : So along that line David, can you explain, have you accelerated the Optum timing of bringing that business in-house relative to Anthem choosing to go early away from you and when did Anthem notify you of their decision to go early? David Cordani : Yes, good morning. The answer to your question is no. We had a very orderly and disciplined process laid out and we have a very successful and growing captive PBM. We have a very successful strategy approach that we've been executing within the captive PBM and a very strong partnership relationship with Optum around shared value delivery. We laid out in a very orderly timeline that allows for a disciplined two-year transition putting our customers front and center and the coordination services with our physician partners. So that timeline and the strategy around that is commensurate what we believed was appropriate and highly aligned with our service provider partner. Peter Costa : And then when did Anthem notify you of their decision and should I assume that 75% of the $0.40 of stranded overhead goes away with just from Optum coming in-house? David Cordani : I'm not going to get into dates and timing. I think Peter, to the second part of your statement a way to think about the overhead that we articulated before, there are three mechanisms to dispatch of that and it will be removed. First and foremost a very disciplined EVI plan that was laid out and is being executed on an orderly basis; two, good organic growth and then we start 2019 with good organic growth in the Express Scripts portfolio; and third, the very disciplined leverage of the Cigna volumes within the portfolio. All of that will contribute to and the EVI program was put in place to actually take out the cost structure, so we see some additive opportunities as we look to the future from the sustained organic growth and the leverage of the Cigna capabilities. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Costa. The next question comes from David McDonald with SunTrust. You may ask your question. David McDonald : Yes, good morning. David, just one quick question, you now have a meaningfully scaled mail order business. I was wondering if there is an opportunity to potentially sell additional products or services through that channel over time, and now that you have deepened the combination of pharmacy and medical, is there also an opportunity to expand and further leverage some of the incremental clinical horsepower Express brings, things like Evercore therapeutic resource centers, et cetera? David Cordani : David, good morning. So to your first question, I appreciate it tremendously and Express Scripts is built in has a proven track record of having a pretty phenomenal mail order fulfillment capability, so it's a service capability that\u2019s aided by quite innovative technologies, patents, et cetera. And we will on a disciplined fashion continue to look at how that core capability that you come back to, potentially could be used and leveraged for other services that benefit customers, patients or clients on a go forward basis and I appreciate the call out. Specific to the clinical integration and clinical leverage, absolutely, absolutely. A core part of what both organizations got excited about from early conversations was the shared leverage. I articulated in the prepared remarks a little bit between leverage around the Accredo capabilities relative to the deep clinical excellence they have coupled with the Home Health coordination services that exist and bringing some of that together. Secondly, from a data set standpoint, the ability to enrich insights for practicing clinicians to more comprehensively understand the life or health needs of patients, and as you articulate within the core Evercore capabilities, there are tremendous opportunities where we are on a focus basis already working through additional step function improvements in the clinical capabilities of the combined Corporation which going back to benefiting our customers and clients and further improving affordability and clinical quality. So yes to both points and we couldn't be more excited on the early traction on the second point already. Operator : Thank you, Mr. MacDonald. The next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. You may ask your question. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I had a question just on, I know you are not giving specific earnings guidance anymore for International Group Insurance, so just interested if you can give us maybe some more qualitative or directional commentary on how you're thinking about earnings trends for those two segments in 2019? Eric Palmer : Hey Scott, it's Eric. Thanks for that. A couple of headlines that come to mind for me there, so first of all will continue to have good growth momentum in both businesses. We would expect that we will continue to grow in both and the differentiated return to work platform with regard to the disability business continues to services well and again continues to be a growth chassis for us. In the International Markets business, again continue to grow that platform as well. We closed on November 30, on our acquisition of OnePath Life in New Zealand and this is an example of the continued expansion of the International Markets platform and chassis and so continue to move that forward as well, but overall, really no changes to the underlying growth story and the momentum that we've gotten into those businesses. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fidel. The next question comes from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Matthew Borsch : Maybe just if I can ask a question this way on the rebates relative to the draft rule understanding the commercial payers are not immediately into or not impacted by this rule, but if so, so if rebates were to disappear entirely in theory what would be the earnings impact at this point for commercial as well? David Cordani : Hi, good morning, it is David. We don't have a theoretical EPS answer to the theoretical action you articulate. Stepping back in an attempt to be helpful again about 95% of all discounts and rebates within the Express Scripts portfolio pass-through and shared about 50% of all clients opt for today full pass-through rebate relationships and that equates to - because of the scale of those clients it equates about two-thirds of the volumes and previously indicated Express Scripts retains about $400 million, that's a before tax number. I would add the reason why I think your question is unanswerable is the model continues to evolve. So the evolution of value based contracts and our share direction in terms of continuing to move toward and more comprehensively toward total cost, total value relationships with our clients, whether they are commercial clients, health plan clients or governmental agencies, is the direction that Express Scripts was on. It's the direction of the Cigna, has been on and it's the direction that the combined corporation goes forward on. So those tools and levers continue to evolve and you will see us continue to move away from trying to perceive maximize a single lever as opposed to maximize the overall value which is total cost and total qualities go forward. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Borsch. The next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. You may ask your question. Charles Rhyee : Yes, hey thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask, you obviously reaffirmed the 2021 target of $20 to $21 a share, I just wanted to put that into context with your previously kind of guided synergy target about $600 million. And then if we think about now with the transitioning of Anthem a little bit early, when we think about that number 2021 in relation to the guidance and then you obviously outlined some sort of growth opportunities and optimizing the medical and pharmacy side of it. What pieces contribute that trajectory towards a 2021? And I guess what I'm really asking is, can you start to kind of quantify for us a little bit, sort of sizing what you think these other opportunities are in relation to the 600 because if I recall correctly that $600 million was largely an overhead kind of a synergy target. Thanks. Eric Palmer : Charles it\u2019s Eric. I'll start with a couple of the pieces and maybe ask David to give some more overall color and commentary. So at a Macro level we continue to be on track with the synergies as assumed and as we discussed back in 2018 and as we disclosed in last quarter last year, the synergies that we put out and that were quantified there, primarily reflect the administrative costs and we had expected that those would occur over multiple years over the first four years of the transaction. We're generating $112 million of pretax administrative synergies for 2019 and that builds to $600 million in 2022. You're correct that we expect to generate meaningful additional improvements, in the pharmacy and medical costs, through the combination both through the clinical combinations and some of the other items as David discussed today. Those benefits will primarily in order to the benefit of our customers and client. As it is again, in terms of the synergy pieces those are the pieces you should think about and we are on track and consistent with how we teed up the transaction initially. David will give some additional color here. David Cordani : Yes, and so just bridge, when you think about today to 2021 we try to articulate there's three major building blocks to get to the $20 to $21 per share. The underlying base performance of both assets, the synergies that Eric just made reference to and you articulated the $600 million before tax synergies and the impact to the P&L of the de-leveraging which were already on board for the de-leveraging path, that's the basic cross-walk between 2018 and 2021. Additional opportunities above and beyond that which we've said are not built into the accretion model are further leverage and enhancements of the growth chassis of the portfolio as we go forward and identify additional opportunities for growth, whether it's net new growth or further deepening of relationships, anything beyond what the core businesses are performing is excluded from that today as well as potential additional value at a shareholder level versus passing back to the customer and clients from the leverage of Express Scripts for the transition of the Cigna portfolio into the Express Scripts portfolio. So the basic cross-walk is base performance, synergies and de-leveraging to get us from 2018 to 2021. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rhyee. The next question comes from Ana Gupte with SVB Leerink. You may ask your question. Ana Gupte : Hey thanks, good morning. Can I follow up on the \u2013 just the question just now, on the Express synergies more on a near term basis both administrative and medical, can you talk about on the administrative side is there anything you can do to accelerate the schedule you had provided in the S4 or in today's guidance and how much of it is potentially even going to retain your business in the July renewal season or 11/2020 season given Anthem is now talking about $3 billion in savings much sooner, Optum is 250 and 300 and PMPY savings just from Rx? And then to followup on David your commentary around the power of Express and Cigna together, when will we see proof of concept on that combined business as far as medical costs trend or medical loss ratio impact or you know accelerated share gains and growth? David Cordani : Ana, good morning, it\u2019s David. Let me try on the points to be responsive here. Specifically as Eric has articulated a couple times there's a $112 million of synergies show the synergies we signed up for in 2019, so a step towards the $600 million. You'll note we're being very disciplined. We are making sure that the expenses come out in an orderly basis. We may outpace that, but the business plan and the guidance we've articulated doesn't assume that and with that and with the transitioning client impact, et cetera, we're delivering 17% to 20% of EPS growth. Specifically as it relates to the medical and pharmacy cost synergies and value creation, that will unfold throughout 2019 and 2020 and benefit our clients and customers on a client or customer basis depending on the products, programs and services they have. And I would note that we have very good growth and outstanding retention in all of our business portfolios stepping into 2019. We're going to have another good growth year and I articulated an early glimpse to Express Scripts renewals for 2020 which are tracking very, very favorably right now. As it relates to proof of concept, you should not think about Cigna coming back to you with a net new proof of concept of something De novo we are seeking to build that doesn't exist today as a concept to roll out in the marketplace, rather we are systematically further enhancing the value propositions for our commercial clients, for health plan clients, for governmental agency clients and offering more choice which will unfold in 2019 and 2020 with expanded capabilities and further clinical integration and effective use of data. At our Investor Day we will seek to bring some of those to life with both words, examples, and challenge ourselves to give some tangibility even in terms of some of the supporting technologies and workflows, but it is not a net new concept. The capabilities unfold pretty rapidly throughout 2019 and we will expand additional choice for the benefit of clients and customers as we step into 2020. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Gupte. The next question comes from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Frank Morgan : Good morning. Thanks for the color on the Anthem-Optum swap of businesses as 75% of that volume could be recovered. But when I think about it from a profitability standpoint, how should you be thinking about the profitability on the Anthem book loss versus the savings you'll realize by bringing that back in-house? That's number one. And then number two, was just one of the headwinds you're calling up for the year was the outperformance you saw last year in the Integrated Medical segment, I think mainly the individual segment, is there anything specifically that you would like to call out as to why that should revert or it just simply conservatism? Thank you. David Cordani : Good morning, it's David. On your first question I would ask you not to think about the profitability of those two components. Step away from it. We've excluded the transitioning clients from all aspects of our conversation from the day we announced the proposed combination and the earnings impact of that from an EPS standpoint have been excluded. We have in 2019 this temporary dislocation of overhead that from a full transparency basis we will walk through laid out $200 million before tax and that will be removed from the system in a pretty expeditious fashion and we have multiple levers to address that. But I would ask you not to think about profitability of the Cigna portfolio versus the Anthem portfolio because they're not comparables from that standpoint. As it relates to the individual market, you are correct. We articulated in our third quarter call the fact that, we're quite pleased with the performance of the individual portfolio of businesses. We expected to be profitable in 2018, it is. It has outpaced the high end of our strategic margin threshold and for 2019 planning purposes we believe it's prudent when you look at that program and the design of that program to plan for margins that are more in line with our strategic margin trajectory which is somewhere between 4% and 6% before tax and for 2019 and we've planned for it to be at the higher end of the range which we think is a more sustainable indication of what that portfolio programs. There is nothing systematic beyond in terms of dislocation in that marketplace. We just believed it was appropriate to plan for in view that that marketplace runs in a 4% to 6% before tax margin versus a significant margin that was delivered above and beyond that in 2018. Operator : Thank you. Mr. Morgan. The final question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question. David Windley : Hi, thank you. Good morning, thanks for squeezing me in. David, the Disability business has been on a journey to kind of evolve process and bring margins back up to normal levels and then the score calls out some unfavorable claims. Are those things at all related, do any actions need to be taken relative to the unfavorable disability claims? And then one last clarification on the $200 million, if you were as you have said excluding Anthem from all the results, were those $200 million allocated to that exclusion and now they become real or another way to think about it, weren't those $200 million stranded from the very beginning because of the assumption that Anthem would be excluded? Eric Palmer : Yes David, it's Eric. So maybe I'll take second one first on that. Really just thinking about the $200 million just kind of a timing matter right, so the cost that would have been allocated to the contract they would have been gone away for all the reasons David described earlier in the Q&A session here. I'm thinking about it as timing just because of the earlier transition now that those costs won't be able to be allocated to the volumes that would be going away through there, but think about it that way. On a group wise and disability, we've talked in a number of different calls over time about the variability that can happen on any one line quarter by quarter or things along those lines, but we didn\u2019t call out anything particularly, systemic or anything along those lines, but just that we had favorable life insurance experience and a little bit unfavorable disability experience in the quarter here. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Windley. And now we will turn the call back to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : Thank you. To wrap up our call I'd just like to highlight some key points from our discussion. Cigna delivered substantial earnings and revenue growth across our businesses in 2018. We are committed to broadening our approach to integration which focuses on coordination of services around the individual and their whole person health needs both body and mind. This approach also further expands choice, so access is available anytime anywhere based on our customers and patients needs and preferences. We have a well positioned portfolio of businesses with multiple paths for sustained growth in 2019 and beyond. For 2019 we expect revenue growth, attractive EPS growth, and strong free cash flows, which position us to deliver 15% average annual EPS growth over the next three years and put us on target to deliver our $20 to $21 EPS target for 2021. We thank you for joining our call today and we look forward to our future conversations. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna\u2019s fourth quarter 2018 results review.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by for Cigna's First Quarter 2019 Results Review. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell. William McDowell : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me this morning are; David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics including Cigna's first quarter 2019 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2019. As noted in our earnings release when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues which are not determined in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income, and total revenues respectively is contained in today's earnings release which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled Adjusted Income from Operations and Earnings Per Share on this same basis as our principle measures of financial performance. I will remind you that as previously disclosed, we exclude contributions from transitioning clients from adjusted income from operations, and adjusted revenue. In our remarks today we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2019 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the first quarter we recorded special items totaling to a charge of $108 million or $0.28 per share primarily to reflect the impact of integration and transaction related costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Please note that, consistent with best practice when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance including our full year 2019 outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future share repurchases or additional prior year development of medical costs. Finally, I remind you that Cigna will be hosting our upcoming Investor Day on May 31, in New York City. And with that, I'll turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks Will. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call today. Today, I'm going to highlight Cigna's strong financial results in our first quarter as a combined company with Express Scripts driven by growth, innovation and focused execution across our businesses. I\u2019ll then address how Cigna is creating differentiated value in an ever changing landscape as we remain on the path to deliver attractive growth in 2019 and beyond. I'll also update you on how our team is advancing our integration priorities before turning the call over to Eric for a more detailed overview of our financial results. I'll begin with our strong first quarter performance which included exceptional service delivery to our customer's, patients and clients, strong retention levels, expansion and deepening of our customer, patient and client relationships, and innovation and growth across our portfolio of businesses. I'll provide just a few examples of our momentum. In Health Services we added $1.7 million new pharmacy customers since the start of the year. We drove 9% organic medical customer growth in the select segment year-over-year reflecting the value of the differentiated fully integrated solutions we bring to that marketplace. Within our integrated medical business, we further deepened our customer relationships by adding approximately 800,000 behavioral and approximately 600,000 in dental. In addition, Cigna continues to deliver outstanding medical and pharmacy cost trend across our commercial, government and health service businesses. This momentum has helped to fuel a great start to 2019. Cigna's consolidated adjusted revenue was $33.4 billion and we grew after tax earnings by 48% to $1.5 billion. Within our business segments, Integrated Medical delivered a 13% increase in revenue with very strong earnings growth of 16%, and Health Services delivered significant growth in both revenue and earnings. Our other business segments also made solid contributions, as we generated very strong cash flows in the first quarter, while deploying significant capital to both debt repayment and share repurchase. Collectively, our first quarter results demonstrate Cigna's strong performance and momentum and give us confidence we will achieve our increased outlook for revenue, earnings and EPS in 2019. Looking beyond our strong first quarter results, we recognize that our company operates in a dynamic environment and that customers and patients need even greater value from the health care system. As more stakeholders seek to improve sustainability, we continue engaging with our regulatory client provider and community partners. Our goal in doing this is to better identify and implement proven solutions that improve affordability, choice and predictability, all while accelerating innovation. This path to sustainability is strengthened by our combination with Express Scripts leveraging our broad services, depth of informatics and healthcare partnerships all to accelerate innovation and the value for those we serve. Let me provide two recent examples of how Cigna has already leveraged our combination to deliver additional innovations for our customers, patients and clients. The first relates to diabetes. Approximately 24 million Americans are diagnosed with diabetes and about 6 million of them are insulin dependent. To many of these individuals, who struggle to afford their insulin. In fact a recent yield study found that one in four insulin dependent individuals with diabetes cut back on their use of insulin because of cost. We view that as unacceptable and given the importance of the issue, it was when we decided to tackle immediately. We launched our patient assurance program last month, which addresses the need for greater affordability and increases access to insulin for people diabetes. By ensuring our eligible customers pay no more than $25 for a 30 day supply of insulin. This is a major innovation for people with diabetes, some of whom have to pay hundreds of dollars they can't afford for the 30 day supply. Together, we harnessed our combined strength and accelerated the introduction of this new solution for our customers and patients. Our combination created the opportunity for us to deliver this solution to the marketplace faster than either Cigna or Express Scripts could have achieved independently. The second example of how we're innovating revolves around improving today's fragmented health care system, which is too frequently marked by episodic uncoordinated care. To help address this, Express Scripts recently launched Health Connect 360, an outcome based approach to delivering highly personalized clinical support for our clients and patients. The capability comprehensively connects health plans, providers, pharmacists and other clinical partners to ensure each person gets the clinical care support they need when and how they want it. With Health Connect 360, we're able to dramatically expand value based care programs as well benefiting customers, patients, clients and those health care professionals who are creating the most value today. The platform works by integrating otherwise unconnected data to our care insights hub which provides more comprehensive care programs that lead to better health and greater affordability for our patients and clients. The result is personalized and effective coordination without duplication or confusion. We've already rolled out Health Connect 360 in successful pilot programs covering approximately 500,000 customers and patients. We're receiving significant client interest for implementation later this year and into 2020. These examples highlight how Cigna is using the full breadth of our capabilities to address the most pressing challenges in healthcare. Fueled by our clear strategic direction to maximize the value we create for our customers, patients and clients, our highly engaged 74000 co-workers, our four well positioned growth platforms, the breadth and depth of our actionable data and analytics which give us the tools to holistically understand and address our customer patient needs, and our strong cash flow which gives us meaningful financial flexibility and strategic optionality. Relative to Express Scripts integration activities, we're making very good progress. Specifically we're executing well against each of our five integration priorities which include first and foremost, delivering on our commitments to provide outstanding service to our customers, patients and clients in 2019, and as we look to 2020. In the first quarter, our customer net promoter score across our commercial business saw significant improvement year-over-year. In our health service business specifically, we continue to earn the trust of our clients as validated by the outlook introduced this morning for 96% to 98% retention for 2020. The second priority is maintaining high level of talent engagement retention. We are encouraged by our early progress with engagement retention levels which are above our already strong pre combination levels. Third is realizing shareholder synergies from administrative costs and other efficiencies. We are on track with our targets. Fourth, delivering medical and pharmacy cost savings. We are well into our program and we are on track to deliver meaningful savings. And fifth, is keeping our vision top of mind as we collaborate to drive accelerate innovation. All in, we are pleased with our progress to-date and we look forward to providing you with additional insights on our integration progress at our upcoming Investor Day. Now to conclude, Cigna delivered strong first quarter financial results which reflect momentum across our businesses in our first full quarter as a combined company including continued customer, growth and deepening of relationships and health services, as well as integrated medical business and strong medical and pharmacy costs results. In the quarter we generated strong cash flows and deployed significant capital to both debt repayment and share repurchase. Our first quarter results reflect Cigna's strong performance momentum and give us confidence we will achieve our increased outlook for revenue, earnings an EPS in 2019. Looking ahead, I am very confident and excited about our path forward and we remain on track to achieve our 2021 EPS target of $20 to $21 per share. With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric. Eric Palmer : Thanks David. Good morning everyone. In my remarks today, I will review key aspects of Cigna's first quarter results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year. Key consolidated financial highlights for first quarter 2019 include adjusted revenues of $33.4 billion, earnings of $1.5 billion after tax, earnings per share of $3.90 and continued strong operating cash flow. These results reflect the underlying strength of our business and the value we deliver to our customers and clients. Regarding our segments, I\u2019ll our first comment on health services. First quarter revenues were $22.5 billion and pre-tax earnings were $994 million. Results for first quarter reflect organic growth with the addition of 1.7 million pharmacy customers year-to-date and strong volumes with 292 million adjusted pharmacy scripts fulfilled in the quarter and strong performance in specialty pharmacy. Overall, health services delivered good results in the first quarter consistent with our expectations and reflecting continued focused execution and the first full quarter following our combination with Express Scripts. Turning to our Integrated Medical segment, first quarter revenues grew 13% to $9.2 billion driven by customer growth and expansion of specialty relationships, premium growth reflecting underlying cost trends, and the inclusion of the Express Scripts Medicare Part D business. We ended the first quarter with 17 million global medical customers driven by an organic increase of 224,000 lives quarter-over-quarter and 32,000 lives sequentially led by growth in our select and middle market segments. First quarter earnings grew 16% to $1.17 billion reflecting strong medical and specialty contributions and continued effective medical cost management. Turning to our total medical care ratio or MCR, our first quarter MCR of 78.9% reflects continued strong medical cost performance in both our commercial and government businesses and the pricing effect of the suspension of the health insurance tax. First quarter 2019 Integrated Medical earnings benefited from $50 million dollars pre-tax of favorable nets prior year reserve development compared with $51 million pre-tax in the first quarter of 2018. Overall, Cigna's Integrated Medical segment had a very strong start to the year. Turning to our international markets business, revenues increased to $1.4 billion and first quarter earnings were $206 million reflecting business growth partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements and spending to strengthen our capabilities to further long term growth. For our group disability and other operations segment, first quarter revenues were $1.3 billion. First quarter earnings for this segment were $84 million with unfavorable disability claims partially offset by strong performance from our life business. For our corporate segment, the first quarter 2019 loss was $490 million primarily driven by $449 million of interest costs. Overall, Cigna's quarter results reflect strong earnings, revenue and customer growth led by our Health Services and Integrated Medical businesses. I will now discuss our outlook for 2019. As we've completed our first full quarter as a combined organization, we are proud of the focus and results we have delivered for our customers and clients. Looking ahead, we have considerable momentum as we continue to innovate to deliver affordability and predictability for our customers, and clients across our portfolio of businesses. For full year 2019, we now expect consolidated adjusted revenues in the range of $132.5 to $134.5 billion. This represents an increase to our prior outlook of $1 billion reflecting growth in our customers in specialty pharmacy contributions. We now expect full year consolidated adjusted income from operations to be $6.24 billion to $6.4 billion or $16.25 to $16.65 per share. This represents an increase of $0.15 to $0.25 per share over our prior expectations and represents growth in the range of 14% to 17% over 2018. Regarding the cadence of earnings per share this year, we now expect 45% to 46% of our earnings in the first half of the year. This now includes the $50 million of favorable prior year reserve development recognized in the first quarter which is not contemplated in our original outlook. For 2019, we continue to project an expense ratio in the range of 10% to 10.5% which reflects ongoing efficiencies and administrative expense synergies in line with our previous estimate of $112 million pre-tax. I would also note that our full year expense ratio expectation contemplates a higher ratio over the balance of 2019 than the first quarter result due to the timing of planned spending. For 2019, we continue to project a consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%. I'll now discuss our 2019 outlook for the health services and integrated medical segments. For health services business, we continue to expect full year pre-tax earnings in the range of $5.05 billion to $5.2 billion. We continue to expect adjusted pharmacy scripts in the range of 1.17 billion to 1.19 billion scripts. I would note that this range includes all script volumes associated with Cigna's May order and specialty pharmacy operations. In addition to scripts associated with the acquired Express Scripts business. Our 2019 guidance range is consistent with Express Scripts previous expectation of 2% to 3% growth in core adjusted pharmacy scripts. Our guidance does not include Cigna pharmacy script volumes we expect to transition from OptumRx. And consistent with all of our key performance metrics for the segment, this guidance range does not include pharmacy script volumes associated with transitioning clients. We now expect full year Integrated Medical earnings in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. This outlook reflects strength and growth in our businesses driven by continued benefits from organic customer growth, deepening of customer relationships, and strong medical cost performance. Fee assumptions reflected in our Integrated Medical earnings outlook for 2019 include the following; regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect 2019 growth in the range of 300,000 to 400,000 customers. Turning to medical costs, for our U.S. commercial employer book of business, we continue to expect full year 2019 medical cost trend to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. And we continue to expect the 2019 medical care ratio to be in the range of 80.5% to 81.5%. We also expect strong growth and contributions from our international markets, group disability and other businesses as they continue to deliver more personalized and affordable solutions for the benefit of those we serve. All in, for full year 2019, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $6.24 billion to $6.4 billion or $16.25 to $16.65 per share. This represents 14% to 17% growth over 2018. I'd also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of future share repurchases and any additional prior year reserved development. Overall, our updated outlook reflects the strong fundamentals of our four differentiated growth platforms accelerated by our combination with Express Scripts. Our 2019 outlook, is also consistent with our multi-year growth expectations and reinforces our confidence and our ability to achieve our 2021 earnings per share target of $20 to $21 per share. Now moving to our 2019 capital management position and outlook. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and we expect them to continue to drive exceptional free cash flow with strong returns and capital even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. As previously communicated, our top capital deployment priority is accelerating debt repayment with the objective of returning our debt to capitalization ratio to the upper 30s by the end of 2020. Additionally, while we reduce leverage over the next two years, we expect to also have capacity for additional capital deployment. Our capital priorities are as follows; first, continuing to reinvest back into our businesses to drive further innovation and growth. Second, strategic M&A on a targeted basis. And third, returning capital to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase. Consistent with these priorities in the first quarter, we deployed $1.9 billion to repay debt and we repurchased 2.5 million shares of stock for $462 million. Additionally in April of 2019, we repurchased approximately 600,000 for $94 million. Our debt to capitalization ratio was 48.8% as of March 31, down from 50.9% as of December 31 of 2018. For 2019, we continue to project capital available for deployment of approximately $6.2 billion. In the year, we continue to expect to deploy approximately $4.2 billion to debt repayment and approximately $800 million to capital expenditures. Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook remain strong benefiting from our highly efficient service based orientation drive strategic flexibility, strong margins and returns on capital. Now to recap, our first quarter consolidated results reflect focused execution and strong delivery of results across our diversified portfolio of global businesses and give us momentum as we continue throughout the year. The fundamentals of our business are strong and sustainable and we are well-positioned to achieve the attractive financial targets we've established for 2019 to 2021. We are confident in our ability to achieve our full year 2019 earnings outlook and continue to have a good line of sight toward our $20 to $21 earnings per share target for 2021. And with that we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question. Kevin Fischbeck : I just want to get a little bit more color on the drivers behind the guidance range. Because it looks like on the Healthcare Integrated Medical business, you've raised guidance essentially by the favorable development in the quarter. In fact 0 to 50 versus -- 0 to 40 versus, a 50 million favorite development number. Wasn't sure if there's anything else kind of going on underneath that number. And then for the full year though the EPS numbers raised by a little bit more than the favorable development. So just try to understand that -- that's a share repo or are there any other kind of moving parts underneath that? Eric Palmer : On the raise, I think you've got the headlines right there. Raising the Integrated Medical segment by essentially the amount of the prior year development that we have reported in the first quarter at the low end of our range. That translates through into the metrics for the enterprise. Really no other pieces to call noticed earlier in the year but I feel good about our start to the year. In terms of the full year number then it just reflects the strength of the results as well as the updated share count. Operator : Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. A.J. Rice: I just want to ask about Express and how that's transitioning? I guess there are a number of moving parts, as we try to get used to the way you're reporting, you've got the Part D business you moved over, out of the Health Services division and I think last time you talked about 200 million of stranded costs that you were going to absorb over the costs over this year as the transition declines. I think -- can you just makes some -- a little more comments about how that Express legacy business is performing relative to your expectations? How was the EBITDA relative to your internal expectations and then in the press release, you talk about the 96%, 98% retention rate heading into next year. That's obviously a high number. Can you comment on what you're seeing on the selling season and the chance to pick up any new accounts and maybe show growth and covered lives next year? David Cordani : Let me start with just framing how the transition is going and a little color on the marketplace. And then ask Eric to talk a little bit about the specific metrics in the earnings results et cetera. First at the macro level, we're really pleased with the performance. It\u2019s in line with our expectations and it's quite strong. Secondly, as I noted in my prepared comments. We're well into our integration plan and the focus execution within the integration plan. The teams are working well together. Most importantly putting the customer client patience service relationships front and center and ensuring that, there's not only no disruption there's continued elevation in terms of just strong performance there from that standpoint. And then we're quite proud of some of the already targeted innovations we've been able to bring to the marketplace. As relates to kind of hopping over the current results, I'll hand back to Eric in a moment. We're delighted with the be able to talk about another outstanding year of client retention, it's a combination of the commercial and health plan clients, obviously coming to bear with a 96% to 98% retention demonstrating the value proposition is resonating very well in terms of that strong service delivery outstanding clinical performance, medical cost, pharmacy cost performance from that standpoint and then within the background we're winning new business as well. We'll look forward to providing a more comprehensive update on the outlook for 2020 and beyond and Investor Day but retention is strong, new business results are strong, so we're pleased with the traction there. I'll ask Eric to talk a little bit about the puts and takes within the segment redefinition in the performance, but again, it's in line with our expectations we're delighted with that. Eric? Eric Palmer : The major headlines here, the resegmentation impacts we've had a couple of moving pieces when compared to prior Express Scripts dynamics. The headline overall is the result was consistent with our expectations. As you noted, the Part D business is now part of the Integrated Medical segment, the legacy Cigna home delivery operations are part of the Health Services segment as some of the primary moving pieces versus prior period. Additionally, there are minor items as we've just conformed different practices across the organizations and such but again the headlines would be the Health Services business performed right in line with our expectation. And I'd know it actually were particularly pleased with the strength in the Accredo and the specialty businesses overall. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Justin Lake : Just first, wanted to follow up on the A.J\u2019s question on the PBM. Can you give us a little more color on the resegmentation on the PBM side. I mean, its clear you had a great quarter on the - look the year-over-year growth on the integrated medical side was very strong but when I look at the PBM and all I can do is match it up to what Express Scripts did last year but it actually looks like it was probably down year-over-year when I add into Cigna mail order. So I am just wondering if you give us some more color to help us model this thing going forward in terms of what the moving parts are that might have transition back and forth between those two businesses or maybe stated another way, was there actually growth at Express Scripts you know the Health Services business year-over-year? Eric Palmer : We just had to drill on that a little bit further than. We talked about in my prior answer to A.J\u2019s question. The couple biggest items that move this part of resegmentation but it also note there's normal differences in terms of just timing of different generic launches and things along those lines in any one quarter on. Two, from an accounting policies of perspective and such as we've looked at the EVI initiatives that Express Scripts had previously announced. A number of the costs that previously would have been below the line at Express Scripts things were including and just the ongoing operating expenses, so there's a little bit of a difference in terms of the expense level that we\u2019re driving through in the segment metric versus prior Express Scripts items. And there are other kind of minor items in terms of the timing of different expenses and things along those lines. So again, when you pull kind of all of those pieces out and look at the full year guidance, we continue to be on track for a nice growth for that business and again overall consistent with our expectations for the quarter as well. Justin Lake : And then just a quick follow up on a membership line. Your membership was fairly flat year-over-year. I know you're still or I should say sequentially I know you are still expecting year-over-year growth. Can you give us a little color on where that growth is going to come from through the year and specifically on the stop loss side, it was the first quarter that you guys hadn't seen a double-digit stop loss premium growth in the -- my history of covering the company. So I was curious just with everyone talking more about these product, these similar products in terms of stable premium whatever you want to call them. I'm curious if you're seeing the impact of competition there what you're seeing in the market. Thanks. David Cordani : First from a growth standpoint at a macro level, we're really pleased with the growth trajectory we have stepping into 2019 and our ability to increase our revenue outlook by $1 billion here in the first quarter. Stepping back specific to the book of business performance and the core of your question, we elevated the focus on retention as a critical priority in 2018 as we look to 2019, noting the pendency of our combination and we're pleased with the exceptional retention performance we had across the totality of our business, the integrated medical as well as health services as previously discussed. Secondly, further intensified the focus relative to deepening the relationships and I noted in my prepared remarks significant success there in terms of 800,000 additional behavior relationships, 600,000 additional dental relationships in addition to that 1.7 million additional pharmacy relationships. As we look to the remainder 2019, we expect to see strong retention continue, further deepening continue, as well as very importantly additional new medical integrated business, especially in the second half of the year as the underlying strong performance and power of the Select Segment in the middle market business perform throughout the course of the year. So taken as a whole, we're pleased with the start to the result, our intense focus on retention and deepening paid off and we see a good outlook relative to integrated growth. As relates to stop loss, no change in traction or pass. I think we pivoted maybe to a high single-digit number 9% approaching 10% and we just see continued traction. And I would just highlight, it's the integrated nature and coordinated nature of our programs that are resonating. Not having a product or not having our product on the shelf that integrated nature is performing very well and we're excited about the outlook for 2019. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Scott Fidel : I'm just interested if you can update us on how final MA rates came in relative to your expectations and then how you're thinking at this point about the pacing of geographic expansion in MA and 2020 just also in the context of the half returning next year? Eric Palmer : I'll start you on the rates we are estimate is that it'll be about 2.35% for us, which is a results consistent with how we've been thinking about it. We're in the course of finalizing our bids over the next few weeks here and we'll walk through that market-by-market basis as we typically do. Let David comment on the expansion path. David Cordani : Specific to MA, macro we continue to see it as a very attractive growth marketplace. We're pleased to be back in the market growing in 2019 with our very focused local individual HMO portfolio and expect to see growth throughout the course of the year. To the core of your question as we look to 2020 and beyond, we expect to see accelerated growth begin to fuel that by market expansion to your point. We have a meaningful amount of demand for new market expansion with our collaborative partners and that work is well underway. Secondly, continued in-market growth off of our very focused individual HMO portfolio of solutions and third, I'm expanding our portfolio of offerings to individual PPO offerings. So net-net, we're excited about the growth outlook for that portfolio of businesses with or without the half movement on the core fundamentals of our medical cost performance. Our collaborative accountable care relationships having an access to 75% of our lives in four Star Plus programs. Having a corporate star rating of four and a half stars for new market entr\u00e9e and having the signal whitespace as relates to the individual PPO marketplace, we're excited about the growth outlook there. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question. David Styblo : It's David Stybloin for Windley, a couple of questions on the pharmacy side. First, appreciate the color on the retention of 96% to 98% for next year. I'm curious, how much of the book do you know at this point. In other words, can that number rise as we move throughout the years or up, is there upside to that figure. And second of all David, I'm wondering about within the 2020 selling season as you guys are going to market, how you might be describing market messaging in the market how that\u2019s evolved with the addition of Express Scripts? David Cordani : The way I would think about 2020 as it relates to the Health Service business and the client portfolio, essentially think about the health plan portion that portfolios complete. And think about the commercial portion of that portfolios completing. So there could be some variability in the number`. We feel really good about the 96% and 98%, proud of the organization's performance in terms of delivery of our service promise. So I did break the book out through that portfolio. A bit longer conversation than we could have on the phone call relative to the value proposition. But in a nutshell, first and foremost, think about the core aspect of our value proposition and market message as staying intact, which is a very consultative client-oriented approach to putting together the solution suite that best works for our clients, one at a time understanding their culture, their strategy, to help burden their population, their readiness to change and the opportunity for us to drive incentive based programs and collaborative each programs with them. The add to it is further strengthened in a significant way relative to tremendous breath and flexibility of pharmacy solution and market defining solutions as relates to specialty pharmacy from that standpoint. As it relates to the Health Services value proposition, the same core proposition exists, that expanded with a broader set of tools and programs that could be offered to commercial clients as well as health plan clients, who want to broaden services and the rate and pace of that is being ramped up as we go forward. So core same, client focus, value creation engagement-oriented, enhancements on the capabilities as we come forward. But it is one client at a time which we deem to be a very significant strategic advantage as opposed to pushing product that we oriented around designing customized solutions on a modular basis for the benefit of our clients and customers and evolving those over time with them across the portfolio. You can expect to feel more of that at our Investor Day. As we bring it to life, not only in words but with some demonstrations of some of the capabilities behind our programs. David Styblo : And real quick on the disability, can you spike at how much that drag was. I know it's not a huge part of the business but how much that that drag was, And do you really have visibility to that improving or some of that pressure going to persist for the rest of the year? Eric Palmer : On the disability piece, we flagged back at the fourth quarter that there is some pressure on the disability line and favorability in the life insurance business. That continued in January, but actually has normalized in February and March. So, not want to mention here but think of it as small in the context of enterprise certainly. And in February and March we\u2019re back to what we call normal and targeted levels of performance. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question. Josh Raskin : I wanted to get your thoughts on the Medicaid space and sort of as you guys have now created the integrated entity and maybe more specifically, your appetite for operating a bigger size in Medicaid and then maybe an inventory of what capabilities Cigna has today versus ones you think you would need to develop? David Cordani : So first I'm stepping back. As you know, we've continued to prioritize segments outside of traditional Medicaid as our targeted growth segments in the marketplace. You'll also note that one of our inorganic priorities that we have highlighted in the past correlate around state based risk or performance based programs is we believe that we're going to see accelerated innovation at the state level to take portions of the population and look at a highly integrated clinical offerings that are risk based and performance based. We see that as attractive over time. Two is as you reference, within our health service portfolio today, we serve Medicaid providers and we serve them well. In fact, recent meaningful wins in the Medicaid specialty space relative to servicing them from a pharmacy, specialty pharmacy and expanding over time of the Evercore platform of services. And then lastly, in terms of using the best of the both, we see this as a growth opportunity again for the collective franchise over time. Some of the capabilities we have today the point two, to the last part of your question. One, we're quite successful in terms of servicing the dual eligible population today and the core part of the proposition that drives out or our value base highly engaged physician programs that take the whole person orientation and the continuity of care from the physician's office to home healthcare coordination through social services and the like. And we could coordinate through the long term care dimension. We obviously enter that through the Medicare charity today. Secondly he is through a credo as you think about the specialty pharmacy capability for prior conversations are at home fulfillment capability is quite powerful. And we essentially have a new credo clinician within an hour's drive of 85% of all Americans. So the ability to go into the home with expanded services beyond specialty of services is quite important from that standpoint. So those are just illustrations of some of the capabilities we have today. Net-net on a targeted basis we see it as a growth opportunity in both platforms today and over time we see it as a potential additional growth platform as the marketplace evolves. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. You may ask your question. Steven Valiquette : So for the PBM business just want to drill in a little bit deeper on that. Curious if you're able to discuss the trend of moderating generic deflation. How that may be affecting the Express Scripts profitability so far in 2019 particularly in the mail order business. But also maybe just compare and contrast that with how this may be impacting Cigna profitability overall? Thanks. David Cordani : Steven it's David. Just big picture as we've discussed in the past. Looking at the call it the deflationary environment more broadly, relative to pharmacy Express Scripts as early to identify that. And continue to make sure they were evolving the products programs and services with those clients as well as manufacturers and recognition to that to Express Scripts as well as Cigna. We\u2019re early and deeply committed to a low total cost proposition balancing obviously appropriate clinical quality. And so long as you're aligned with your partners, a decelerating environment is actually a net positive across the board although sometimes it may put a little pressure on the traditional measures of revenue for the corporation. So taken as a whole we see that having the broad portfolio of services, the broad portfolio of funding mechanisms and accelerated alignment with both our manufacturing partners as well as our clients via they health client or commercial clients. Is actually a strength to be able to moderate our approach relative to a decelerating or accelerating trend environment. As we focus on delivering a total low cost outcome, that obviously is fueled by tremendous clinical and service quality. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Matt Borsch : Yes, I was hoping that you could, just touch on the integration of Express just in terms of what are the major milestones that you have left. As you work through this year and anything that goes in to next year realizing that, there's also opportunity harvesting on top of that? David Cordani : In my prepared remarks I comment that on the five specific priorities that we have \u2013 we\u2019re clear for our organization as a whole. Within days after our successful closure of the combination and we remain focused on those. So that guide you back in terms of what we're seeking to accomplish. Most importantly sustained outstanding phenomenal service delivery to our clients and customers to ensure that there is no perception or reality of disruption getting in the way of delivering on our promise. And our MPS outlook and our retention outlook reinforced that. Secondly throughout the course of this year and into next year we have milestones internally as we're continuing to step up leverage of the phenomenal Express assets for the benefit of the legacy Cigna clients. Early on specialty assets and that's taking place in line with our targets and expectations throughout the course of this year. And then further leverage of the Express core PBM capability for the benefit of our clients. Prior comments that transition takes place throughout 2019 and into 2020 and will be completed by the end of 2020. So a very planned full and targeted approach relative to that. On a final note something is less talked about our clinical teams are deep at work with our Evercore Partners accelerating, innovation of products programs and services. Now that capability is in-house and there's just tremendous excitement not just for the benefit of our so called integrated portfolio, but for additional products programs and services for our health plan clients and service based commercial clients. So the five priorities remain, we're well on track, leverage of the Express Script specialty and pharmacy capability is well underway, the broader of pharmacy will be completed by the end of 2020, specialty being accelerated right now and Evercore program development well underway. Matt Borsch : Let me just ask one follow up. Is there within all of that, is there a system consolidation or some type of event that you had to pay particular attention to where there might be some operational risk. I mean I know that stuff is near and dear to you? David Cordani : Matthew very important and appreciate it. So stepping back to put in context as you in the marketplace very well know we have a long history of owning operating and innovating are PBM. In terms of the history of Cigna with service partners and modularly successfully managing those service partner relationships over a long period of time while successfully growing our book of business and delivering outstanding results for the benefit of our clients and customers. That same approach is being taken to this integration and coordination activity. Secondly, we're taking a very disciplined and paced and planned full approach to transitioning from some service partners like our great work with Optum today to Express Scripts over a very disciplined timeframe that will last between 2019 and 2020. I'm not a hurried approach. So no there is not one moment in time or one platform transition. It's very orderly and modular in fashion and we'll leverage our proven track record of managing that way for the last half a dozen years. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Stephen Tanal : I guess given the re-segmentation it's making a bit challenging to kind of compare the underlying results but helpful commentary around sort of seems like everything tracking in line with expectations. So I just kind of wanted to better understand a couple of high level points is the deal still expected to be double-digit accretive in year one. And how would you frame the cadence of that accretion clearly express as a different seasonal earnings pattern and your synergy is ramping. So I'm just trying to make sure we understand that dynamic and maybe in the process get your thoughts on the cadence of the medical customer growth over the balance of the year. And the sense as well for why the upper bound of Integrated Medical segment pre-tax earnings guidance did not increase by sort of the full amount of the PPD in the quarter? Eric Palmer : Steve it's Eric, I'll start and then have David add some additional commentary as well so just stepping back. So we talked about when we announced the transaction over a year ago, now our expectation that the combination would be teams accretive in the first full year of operation just to give the color there. Now a lot's happened over the course of the last year plus. We ended up finishing with quite a bit stronger results in 2018 than we anticipated at the time. One, that raise the jump off point. Two, as we've noted in terms of our initial guidance issuance for the year and such in particular, we had some strong performance in our individual book of business that we didn't believe to be sustainable. We're still performing in line with our targets and expectations, but a step down from 2018 into 2019 and so that's a factor as well. When you adjust for those things, Steve broadly the expectations in terms of income being generated from the various components of Express Scripts that most of which are health services business and the pieces in Integrated Medical and such are in line with where we were expected them to be for the year. And so again the acquisition case from that perspective are pulled so again those are the pieces. And then on the last part of your question on the prior year development, really we brought up the bottom end of our range by the amount of the prior year development. Again just note it's early in the year and that's why we have a range in terms of the variability of outcome over the balance of the year. David Cordani : And Steve first and foremost kudos to you to fit, five or six questions into one quite efficient from that standpoint just to recap a couple of pieces. Big picture I think to the core of your question. Our results demonstrate that we're on track to deliver our commitment to $20 to $21 of EPS in 2021. Second, the raise in the first quarter this year early in the year, but the raise has our EPS growth in the mid teens plus for 2019 off as Eric reference and outstanding 2018. And lastly just reinforcing all along the way with tremendous free cash flow production which underlies the kind of quality of the results that we're able to post so we feel great about the results here. Operator : Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup. You may ask your question. Ralph Giacobbe : Just wanted to go to the enrolment figures looks like ASO was flat to slightly down. And I know there's the employer segments that we needed that consider there 49.38 but the risk of this was also up. So anything to kind of call out that's either happening in the market and or so your positioning and then just you mentioned the national account losses maybe any details there. And the opportunity with the larger employer base now with Express. And when you think maybe you could see that perhaps start to show better growth? Thanks. David Cordani : A couple points, first again to set the stage relative to growth. And as indicated previously really pleased with the growth trajectory we're stepping into 2019 with the revenue health the ability to increase our revenue outlook by $1 billion this early in the year we're quite pleased with that. Secondly, we had an intensified focus in 2018 with our eye toward 2019 on retention acknowledging dependency of the transaction and the potential perceived disruption as well as further deepening results. So we look at growth more holistically than a singular measure of medical customer growth although I'll come to that which is a quite important measure. And as noted we grew our specialty license further deepened relationships quite attractively. As it relates to the Integrated Medical customer growth we feel good about our outlook for the full year. As I noted we will expect to see continued strong performance in trajectory of the select in the middle market portfolio throughout the residual part of the year specifically, the second half of the year. July tends to be an important July 1 is an important month for that portfolio September 1 is an important month for that portfolio and that portfolio will perform well. We had a little lighter retention rate in national accounts for 1/1/2019. Last year we had a bit stronger this year we had a little lighter. There's your way of sowing and so within the context of that. But again we further deepened relationships with the specialty portfolio. On a final note as a combined corporation, we'll be looking again more holistically at those larger account relationships deciding whether or not we're best positioned to have an expanded services relationship with those clients and or an integrated relationship or a combination of both. So you'll see again the revenue growth be contributed through both segments not just one segment on a go forward basis again taken as a whole we feel really good about the result for 2019. Operator : Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with SVB Leerink. Your line is open you may ask your question. Ana Gupte : Just following up on Ralph question again exit 9% [indiscernible] is slightly down and needs to be [indiscernible] single. When you look at this again and this is obviously early days for you on Express against your stated goal and can stop because of the overlapping 30% of that is it because there is a convergence of new competitors like perhaps and some or evenly man house in those segments or is it because we don't have exits here that\u2019s the whole broader transition from fully insured self-insured difference [indiscernible]? David Cordani : Ana it's David it was a bit hard to hear you with the background noise but I think I got the core of your question. The simple answer to the last part of your question is, no. We do not see a change in performance relative to the competitive landscape. It has been, is and will continue to be a competitive environment. We need to deliver outstanding value and we need to continue to innovate. Specifically, as I noted in my prepared remarks Select segment had an outstanding performance in the first quarter of this year and we'll have another strong year this year. I remind you that that strike zone is expanded from 50 to 250 to 50 to 500 and we\u2019re successfully selling both our core ASO Stop Loss offering as well as guarantee costs as we offer choice in the marketplace and our full integrated as opposed to a bundled offering but a full integrated offering continues to resonate very well in that portfolio for us as we go forward. Specifically to the larger account portfolio, national either signals definition of that 5000 or more employees commercial and multi-state. It's a smaller strike zone than many of our competitors defined. And we see that as a marketplace that is essentially in an organic basis for the marketplace as a whole not a growth marketplace but one where we selectively seek to differentiate ourselves and deepen our relationships. And then just lastly the services portfolio will enable us to deepen those relationships as we go forward and we see early traction on that right now that we're pleased with. So net-net we're pleased with the result and we're happy with the position we have for 2019 especially the second half integrated offerings that we have in the marketplace. Operator : Our next question comes from Zach Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Zach Sopcak : I want to ask about the diabetes patient Assurance Program. It looks like the savings that the patients are seeing is being funded by the insulin manufacturers. 22,000 models that was translatable to either other disease states or other pharmaceutical categories like a benefit use going forward. And then I know it's early but any early feedback from clients on response the program or uptake which I would expect would be pretty close to a 100%. Thank you. David Cordani : So, as we noted that's an example of the power of the combination and can accelerate innovations that puts the customer front and center or patient and then looks at their specific needs on affordability and predictability. We're able to essentially and we don\u2019t go through all the details. It's about time as well as a competitive differentiator. We're able to rapidly reengineer relationships and alignment very importantly with a pharmaceutical manufacturer partners to again put that customer patient front and center and provide that level of predictability. And we just couldn't be more pleased with that client feedback early on is extremely positive and we would expect adoption of that to ramp pretty meaningfully over time. To the core of your question as well which I appreciate. There is a platform within there for other disease or health burden states that our team is aggressively focused on right now. So exciting opportunities to give more peace of mind, predictability and customer a patient derived view of affordability to the marketplace and we stepped into diabetes and insulin specifically because of the size of the population and the needs set to be able to address this. But that platform could be leveraged further. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is up. You may ask your question. Peter Costa : Related to A.J. and Justin ask, when we see strong retention and new member growth combined with what you know look like margin pressure in the health services area. We worry a little bit about pricing and that combined with the proposed rebate rule in Medicare and maybe potential legislation you know on commercial drug rebates, we worry that could mean spread based pricing - spread based pricing is giving way to transparent pricing in the pharmacy benefit area and that may have narrower margins. So my question is where would you see Health Services margins, if we were to move to fully transparent pricing. And is that where you think we're going here? David Cordani : Let me put this in a couple of blocks. First and foremost, our passionate view is that client retention when you deal with the affordability and the transparency that exists in all of our products and programs today is a direct correlation of the clients view of the value we are delivering to them day-in, day-out. Regrown back to the Health Services portfolio, the commercial pharmacy trend for 2018 was 0.4%, a phenomenal result, not perfection of phenomenal results with strong service delivery and additional proven innovations as we go forward. That's what enables us to deliver that retention. Two, to your margin question, the margin levels are in line with our expectations. This puts and takes they're aligned with our expectations, they're strong, they're shareholder friendly and we need to get the right balance in terms of alignment with our clients, our customers, our patients as well as from a shareholder return but they're aligned with our expectations. There will be puts and takes and levers on a go forward basis and we see more transparency as an opportunity to drive more of alignment. We see alignment as a strategic advantage. It's something we embrace, because alignment allows us to accelerate innovation and that allows us to drive lower total costs and higher total quality and a go forward basis. And we've been able to prove as an organization that delivering that type of value allows you to get a fair sustainable margin and that's what we're on track for. So whether it be spread pricing, a change in posture on rebates or otherwise, those are movements in sub components of the portfolio. The total cost, total value proposition is to work and we've proven the ability to innovate to make sure we're able to get a fair sustainable shareholder return through margin and we're excited about that because we have the ability to lead in that changing marketplace as opposed to resist it. Operator : Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Lance Wilkes : I had a question on the PBM.As you're looking at the new business coming in at 2019 and outlook for 2020 is that new business coming in sort of average margin or does it slope so maybe you're wanted at a lower margin than average and then kind of gets up to a target margin over the life of a contract. And I guess related to that, how are you guys looking at moving to a kind of full risk models or things that will move your guaranteeing total PBM pharmacy costs. Is that something where you're piloting it or is that something that really doesn't have client interests at this point? David Cordani : I appreciate the questions. As you might expect we're not going to tell you what the slope of our pricing curve or approach in the marketplace is, big picture though stepping back, we're pleased with the performance, pleased with the financial results, pleased with the positioning of their client-by-client decisions that are made because everything we do in our company is oriented around one client at a time, strategic alignment and sustained innovation going forward and the coexistence of the new business growth with the outstanding retention and the deepening of the relationships reinforces that. So we're pleased with the positioning and the discipline you would expect us to have from a new business standpoint continues in the organization. As it relates to your second point, there is appetite no doubt for dimensions of or examples of deepening alignment guarantees or otherwise and we have the capabilities within the portfolio to be able to do that. Again that's one client at a time. And it all comes back to alignments with your partner, making sure we put the programs in place financing or otherwise and then we perform and we have a track record and knock on wood of the performance and the alignment, but there's not a one size fits all guarantee program that we're putting in the marketplace, it's a client-by-client side of relationships and again we see that as an advantage for us both in the integrated portfolio as well as in the services portfolio as we go forward. Again something we embrace and we're driving for the change in. Operator : Our last question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. You may ask your question. Charles Rhyee : I just wanted to -- one clarification first and then probably the question on sort of how we think about the cadence here in health services. You know earlier -- I think the question was asked about how do we compare this results to a year ago when you look at the former Express Scripts, is the best way to look at it right now is because I believe last year included Anthem, so the best way to look at it is your existing results before taking out the transitioning clients for compatibility perspective. You know that's for some clarification but then I guess my question though is you talked about $200 million services traded costs. Can you give us a sense on that kind of front end loaded into a year in terms of the impact on our results and should we have that taper off as we go through the rest of the year. And then lastly related to that you know, is there anything else in terms of the cadence in terms of Express we should be thinking about as we model it out. Thank you. Eric Palmer : So a couple of different dimensions to that question there. But the first and foremost year-over-year, I'd encourage you on a particular quarter there. There are a number of different moving pieces, so there wouldn't want you to just one adjustment and then you'd have comparability as I mentioned in my prior answer several different dimensions between resegmentation which is normal, timing quarter-to-quarter types of items in that of the conformance of various policies and that just make quarter-over-quarter difficult. The punch line though on the full year in line with our expectations performing well and we'll expect to deliver growth and touch there. The second part of your question in terms of the $200 million stranded costs that we identified, that's a function of a couple of things. We haven't provided a specific quarter-by-quarter guidance. But think of as the - as the transition in clients as Anthem works through their migration, and the volumes come out. That will increase things but we'll be working to rightsize our expense base so again those will be working to offset each other over the balance of the year. And then last but not least in terms of just the other items in terms of the sequencing of earnings over the year the note in my prepared remarks continue to expect 45% to 46% of the enterprise's income in the first half of the year. Think about across the segments Integrated Medical tends to be more front end loaded so higher income in the beginning part of the year and that tapers down over the year as customers reach their deductibles and things along those lines. Health services business tends to have the other dynamic where the income builds throughout the course of the year and I think you'll see that in the Express Scripts historic result. On top of that this year we've got the additional effect of the synergies will build throughout the course of the year and will have the effect of as we work with the deleveraging interest costs will decline throughout the year. So that probably even further puts the income towards the back half of the year than \u201ca normal year\u201d all to be an equal. Operator : At this time I\u2019ll turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : Thank you. Just wrap up our call. I'd like to highlight some key points from today's discussion. Cigna delivered strong financial results in our first quarter as a combined company with Express Scripts, driven by growth, innovation and focus execution across our businesses relative to our Express Scripts integration activities, we're making very good progress and executing well against each of our five integration priorities. Collectively our first quarter results demonstrate Cigna\u2019s strong performance and momentum and gives us confidence we will achieve our increased outlook for revenue, earnings and EPS in 2019. We remain on track to achieve our 2021 EPA target of $20, $21 per share and we look forward to going into this deeper with you as well as our long term growth strategy at our Investor Day later this month. Thank you for joining our call today. And we look forward to our future discussions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna\u2019s first quarter 2019 results review.

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter queue to ask question at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell. William McDowell : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me this morning are; David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics including Cigna's second quarter 2019 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2019. As noted in our earnings release when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues which are not determined in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income, and total revenues respectively is contained in today's earnings release which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled Adjusted Income from Operations and Earnings Per Share on this same basis as our principle measures of financial performance. I will remind you that as previously disclosed, we exclude contributions from transitioning clients from adjusted income from operations, and adjusted revenue. In our remarks today we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2019 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the second quarter we recorded an after tax special item charge of $115 million or $0.30 per share for integration and transaction related costs. We also recorded a special item charge of $64 million or $0.17 per share, for our litigation matter.  As described in today\u2019s earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations, in our discussion of financial results. Please note that consistent with best practice, when we make prospective comments, regarding financial performance, including our full year 2019 outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future share repurchases or additional prior year development of medical costs.  And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks, Will. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our call. Today I'll highlight Cigna's strong second quarter financial results, which reflect continued momentum across our businesses. I'll also discuss how our differentiated health service model fuels our ability to drive innovation and accelerated growth and build a more sustainable healthcare system. I'll begin with our second quarter performance, which included continued innovation, which drove strong revenue and earnings growth, exceptional service delivery, and deepening of our customer and client relationships. Cigna's consolidated adjusted revenue for the quarter was $34.4 billion, and we grew our earnings to $1.6 billion. Our results [indiscernible] Health Services and Integrated Medical segments, with Health Services delivering strong revenues and earnings that were modestly above our expectations and our Integrated Medical segment delivering a 10% increase in revenues with earnings growth of 8%. In addition, Cigna continue to deliver solid performance across our international markets and other businesses. Overall, we're pleased with our second quarter results, which continue to demonstrate momentum across our portfolio of businesses. We're also making very good progress on our integration priorities. As we continue to provide excellent services across our portfolio of businesses, retain and meaningfully grow our client relationships, deliver leading medical and pharmacy cost trend, drive medical and pharmacy synergies for the direct benefit of our customers and clients and deliver on our synergy capture for the benefit of our shareholders. All in we're on track to achieve our integration goals. Collectively, our second quarter performance gives us confidence to again raise our revenue in earnings outlook for 2019, representing 17% to 19% EPS growth over Cigna's strong 2018 performance. Our strong results and confidence in continued long-term sustainable growth are fueled by the same thing. Our portfolio of leading assets that we connect to provide better care, greater choice, and approved affordability for those we serve. We are led by clear mission and more than 74,000 talented colleagues focused on improving health, well-being and peace of mind for those we serve. Our four growth businesses give us a path for attractive growth in a dynamic marketplace and regulatory environment. In commercial, we are executing our plans to expand our go deep markets by 25% over the next three to five years, building on the success of our proven strategy. In Medicare Advantage we expect 10% to 15% average annual customer growth, driven by both product and geographic market expansion beginning in 2020. In our Health Services business, we see meaningful opportunities for sustained growth through innovative new products, cross selling opportunities, and further geographic expansion, given the modest overlap between our Health Services and Integrated Medical businesses. We also continue to serve commercial clients while we further expand and deepen health plan and governmental agency client relationships. And in international markets, we continue our product and distribution channel expansion to drive sustained attractive growth. By leveraging these distinctive assets, and guided by our clear strategic direction, Cigna is accelerating the future of healthcare.  We began this journey almost a decade ago, when we moved from the transactional phase of healthcare to leading the transitional phase, where we demonstrated that improving health, engaging individuals and supporting and incentivizing healthcare professionals does work and yields real value. That value includes delivering lower medical costs trend fueled in part by our leading portfolio specialty capabilities, which includes behavioral health and coaching programs that serve as the cornerstone of our coordinated care approach. Our approach has earned us a privilege to serve more than 165 million customer relationships around the globe.  Now, our transformative model of healthcare is building on the progress we have made to position us to lead the industry including a better, more sustainable healthcare system. Our focus is in three critical areas, treating the whole person body and mind, targeted rapid innovation to meet customers need for more affordable, personalized solution, and leveraging data and technology to serve as a connective tissue between our customers and their health care professional partners of choice.  Let me briefly touch on these components beginning with the first two, treating the whole person and investing in targeted innovation to meet the needs for more affordable personalized solutions. We see extraordinary opportunities to achieve better whole person health by building personalized solutions at scale in a way nobody else does. As we offer holistic, connected approach to addressing emerging threats to health. For example, it is clear to us that conditions such as stress, loneliness and depression, each impact overall health and vitality, as well as overall cost of care. Often we see people having one or more of these conditions. Further data demonstrates that behavioral and medical conditions are highly interrelated. Having both behavioral and medical conditions can increase cost of care by up to 2 to 3 times, compared with the cost of treating a patient without a behavioral health condition. For example, chronic stress is becoming a major concern around the world. It is linked to reduced workplace productivity, and costs employers hundreds of billions of dollars a year in the United States alone. In most cases, in the United States, and the world for that matter, behavioral and medical services remain uncoordinated. At Cigna, we are addressing these costs and conditions in a better more coordinated way. We have more than 1,000 coaches and specialists helping individuals set goals and improve their behavioral and mental health conditions. We have 600 nurses who visit our customers' homes every day, we have more than 650 aligned collaborative accountable care relationships who are now rapidly expanding services to include behavioral health programs. And we have game changing connected data, thanks to the combination of Cigna and Express Scripts. I'll provide two examples of the benefit of our integrated approach. The first relates to our work to address the mental health needs of first responders. 85% of firefighters, police officers and paramedics and other first responders have experienced symptoms related to mental health issues. However, many have trouble accessing coordinated local care. In a first of its kind initiative, we work closely with the City of San Diego, and local healthcare professionals to give first responders easy, coordinated access to behavioral wellness treatment. We're bringing together our capabilities with data and technology to help first responders cope with traumatic and high stress situations while on the job, thereby improving their overall health and well-being. The second example is our partnership with a large global client to help employees avoid work related stress. In this example, our client's employees are tasked with sorting through social media content, some of which can cause symptoms and health challenges similar to PTSD. Collaborating with our client, we developed the first end to end stress management application that incorporates artificial intelligence, virtual reality capabilities, and personalized behavioral coaching. Through this approach, we've created a solution that measures individual stress levels real time, identifies social media content, most likely to trigger that stress, and alerts dedicated wellness coaches to engage with individuals who may be exhibiting high levels of stress, helping them through their greatest time of need. The third way we're working to transform healthcare is by leveraging data and technology to serve as a connective tissue between our customers and their healthcare professional partners of choice. To be clear, our strategy guides us to work with partner and enable healthcare professional partners, as they provide care to their patients, not compete with, or disintermediate them. More than ever, people expect coordinated personalized experiences that are similar to those they receive from other industries. This means understanding each person's engagement preferences, health needs and treatment protocols to help us to deliver better, more affordable care one person at a time. Let's take a simple yet critically important example. We know that 50% to 60% of people with chronic illness, miss taking the medication, or take the wrong dose or discontinue treatment prematurely. The cost of inconsistent and incomplete care is staggering, $300 billion in the U.S. alone. Approaching almost 10% of what our country spends on annual health care costs.  One way we're addressing this challenge is by turning it into an opportunity, one individual at a time, leveraging technology to empower patients and providers to address condition specific challenges like diabetes, which impacts more than 30 million people in the United States.  Our glucose monitoring technology enables targeted clinical intervention for people with diabetes, by generating personalized real time analytics, and alerts to inform targeted outreach and coaching from our diabetes specialist pharmacist and clinical teams. Through our diabetes care value program, we provide physicians with the data they need to help people better manage their diabetes. In addition to improving the adherence and clinical outcomes, it also improves quality of life. And within our commercial plans, for example, those enrolled in this program saw a 4.3% decline in spending in 2018 versus a 4.1% increase for these conditions overall. So, as you can see at Cigna, our focus on whole person health is more than just words. It's a clear strategic intent, a focused guide to action, and a catalyst for the development of products, programs and services. Additionally, our approach along with our technology and innovation capabilities has helped us create personalized, high impact, life changing solutions that truly matter to our customers and clients. These are just a few tangible examples of how Cigna is shaping and defining the future of health and wellness. One person, one provider, one client at a time. Now to wrap up, Cigna delivered strong second quarter financial results, reflecting continued momentum across our businesses, including consolidated adjusted revenue of $34.4 billion, and earnings of $1.6 billion. Collectively our second quarter performance results gives us confidence again to raise our revenue and earnings outlook for 2019, representing a 17% to 19% EPS growth rate over Cigna's 2018 performance. Our strong results and our confidence in continued long-term sustainable growth are fueled by a portfolio of leading assets that we connect to provide more complete whole person care for those we serve. And as a result, improving affordability and predictability, as well as personalized quality and sustainability, as we drive for medical costs growth no greater than CPI by 2021. Our four growth businesses give us a path for sustained attractive growth in a dynamic marketplace and regulatory environment, including through ongoing innovation and expansion of our health services, commercial, government and international markets businesses. We remain on track to deliver $20 to $21 of EPS in 2021 and will deliver 10% to 13% average annual EPS growth over the long-term. We're also making very good progress against each of our integration priorities and are on track to achieve our integration goals. With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric. Eric Palmer : Thanks, David. Good morning everyone. In my remarks today, I will review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year. Key consolidated financial highlights for second quarter 2019 include adjusted revenues of $34.4 billion, earnings of $1.6 billion after-tax, earnings per share of $4.30, reflecting continued growth and deepening of customer and client relationships across each of our businesses, underlying strength in medical and pharmacy cost performance, operating expense efficiencies, and the quarter was further aided by the favorable resolution of a tax matter. Second quarter results also included strong cash flow from operations, driven by continued strong execution across our businesses. Regarding our segments, I will first comment on Health Services. Second quarter revenues were $24 billion and pre-tax earnings were $1.16 billion. Results for second quarter reflect organic growth with the addition of 236,000 pharmacy customers in the quarter and $1.9 million customers on a year-to-date basis, strong volumes with 294 million adjusted pharmacy scripts fulfilled in the quarter and continued growth in specialty pharmacy, driven by strong volumes. Overall, Health Services performed very well in the second quarter. Consistent with the seasonal ramp of earnings in this business, Health Services earnings in the second quarter were significantly higher than the first quarter. And as expected, Health Services earnings for the second quarter 2019 were lower than the Express Scripts second quarter 2018 earnings on a comfortable basis. We remain on track for a full year outlook for this business, and I'll provide more commentary on this momentarily. The fundamentals if this business are strong, and we're driving innovation and growth with solutions that deliver differentiated value for our customers and clients. Turning to our Integrated Medical segment, second quarter revenues grew 10% to $9 billion, driven by customer growth and deepening of customer relationships, premium growth reflecting underlying cost trends, and the inclusion of the Express Scripts, Medicare Part D business. We ended the second quarter with 17 million global medical customers, driven by an organic increase of 207,000 lives over second quarter 2018, led by growth in our select and middle market segments, partially offset by lower national accounts enrollment. Second quarter earnings grew 8% to $1 billion, reflecting strong medical and specialty contributions and continued effective medical cost management. Turning to our Medical Care Ratio or MCR, our second quarter MCR of 81.6% reflect strong underlying fundamentals including continued effective medical cost performance. Compared with second quarter 2018, our MCR increased, as expected, due to the inclusion of Express Scripts, Medicare Part D business, the pricing effect of the suspension of the health insurance tax, and a higher MCR in our individual business. As we've discussed previously, we expect margins in our individual business to be lower in 2019 than last year. Second quarter 2019 Integrated Medical earnings benefited from $28 million pre-tax, a favorable net prior year reserved development, compared to $20 million pre-tax in second quarter 2018. Overall, Cigna\u2019s Integrated Medical segment delivered strong results in the second quarter. Turning to our international markets business, revenue grew to $1.4 billion, representing 8% growth over second quarter 2018, on a currency adjusted basis. Second quarter earnings grew to $207 million, reflecting continued business growth and strong margins, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts. For our Group Disability and Other Operations segment, second quarter revenues were $1.3 billion. Second quarter earnings for this segment were $149 million, driven by solid performance in both disability and in life. For our Corporate segment, the second quarter 2019 loss was $453 million, primarily driven by $428 million of interest costs.  Lastly, I would note that the second quarter results include a $45 million non-recurring benefit from the favorable resolution of a tax matter. Overall, Cigna\u2019s second quarter results reflect continued strong revenue and earnings growth led by our Health Services and Integrated Medical businesses. I\u2019ll now discuss our outlook for 2019. For full year 2019, we now expect consolidated adjusted revenues in the range of $136 billion to $137 billion. This represents an increase to our prior outlook of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion, reflecting higher pharmacy contributions. Our increased revenue outlook for 2019 includes approximately $1.5 billion of incremental revenue from the transition of Cigna Pharmacy Script volume from OptumRx, which began in July.  We now expect full year consolidated adjusted income from operations to be in the range of $6.34 billion to $6.46 billion, or $16.60 to $16.90 per share. This represents an increase of $0.25 to $0.35 per share over our prior expectation, and represents growth in the range of 17% to 19% over 2018. For 2019, we now project an expense ratio of less than 10%, which reflects additional revenue leverage, including the in-sourcing of pharmacy services from OptumRx, ongoing efficiencies, and administrative expense synergies. For 2019, we now project the consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 23% to 24%, an improvement of 50 basis points from our previous outlook, primarily reflecting resolution of the tax matter, I mentioned earlier.  I will now discuss our 2019 outlook for the Health Services and Integrated Medical segments. For our Health Services business, we continue to expect full year pre-tax earnings in the range of $5.05 billion to $5.2 billion. Consistent with this outlook, we continue to expect Health Services earnings to be higher in the second half of 2019, than the first half due to several factors. First, we've executed a number of supply chain initiatives in the first half of the year that will take full effect in the second half. I would note that the impact of these initiatives is more heavily weighted to the back half of 2019 compared with the pacing of initiatives in 2018. Second, in the second half of 2019, we expect continued strong performance in specialty pharmacy, including the full run rate benefit of specialty generics introduced earlier this year. And finally, the realization of administrative expense synergies associated with the Cigna Express Scripts combination. These second half growth drivers are partially offset as previously communicated by stranded overhead costs associated with the early termination of the Anthem contract. We now expect adjusted Pharmacy Scripts in the range of 1.21 billion to 1.23 billion scripts, an increase of approximately 40 million scripts from our previous outlook. The increase to our script outlook reflects volumes we expect to transition from OptumRx in 2019. Additionally, for Health Services, we now project a 2020 retention rate in the range of 97% to 98%, an increase of 50 basis points from the midpoint of our previous expectations as our innovative pharmacy solutions continue to resonate in the marketplace, and enable us to deliver greater value for those we serve. For our Integrated Medical business, we now expect full year earnings in the range of $3.78 billion to $3.85 billion, an increase of $50 million to $80 million from our previous outlook. This outlook reflects strength and growth in our businesses, driven by deepening customer relationships, industry leading medical cost trend performance, and well managed administrative expenses. Key assumptions reflected in our Integrated Medical earnings outlook for 2019 include the following. Regarding global medical customers, we now expect 2019 growth of approximately 200,000 customers. Our updated guidance reflects continued growth in the select and middle market segments. Relative to previous expectations, while we continue to project attractive customer growth in middle market and international, our updated outlook now assumes lower growth in those segments. Turning to medical costs, for our U.S. commercial employer book of business, we continue to expect full year 2019 medical costs trend to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. We continue to expect the 2019 medical care ratio to be in the range of 80.5% to 81.5%. I would note that our outlook for both medical costs trend and the medical care ratio is unchanged and is indicative of both stable underlying cost trends across our commercial and government businesses. And our leading approach to driving better clinical and cost outcomes through advanced consumer engagement, physician partnership and further aided by our combination with Express Scripts. We also continue to expect solid contributions from our international markets, group disability and other businesses, as we continue to innovate in the marketplace and deliver a differentiated value for our customers. All in, for full year 2019, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $6.34 billion to $6.46 billion, or $16.60 to $16.90 per share, this represents 17% to 19% growth over 2018. I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of future share repurchases and any additional prior year reserve development. Overall, our updated outlook reflects continued strong execution across our four differentiated growth platforms. Our 2019 outlook is also consistent with our multiyear growth expectations and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our 2021 earnings per share target of $20 to $21 per share. Now moving to our 2019 capital management position and outlook. As previously communicated, our top capital deployment priority is accelerated debt repayment, and we are on track to return our debt to capitalization ratio to the upper 30s by the end of 2020. On an ongoing basis, our capital priorities remain as follows : first, reinvesting back into our businesses for innovation and growth; second, strategic M&A on a targeted basis; and third, returning capital to shareholders primarily through share repurchase. Consistent with these priorities in the second quarter, we deployed $1.3 billion to repay debt and we repurchased 2.6 million shares of stock for $406 million. Additionally, in July, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares for $196 million. Our debt to capitalization ratio was 47.2% as of June 30, 2019, down from 50.9% as of December 31, 2018. For 2019, we continue to project cash flow from operations of approximately $8 billion. In the year, we continue to expect to deploy approximately $4.2 billion to debt repayment. We continue to expect to have capacity for $1.5 billion of share purchases in 2019. And through the end of July, we had already deployed $1.1 billion of that total. Our balance sheet and cash flow from operations outlook remain strong as our capital efficient businesses continue to deliver attractive margins and returns on capital. Now to recap, our second quarter consolidated results reflect continued strong execution and focus on creating differentiated value for our stakeholders. We're well positioned to achieve the attractive financial targets we've established for 2019, and we maintain strong visibility toward our $20 to $21 earnings per share target for 2021. Further, our clear strategic focus, strong fundamentals across our businesses, and outstanding financial flexibility, give us greater confidence in our long-term targets for growth in revenue, earnings and earnings per share.  And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Q - Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I guess, I'll start with David, you mentioned the thought around increasing the level of go deep markets by 25% over the next couple of years. I'm curious how we should be thinking about that in terms of what segments and products are going to be leaders and sort of how do you think about those specific markets in terms of identification process. David Cordani : Josh, good morning, it\u2019s David. First as you know, we've been very successful for quite some time with our go deep approach, in terms of looking at markets MSA by MSA to understand the characteristics the makeup of the client opportunities in those markets, the makeup of the delivery system configuration in those markets, taking into consideration the regulatory environment. And we pretty dynamically managed our portfolio of intense go deep markets and then cultivating additional market opportunities to bring into that portfolio. We see a meaningful growth in front of us so about 25%. As it relates to the products and solutions, you should think about it as from that standpoint, the core of the franchise being leveraged against it. So the select framework, the middle market framework, targeted national accounts opportunities, and very importantly, Medicare Advantage opportunity. So we cross reference all of those. And then finally, we look at the individual or the public exchange business. So this is more on the integrated approach and the integrated side of the house. They're separate initiatives and separate focus on the health services portfolio side of the house.  So, successful past, attractive opportunities in front of us and the ability to leverage those product portfolios through core commercial, individual commercial and MA off of our successful collaborative accountable care relationships. Josh Raskin : Got you. And then just a quick follow up, I got Eric here as well, just on the PBM retention, any more color on sort of bringing up the low end of the previous range is that sales driven, were there a couple of accounts just sort of weren't sure about that have signed on, et cetera? Eric Palmer : Josh, it\u2019s Eric. I would just think of the increase there as we've gotten additional visibility as we continue to move through the year and getting our clients lined up. We're really pleased with the progress that we've had and the dialogue that we've had with our clients, we think 97% to 98% is an outstanding result and pleased to be able to deliver that now two years running in terms of the retention in that segment. Josh Raskin : Perfect. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Matt Borsch : Yes, just on that the more near-term, could you talk to the lower enrollment target on the medical side, and just related to that, how you're seeing the mix of preferences, if I could put it in terms of risk versus ASO and whether maybe the reintroduction of the Obamacare industry fee might be playing some role there? Thank you. David Cordani : Good morning, it's David. So, relative to the membership outlook for the medical customers. First, to be clear, we're very pleased with our track record of sustained commercial growth now that spans 10 years of sustained organic growth. For 2019, we recognize that our outlook is lowered a bit to 200,000 lives still an attractive result that is largely driven by lower commercial national accounts, and a little lower performance at the upper end of the middle market portfolio. I\u2019d remind you that those buyer groups are typically less integrated offerings. We\u2019ve retained outstanding focus in select and core middle market and as such, continue to have strong underlying life growth as well as specialty growth including behavioral, dental, pharmacy, et cetera. As it relates for the mix of business, we have seen a bit more guaranteed cost our risk business over the recent past to complement our ASO strength. And as you recall, we go to market with a diverse portfolio of funding mechanisms and offer choice, it's an inherent strength of our organization. And we believe that the sustained strong medical costs trend performance we've been able to deliver in the marketplace again, posting the lowest rate of growth year-in year-out is resonating well and we\u2019re complementing sustained ASO performance and Stop Loss performance with a bit higher guaranteed cost performance. We do not see that as a corollary to changes within the marketplace year-in year-out. That's a more sustained medical costs performance outlook for us. So good balance in funding mechanisms. And we think that'll continue to perform as we step into 2020. Matt Borsch : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate the comments on the healthcare services result being above expectations. Wanted to follow up there and ask whether you can tell us how this business looked on a year-over-year basis adjusted for all the moving parts. Basically the same way you indicated, it was down modestly in the first quarter, at the Investor Day. And then given we're more than halfway through the year and all the focus on the PBM, I was hoping you might give us a view on where you expect to come in relative to the guidance range at $5.05 to $5.2. Any thoughts whether we should expect to kind of higher end or lower end given we\u2019re seven months into the year. Thanks. Eric Palmer : Justin, it\u2019s Eric. I'll start here. So first of all, just to reiterate the second quarter results were consistent with or even a bit ahead of our expectations, and reflect the strong performance of the businesses there. And particularly strong, especially pharmacy performance and the growth in the volumes as we had expected. As you alluded to, the number of different items in terms of adjusting comparability for this year's second quarter versus Express Scripts standalone items that were reported last year. And I\u2019d point you back to the same factors that we talked about at our Investor Day in terms of that reconciliation is being present here. Also, as you might expect, there are number of different supply chain activities that were on hold kind of at the time period leading up to the close of the combination that we executed over the first part of this year. And we've got good visibility into those in terms of driving results in the back half of the year. So overall, that helps to inform the pattern. So year-on-year we\u2019d characterize the results for the second quarter versus second quarter is down in the single-digits percentage for the quarter. And I\u2019d note as we look ahead then, as you might expect in the third quarter, we expect the pattern to flip. We expect we'll be up mid-single digits, or single-digits in terms of the performance for the Health Services business relative to the Express Scripts piece from last year's third quarter. So we'll bring those capabilities online. The effect of the supply chain initiatives and such will drive us to the growth over the back half of the year. David Cordani : And part of your question relative to the range, we're pleased to be performing solidly throughout the first half of the year, as Eric noted and see a ramp throughout the second half of the year. With the pattern flipping in the second half of the year, as relates to performance in the range. I mean, stay tuned for more. That's right in pace of our execution of our synergies that's in front of us and rate and pace of investments. And we see an exciting into the year and a good start to next year in front of us right now. Justin Lake : Okay. And, Eric, just to be clear, you said mid-single digits down in the second quarter? Eric Palmer : Single digits down in the second quarter. Think about the single digits up in the third quarter. Justin Lake : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. You ask your question. Sarah James : Thank you. When you talk about medical costs trends going to the CPI range in the next couple of years. Should we think about that being ratable so we could see a step down in 2020 cost trend outlook from what you're experiencing this year. And I know it's a small book for you guys where you take risk. But does the lower cost trend correlate to lower pricing? And could that create any SG&A de-levering? Thanks. David Cordani : Sarah good morning. As you may recall from Investor Day, we walked through a little bit of a crosswalk of some of the tools, levers, initiatives we've been executing now for many years to generate a lower medical cost trend in the industry at large. And you may recall Matt Manders walked through a framework that over the last seven years or so we've delivered about a 4% medical cost trend with the last few years being a little closer to 3%. So point one is sustained, point two is trending downward or even more favorable going forward. We're not providing guidance for 2020. So I don't want to tell you anything is ratable. There's dynamism in the portfolio. We're pleased that here in 2019 we're setting about 3.5% to 4.5% medical cost trend outlook, which is by far and away best in the industry yet again, and we have a variety of tools and initiatives in front of us to step down that medical cost trend for the benefit of our clients, customers and patients as we look forward. So, again, I don't want to talk about ratability, rather, the trajectory is positive, it benefits our clients and customers and enhances our overall value proposition.  To the last part of your comment, I would not correlate the size, shape and scope of our portfolio and diversity of our funding mechanisms, we do not -- to be very clear, we do not view that a lower medical cost trend environment could generate less revenue growth, could generate SG&A deleveraging, that is not an issue that we worry about. And I would encourage you not to worry about that, in terms of the diversity of our portfolio and how we deliver services. Sarah James : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Ms. James. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. Just wanted to be -- you guys raised guidance by less like it\u2019s in the upside that we saw in the quarter. So I just wanted to see how you were thinking about that. Is there anything in the back half of the year that you're kind of now incorporating into the outlook? Eric Palmer : Kevin, it's Eric. Well, first, I just note, we're really pleased with the strong results in the quarter and with being in position to be able to raise the guidance again for full year 2019. So I think the 17% to 19% growth coming off of a strong 18% is a good result and reflects the accretion from -- Express Scripts coming through and good momentum and the underlying business. In terms of the outlook pieces, the main thing I\u2019d note here would just be around us continuously managing the rate and pace of our investments and capabilities and such for the future. And so we're taking the opportunity to continue to invest into capabilities and the like. So that'd be the main thing I'd call out in terms of a difference of how we\u2019re seeing the back part of the year versus our prior outlook. Kevin Fischbeck : I guess, one thing that you did kind of change was -- that you're I guess now taking on or including taking on Cigna\u2019s, some of the Cigna\u2019s volume. It sounds like you're just really updating the revenue in the script number, you're not updating the earnings contribution at all. How should we think about that, and does bringing Cigna on add earnings contribution at some point in 2020 or 2021? Eric Palmer : Yes, and that one, go back to some of the dynamics we talked about at our Investor Day in terms of the impact of once we're through the transition and such. But overall, would note and I think you've got the major dynamics, correct there, that the update to revenues, the update to script counts this year primarily are the impacts of the transition do not think of that as a driver in terms of net income as it relates to 2019. Over time, we'd expect the transition to be slightly accretive as it gives us additional fixed cost leverage and the like, but in the short-term and the near-term, wouldn't really think of that as driving the bottom line income. Kevin Fischbeck : Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question. Peter Costa : Good morning, my question is on Medicare Advantage growth for 2020. And I know you're not giving guidance for 2020, but you sort of open the door with your commentary. Are you expecting Medicare Advantage to grow about 10% to 15% in 2020 itself? Or was that something over the three to five years. was that -- appeared to me, whether three to five years just apply to the commercial part of your guidance? And then, with Part D, and also part of Medicare, bids came down 7.2% on average. Do you think you're going to get growth out of your Part D program given where the national average bids are? David Cordani : Peter, good morning, it's David. Let me take the first part of your question. I'll ask Eric to take the second part of your question. First, to be very clear, the three to five years, as you recall that was specific to the timeframe to drive the 25% growth in our go deep market. So you're correct in terms of isolating that acceptable. To the specific part of your question, we see tremendous growth opportunity in MA, starting in 2020. It will be driven by further in market growth and traction. Expanding into new markets. We have multiple new HMO markets and even more markets from a PPO standpoint, which is topic three, expanding into the PPO space.  We had highlighted that that 10% to 15% organic customer life growth is our customer life growth over the near-term to intermediate long-term range, that\u2019s in front of us and we will be at the lower end of that range in 2020 as we ramp the initiatives going forward.  o you don't have to wait three to five years. But think about it the lower end of the range as we step into 2020 and ramping up as we go forward. I'll ask Eric to answer the second part of the question. Eric Palmer : Yes, Peter, on the Part D benchmarks again, not providing the specific guidance in terms of 2020 at this point. But I would just know that the benchmarks were actually quite consistent with how we were thinking about them. There weren't any big surprises in terms of our view of where the benchmarks came through. Overall, we'll be in a better position to provide customer growth guidance as the full visibility into all the competitors positioning is kind of region by region comes into view. And we work through our marketing plans there, but overall, no surprises in terms of where the benchmarks came through. Peter Costa : Thanks. That's helpful. Just as a follow up, David, the 10% or so growth, that you're talking about for 2020. You also talk about county expansions, the first year you see the growth in membership that\u2019s usually not in Medicare, very profitable. And the county expansions are usually fairly costly. Can you -- so do you think Medicare can be a drag on your earnings in 2020 and then grow from there? David Cordani : We haven\u2019t provided 2020 earnings guidance, we will do that as the year comes to a close. Step up in the overall portfolio will have attractive growth in our overall enterprise earnings portfolio for 2020 that guides us to 2021. So stay tuned for the guidance as we provide for 2020 from that standpoint, but we think we have a very attractive both growth and overall fundamental earnings profile for the business. Peter Costa : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Costa. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. You may ask your question. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks, good morning. First just wanted to go to the MLR [ph] that came in a little bit higher, I know you contributed -- you attributed to a few of the different things it seemed like the incremental piece, maybe the individual business at least relative to kind of 1Q. If you could just maybe break out what you're seeing there, and maybe your commitment to expansion in that market? Thanks. Eric Palmer : Yes, Ralph, it\u2019s Eric. On the loss ratio, so a couple of different comparison points to think about there. The biggest driver from a sequential perspective versus 1Q is just up to the normal seasonality of things as we work through the customers kind of coming through deductibles and working through that ramp. In terms of the drivers, in terms of the second quarter year-on-year, really three things that I would point to, and they're each about the same impact. So roughly a 30 each, that's the inclusion of the Express Scripts is being part of the loss ratio this year and not part of the calculation last year, the Part D business specifically, one. Two, the pricing effects of the suspension of the industry fee. And third, is the IFP, the individual segment margin this year versus last year. Each one of those three factors is about a third of the variants when we think about things quarter versus quarter. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay, that's helpful. And then just quickly wanted, I hope, you could flush out the lower enrollment growth commentary, specifically in select middle markets. I think you said in the prepared remarks, you've obviously had a lot of success there for some time and done well with sort of bundling your specialty lines. A lot more recently your peers have talked more aggressively moving in that direction. So, just hoping if you could give us a little bit of sense as sort of the competitive dynamic there both as it relates to sort of the medical side as well as some of those specialty lines in terms of competition. Thanks. David Cordani : Ralph, good morning, it's David. Very specifically our select portfolio continues to perform very well. And within the select portfolio, you're correct, we go to market with a fully integrated solution. We\u2019d remind you that we use the full breadth of the funding mechanisms that exists if you will, asking and allowing and working consultatively with our employer clients one by one to determine how they want to best finance their solution that resonates quite well for us. And then we continue to drive very good targeted innovation in our clinical programs and our coaching programs and our service programs, et cetera.  In the core middle market capabilities, we continue to perform very well, and as I noted in a prior question, we have seen a little lower performance in the high end or the upper end of the middle market, where there's a little less integrated offering.  Lastly to the overall, point of your question, the marketplace is competitive has been competitive and will be competitive going forward. So it's a dynamic market. Our points of differentiation continue to resonate well. And importantly, our underlying fundamental medical costs performance continues to resonate well. And then, as Eric noted, we continue to invest in on ongoing innovation, so we're poised for continued strong growth in the space. Ralph Giacobbe : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with J.P. Morgan. You may ask your question. Gary Taylor : Hey, good morning. I appreciate the commentary about the PBM and given how focused the Street is on that metric. I just want to clarify that we're on the same page. So if you look at the second quarter of 2018, ESI reported $1.395 billion of core EBITDA if we grow that mid-single digit 5%, that's about $1.465 billion, which would represent about a $250 million sequential increase. I just want to make sure those are sort of the numbers that we're talking about for the 3Q? Eric Palmer : Yes, Gary, it's Eric. So I would say my commentary in terms of our expectation for growth on 3Q would be on an apples-to-apples basis. So once you take the Express Scripts reported numbers and adjust for the items that we talked about at the Investor Day our re-segmentation, the changes in terms of depreciation and amortization, the change in terms of the enterprise value initiative, and then the work from there. Once you get to that baseline, then we would grow from that baseline. That's the basis that we're speaking to. Gary Taylor : So on an adjusted basis, not as reported basis, so I'm glad I clarified that then. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Taylor. Our next question comes from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Steve Tanal : Good morning, guys. You\u2019ve obviously covered a lot of ground, I guess just one thing, maybe if you could give us a little bit more commentary on sort of MCR by line of business, maybe thinking year-on-year, but if you could just touch on sort of the key things there commercial, Medicare, Medicaid, how those performed relative to expectations. And then maybe just within that line thinking about all the good growth and market share gains you've had in the commercial risk side of the business, how are those margins sort of relative to the overall average or base business if you wouldn\u2019t mind commenting there? Thanks a lot. Eric Palmer : Steve, it's Eric. So on the loss ratio it\u2019s kind of by business, actually, we really put both of them right down the middle. So consistent with expectations and consistent performance in both the commercial and the government business. So feel good about those. The Medicaid business is a small business for us, but has actually performed consistent with our targets as well. So, again, certainly no variation that I\u2019d call out in terms of the commercial versus the government versus the Medicaid business, to note in the quarter. David Cordani : And Steven, relative to the question relative to -- I think your -- second part of your question around the margins and margin differentiation by funding mechanism or type of business. If you step back from that, you may recall that our approach to the marketplace is such that we're a bit funding mechanism agnostic. So that enables our sales force our client managers, et cetera, toward client by client to determine the last step which is once the right solution is put in place in terms of clinical programs, network design, service program designs, et cetera. How do you want to fund and finance it. So backing into that, that means that when you look at on an apples-to-apples basis, in general, the margins and the returns across the various funding mechanisms are attractive and have some similarity relative to them. There are some nuances, but think about the margins as being strong and differentiated in guaranteed cost. Think about the margins, that are being strong and differentiated in our core packaged ASO Stop Loss portfolio businesses. Hope that helps. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Tanal. Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. A.J. Rice: Hello, everybody, just maybe a post mortem on the selling season and a quick clarification with Eric, on the PBM selling season. I know when -- I think when I was out there, in a headquarter visit back in the spring, there was a discussion about the fact that this year there was less business in Express Scripts side up for renewal than there had been last year.  So you'd be more on the offense and it sounded like that was the expectation for 2020. And I want to see if you still -- so next year selling season. And I also -- there has been some discussion by peers about people delay because of all the change in the marketplace, on RFPs and postponing for a year. I wanted to see, do we think that the RFPs have been pushed out till next year. And we'll see a big overall opportunity that way next year? And then just a quick point of clarification for some discussion on guidance, as Eric said, because I know you won't comment on it, if you don't comment on this call. Is there anything did you guys would say about the Q3 versus Q4 split, I know you're talking about synergies and PDB seasonality, which would tend to push people into the fourth quarter versus the third, relative to historic trends. Is there anything you want to say about the Q3-Q4 split? David Cordani : A.J., it\u2019s David, let me take your first question. And, obviously, Eric will take the second piece of it. So your recollection is pretty clear, the 2019 selling season for the core pharmacy services business had higher volume of business on a relative basis. That's cycle time. So there's cycles on the contracts and it was a more intense cycle. And as Eric noted, just outstanding client retention. 2020 selling season, which is far into the season right now.  From that standpoint, is shaping up very favorably from a client retention level again, which underscores the strong sustained service level delivery, the strong sustained clinical delivery, the strong sustained overall cost delivery and continued investment from an innovation standpoint. And as articulated at I-Day we expect fundamentally to grow that portfolio businesses in 2020 aided by outstanding retention as well as new business growth. To the last part of your question, no, we don't believe or see any unique pent up volume for our fees being held back versus not because you're dealing with large sophisticated helpline contracts, large sophisticated commercial employer contracts that are typically on a multiyear cycle. So we do not see a bubble coming on the immediate horizon from that standpoint and see our value proposition is resonating very well as evidenced the growth in 2019 and our growth outlook for 2027. Eric, I'll ask you to take the second question. Eric Palmer : Sure. A.J., just on your seasonality, we're not providing a specific guidance in terms of third quarter versus fourth quarter. But there are a handful of items I\u2019d point you to as you think about the expectations over the back part of the year.  First of all, our Integrated Medical segment, as you know, has income that tends to be bias towards the early part of the year, just given the normal seasonal impact of deductibles and such. Second of all, the Health Services business tends to be biased later in the year due to both customer behavior and growth in script volumes and just the timing of generic launches. And we've talked about the ramp that we\u2019re on 1Q to 2Q to Q3 to Q4 over the year for that business. And additionally, this year specifically, you should expect the synergies to continue to build throughout the year and the impact of deleveraging to continue to play through the corporate segment over the course of the year. So those will be the major moving items that I\u2019d think about as we look sequentially into the next couple of quarters. A.J. Rice: Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question. David Stybloin : Hi, there. Good morning. It's Dave Stybloin for Windley. Just want to come back to the MLR. It sounds like overall that was largely in-line with how you guys were thinking it would be. I guess, maybe you could help us understand how it's changed a little bit in the first couple of quarters because as we look at that in the first quarter, it was up 140 basis points year-over-year, and then this quarter, it's up 260 basis points. So wondering, what explains that increase? And then, I guess, guidance implies for the rest of the year that it would come back down to right around 200 basis points. So, maybe just understanding the cadence of the spike up in 2Q would be helpful. Eric Palmer : Dave, it's Eric. So just on those pieces, I think you've got the math right there in terms of the moving pieces and the components. The things I would point you toward would be just the timing of which the prior year reserve development has kind of unfolded and in year development of cost, this year's second quarter versus last year's second quarter. Last year's second quarter, we had more in year development in the second quarter than we had this year, just to given the favor ability that we experienced an individual book of business last year. So I really think of it more as an adjustment to the last year first Q -- first quarter to second quarter dynamic versus anything else going on this year, broadly would characterize the loss ratio dynamics in our second quarter this year is aligned with our expectations. David Stybloin : Okay, great. Thanks. And then any quick color on the national accounts since the enrollments been down sequentially, both in the first couple quarters is there something on the competitive front side or maybe just elaborate there on the erosion? David Cordani : Good morning, it's David. So specific to national accounts first in the commercial space, so not in the server side of the equation, but in the commercial space. Let me remind you how we define national accounts because we define it differently than the marketplace. It\u2019s commercial only 5,000 or more employees that are multi-state. So very specifically that excludes large single state blocks of business where that's a fundamental part of our middle market business. For the past year we saw an elevated RFP volume, the cycle we are in, we saw a little bit more elevated RFP volume. We saw reasonable retention levels across our portfolio and reasonable new penetration levels in the portfolio and some new business wins, which resulted in some net overall loss in the portfolio. I would note that our strategy have continuing to deepen our relationship in our clients is working well. So we're deepening the relationship in our existing national account clients with our specialty portfolio, which result in more value we can deliver for them, as well as an enhanced overall earnings profile. We do not see an overall change in the market behavior from a purchasing standpoint. We do not see any unique different value propositions resonating in the market. We just saw a little lower retention level and a little lower new business adds for 2019 than we had anticipated. Operator : Thank you Mr. Windley. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. You may ask your question. Steven Valiquette : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So not to beat the MLR topic with that. But since you did sort of touch on seasonality and sequential comparison factors, with the 2Q MLR coming in slightly above the full year range and was it always contemplated, internally assuming that 2Q would be above the full year range. And should we expect that sort of seasonal pattern on an annual basis going forward? And then just quickly within the individual medical business since you flag that just in the context of the MLR, curious if you received any sort of risk adjustment true up in 2Q 2019 and how that might have compared versus anything you've received in the same quarter last year. And was right in line with your expectations? Thanks. Eric Palmer : Steve, it's Eric. So overall, with respect to the loss ratio, we continue to be on track for our full year guidance. We've got good visibility to achieving the loss ratio guidance. So, no change there. And as I pointed out, the dynamics in terms of the second quarter were fully contemplated. Now, specifically on a risk adjustment true up, we did record a risk adjustment item in the individual business in the second quarter this year, order of magnitude $40 million to $50 million pre-tax. So -- and that's an unfavorable true up, that was in the result this year. But again, in line with the expectations in terms of the margin being a bit more compressed in the individual business this year. And we continue to be on track for the full year outlook. Steven Valiquette : Okay. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Alexa [ph] in for Ricky. Thanks for taking my question. Just to clarify, you guys talked about third quarter being up single digits from an adjusted EBITDA per script perspective. That include the influencing of the Cigna business, or is that just on an apples-to-apples basis? Eric Palmer : Alexa, it's Eric. So just to be clear, we did not say on a per script basis. We just talked about the aggregate dollars reported in the Health Services segment compared to an adjusted or recast, Express Scripts number to get it to an apples-to-apples basis. We're just talking about the total adjusted income from operations pre-tax will have growth in Health Services segment in the third quarter. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Goldwasser. Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. You may ask your question Lance Wilkes : Yes, just a couple clarifications or questions on the PBM more on the Health Services segment. For the strength you shown in specialty pharmacy, could you just talk a little bit about how you're achieving that if that is related to sort of supply chain initiatives or steerage and leakage or if it is more OpEx kind of synergies related to consolidation with the Cigna book? And then, I guess, also just interested in your outlook for cross sales in PBM for 2020, in particular, with a stronger capability as you look up market in that segment? David Cordani : Hi Lance, it's David. First specific to specialty pharmacy, we're extremely pleased with the performance of our specialty pharmacy services that are delivered through Accredo. Just stepping back for a moment, as you know we deliver an exceptional patient clinical outcome and service outcome one patient at a time. And as such work to deliver the right affordability outcome and our overall costs outcome leads the industry from that standpoint. And this is a validation of the kind of satisfaction level. We have NPS approaching 80 patients that are in our high clinical coordination programs. As it relates to the growth, think about underlying fundamental growth. So in addition to specialty pharmaceutical costs being the fastest cost growth sector. We have deepening relationships in terms of growing the overall portfolio, legacy attached to the PBM business, we start to convert over the Cigna business. And then importantly, because of the robustness of the Accredo value proposition, Accredo is sold on a standalone basis on a day-in day-out basis to both employers as well as health plans in terms of helping to coordinate the specialty services.  So strong underlying fundamentals is what you should think about growing it. Not expenses or otherwise through that lens.  As it relates to your forward looking question, we do say the opportunity for further -- to your point either cross seller penetration opportunities. Because we're able to get the best of both companies. indisputably we get both more structural flexibility in terms of benefit and solution design, attached to the broad portfolio of Express Scripts capabilities, as well as even a further step function to the overall affordability proposition and clinical services proposition. And we believe to your point that will serve us well, if you will, up market as it relates to cross selling, that standalone value proposition continues to resonate, it continues to resonate in the health plan marketplace, and some of those capabilities will help our commercial sector as well. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Wilkes. Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. You may ask your question. Charles Rhyee : Yes, thanks. Just two quick ones here. One, can you give us a sense on sort of the pacing we should think about as the -- as you kind of in-source your -- the signal volumes onto the Express platform. And how should we still break it up between maybe think about it between third quarter and fourth quarter the models? And then, secondly, I apologize, I missed it earlier. Can you give your thoughts on sort of the Senate Finance Committee bill here, particularly as it relates to Part D, sort of the re-envisioning how the structure of it getting rid of the donor hole putting more a larger catastrophic and what that means sort of from the plan perspective, and do you think that that will lead to more utilization as a result of lower cost for seniors? Thanks. Eric Palmer : Charles, it\u2019s Eric. I'll start on the kind of pacing item. We haven't provided any specific expectations there other than just the aggregate numbers that we\u2019ve talked about. So as I noted in my prepared remarks, think about the in-sourcing is worth $1.5 billion over the back half of the year, and $40 million to $45 million in scripts coming through over the back half of the year associated with the transition. I'd also refer you back to the material we used at our Investor Day a couple of months back now in terms of the complete impact once we get to 2021, in terms of the volumes and such there. I\u2019ll let David take the second part of your question. David Cordani : Charles, good morning. As it relates to specifically the Senate Finance bill or if you step back more broadly, continues to be a significant amount of public policy and legislative activity under consideration that seeks to improve overall affordability and improve specifically overall affordability relative to pharmaceutical services. Everything we are seeking to do in terms of leveraging the best of both companies is seeking to deliver improved affordability off of a basis of strength. So, importantly, directionally aligned with the initiatives to seek to improve more affordability and choice from that standpoint. As it relates to the specificity of your question down to PDP, donut hole, et cetera. Once the final terms of a bill, if a bill was to be passed, or determined, we would obviously react an engage from that standpoint. I think more broadly, I'd asked you to think about the capabilities the corporation has are well positioned to make sure we're able to deliver the best possible value, in this case for individual Medicare PDP customers over whether it's pre-donut hole, during donut hole or post donut hole from that standpoint, from a framing around the clinical coordination, access and overall affordability standpoint. So we're highly engaged and aligned with improving overall affordability. And the structure of our technology and innovative solutions puts us in good position, not just to react to but actually be in a leadership position as the programs change. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rhyee. Our last question comes from David McDonald with SunTrust. You may ask your question. David McDonald : Good morning. David, just two quick questions. First on the PBM selling ciders and anything of note that you would call out in terms of plan design changes that you guys are seeing? And I guess to build on Lance's question, are you continuing to see narrowing of specialty networks in the business that you can? And then secondly, any initiatives in terms of trying to drive incremental mail, just given the likely adherence benefits and the connectivity opportunity it offers with the patients, especially the chronics? David Cordani : David, good morning. So, a variety of attributes in your question. Stepping back, our orientation relative to benefit design, specialty design, mail order incentive, or design, et cetera. It's a one client at a time approach.  So I'll try to give you a macro piece, but really importantly, we do not go to market with a product or a preferred solution offering and try to force it, we try to work one client at a time, whether it's a commercial client or health plan client from that standpoint, and try to design what works for them based upon the strategy, the culture, the need set, et cetera. And to your point, we pull from a broad portfolio of capabilities around that. As it relates to design, more receptivity today than ever relative to pursuing value based care or value based reward configurations, especially in the specialty environment. That may lead to a little bit more focused on some of the subspecialties and recall that Accredo is not for example, one Specialty Pharmacy, there\u2019s 15 sub-specialty pharmacies within that that specialize based on health or disease burden from that standpoint. Similarly as it comes to mail, you're correct, the -- it's indisputable the dispensing accuracy and the clinical compliance is higher in that highly coordinated fashion of what's delivered there. And in many cases, clients are revisiting that seeking a further step function or value creation for the benefit of their employees, our customers or our patients. And we see good receptivity around that. But I can't tell you that mail order is kind of binary going from more intensified approach in 2020 than it was in 2019. There is receptivity, but it's client-by-client from that standpoint. And we think that's an inherent strength of our company to be consultative from that standpoint. Operator : Thank you Mr. McDonald. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : Thank you. So briefly just to wrap up our call, I'd like to highlight some of the key points from our discussion. Overall, we're very pleased with our second quarter results, which continue to demonstrate momentum across our portfolio of businesses.  We are also making very good progress against each of our integration priorities and are on track to achieve our integration goals. Looking ahead, our second quarter results and our integration progress gives us confidence to again raise our revenue and earnings outlook for 2019, representing a 17% to 19% EPS growth rate off of Cigna's strong 2018 performance. And we are on track to deliver our $20 to $21 EPS objective in 2021 as we expect to deliver 10% to 13% on average annual EPS growth over the long-term. In addition, we continue to drive cost trend to a level in line with CPI by 2021. We thank you for joining our call today. And we look forward to our further discussions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's second quarter 2019 results review. Cigna Investor Relations will be available to response additional questions shortly.

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter queue to ask question at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen this conference including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We will begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell. William McDowell : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I\u2019m Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me this morning are; David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics including Cigna's third quarter 2019 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2019. As noted in our earnings release when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues which are not determined in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income, and total revenues respectively is contained in today's earnings release which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled Adjusted Income from Operations and Earnings Per Share on this same basis as our principle measures of financial performance. I will remind you that as previously disclosed, we exclude contributions from transitioning clients from adjusted income from operations, and adjusted revenue. In our remarks today, we will be making some Forward-Looking Statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2019 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the third quarter we recorded an after tax special item charge of $88 million or $0.24 per share for integration and transaction related costs. We also recorded a special item benefit of $23 million after tax or $0.06 per share, for the favorable revolution of litigation matter. As described in today\u2019s earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations, in our discussion of financial results. Please note that consistent with best practice, when we make prospective comments, regarding financial performance, including our full-year 2019 outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future share repurchases or additional prior year development of medical costs. And with that, I will turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks, Will. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our call. Today I will highlight Cigna's strong third quarter financial results, which reflect continued momentum across our businesses including strong earnings growth in our Health Services business. I will highlight our diverse business portfolio and unique capabilities position us to deliver sustained growth in 2019 and over the long-term. As we continue to serve the needs of employers, health plans, government clients an individual customer. I will also share initial thoughts and how we will drive strong growth in 2020 as we remain on-track to deliver our 2021 EPS target of $20 to $21 per share and cash flow from operations of at least $8.5 billion. Turning to our third-quarter results. We again delivered strong performance across our businesses, lead by Health Services and Integrated Medical. Cigna consolidated adjusted revenue for the quarter was $35.8 billion and we grew earnings to $1.7 million. These results reflect strong retention and continued expansion of customer relationships and significant ongoing operating cash flow generation, which fueled our strategic capital deployment. In our Health Services segment, we again delivered significant customer and revenue growth and as expected attractive year-over-year earnings growth for the quarter. Our performance in Integrated Medical is highlighted by customer growth, the expansion of relationships and ongoing differentiated medical cost management. Our third-quarter results give us confidence that we will achieve our increased 2019 outlook for revenue, earnings and EPS with expected EPS growth of 18% to 20% over Cigna's strong 2018 performance. As our result continue to demonstrate our unique configuration of assets enables us to meet the diverse needs of the marketplace, which in turn positions us to deliver strong, sustained financial performance for shareholders. When you consider today's marketplace needs, we continue to confront an affordability challenge in healthcare environment where far too often outcomes are suboptimal. Too frequently individuals experience issues such as overdiagnosis, inconsistent care coordination and avoidable hospital readmissions just to name a few examples. All of this result in higher costs and missed opportunities for health improvement. At Cigna we have broad capabilities needed to address these issues and to make the overall healthcare experience a better and more seamless one for those we serve. Our combination of assets brings together the best in medical, pharmacy and behavioral health. To ensure high-quality coordinated care is delivered when and where our customers needed, weather at work at home on the go. To our capabilities and actions were able to keep healthy people healthy. We address risk factors for healthy risk and we coordinate the needed care for chronically ill individuals. All of this positions us to drive affordability and better predictability one customer and one patient at a time. Because our approach resonates so well in the marketplace were able to generate attractive sustained long-term performance, including attractive operating cash flows. This result in significant financial flexibility which is a key strategic asset that supports continued strong performance and long-term growth in a highly disruptive environment. Our sustained financial performance is also fueled by our four growth platforms, Health Services commercial employer, government and international. We are able to drive attractive growth across each of these businesses by effectively leveraging our collective capabilities and coordinating our service offerings to meet the needs of those we serve around the world. For example in Health Services, we consistently demonstrate deep expertise in coordinated pharmacy services and unique innovations in clinical programs resulting in a leading pharmacy trend performance for the benefit of our employer, health plan and government clients. Collectively, these continue to drive exceptional customer and client satisfaction, resulting in a projected retention rate of 97% for 2020, and the addition of new business, resulting in, for example, organic prescription growth, which we project will be between 25 million and 35 million in 2020. In our commercial employer business we continue to drive organic customer growth for the 10th consecutive year best amongst our peers. This includes capitalizing on the meaningful head room for growth in our select and middle market segments, which comprise approximately 65% of the addressable U.S. commercial employer market. It need to increase our focus on delivering innovative commercial solutions that address whole person health needs for employers in the United States and abroad. With medical pharmacy and behavioral solutions that we delivered a fully integrated way. We are also very well positioned for accelerated growth in our U.S. government business. We are excited with the outstanding value proposition we have in Medicare Advantage today and how we are positioned going into 2020. Including excellent stars ratings with 77% of our customers in four star plus plan for next year and that will increase to 85% in 2021. VD MPS measures averaging approximately 70 across all our markets. And our ability to leverage aligned value-based physician arrangements to provide a well coordinated care experience for our customers. Together all these fuels our geographic and product expansion plans for 2020 and gives us confidence we will deliver Medicare Advantage customer growth of at least 10% in 2020. Now relative to our combination with express scripts. We continue to make very good progress here. In 2019 this includes the effective integration of a medical client into our credo specialty pharmacy capability which is largely complete and will be finalized by the end of 2019. And the addition of Express Scripts high-performing home delivery pharmacy to our Cigna network. We have also made Safeguard RX, RationalMed and Health Connect 360 capabilities available for medical customers, further positioning us to increase choice and access, reduce costs and help to further avoid gaps in care and ensure customers get the clinical support they need when and how they want it. As we previously discussed, we also launched several new innovative capabilities available to commercial and health plan clients. These include our patient's insurance program where coordinated capabilities enabled us to engineer the supply chain giving our customers access to insulin for $25 co-pay per month. And/or embark benefit protection program, which brings together the best of our combined capabilities to build a pathway to better affordable care for potentially life-changing gene therapies. As we brought together businesses, we have continued to deliver strong results, accelerated by the synergies over combination. Reflecting this performance, we have - we have now increased a revenue and earnings outlook for the third consecutive quarter this year. Now turning your attention briefly to our initial outlook for 2020, we expect attractive EPS growth next year, and remain on-track to deliver on our 2021 EPS goal of $20 to $21 per share. Our 2019 outlook represents 18% to 20% EPS growth with a midpoint of $16.90 per share. As we step into 2020, I call out a few headwinds from nonrecurring items, including first the absence of prior year reserve development, second the absence of a tax matter that we favorably settled in second quarter of 2019 and finally, the return of the health insurance tax. These three items represent a $0.50 headwind as we step into 2020 giving us an adjusted jump off point of $16.40 at the midpoint. For 2020, we expect to grow earnings per share 10% to 13% over this amount, in-line with our long-term EPS growth expectation. This growth will be driven by sustained organic growth across our well-positioned growth platforms, favorable impact of deleveraging and further administrative expense synergies. All-in we are positioned for sustained attractive earnings growth for 2020, and remain on-track to achieve our strategic goal of $20 to $21 EPS of 2021. In addition, our strong operating momentum and capital light framework will continue to drive attractive cash flow and enhance our strategic and financial flexibility over the intermediate and long-term. Now to ramp up, Cigna delivered strong third quarter financial results, with continued momentum across our businesses, including earnings growth for Health Services and Integrated Medical business. Strong retention and expansion of customer relationships and significant ongoing operating cash flow generation and capital deployment. Collectively our third quarter results give us confidence we will achieve our increased 2019 revenue and earnings outlook representing and 18% to 20% EPS growth rate over Cigna\u2019s strong 2018 performance. Our integration of Express Scripts is tracking well and we are delivering a number of meaningful benefits for our customers, patients, clients and shareholders. For 2021 we remain on-track to deliver $20 to $21, EPS and cash flow from operations of at least $8.5 billion. We remain committed to delivering 10% to 13% average annual EPS growth over the long-term. And with that, I will turn the call over to Eric. Eric Palmer : Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will review key aspects of Cigna third quarter results and discuss our updated outlook for the full-year. Key consolidated financial highlights for third quarter 2019 include adjusted revenues of $35.8 billion, earnings of $1.7 billion after tax, and earnings per share of $4.54 reflecting continued strong execution across each of our businesses, with particular strength and momentum in both Health Services and Integrated Medical. Third quarter results also included strong cash flow from operations, driven by continued strong execution across our businesses. Regarding our segments, I will first comment on Health Services third quarter adjusted revenues were $25 billion and pre-tax earnings were $1.4 billion. Results for third quarter reflect organic growth with the addition of 492,000 pharmacy customers in the quarter and 2.4 million customers on a year-to-date basis, strong volumes with 312 million adjusted pharmacy script fulfilled in the quarter, continued growth in specialty pharmacy and the effective execution of supply chain initiatives. Overall, Health Services performed very well in the third quarter. As expected, Health Services earnings in the quarter grew relative to Express Scripts third quarter 2018 earnings on a comparable basis. As you heard from David the fundamentals of this business are strong, we are delivering innovative solutions like Embark and the patient assurance program for the benefit of customers and clients and we continue to hit our key milestones as we progress with our integration priorities. Turning to our Integrated Medical segment, third quarter revenues grew 12% to $9 billion driven by customer growth premium growth reflecting underlying cost trends and the inclusion of the Express Scripts Medicare Part D business. We ended the third quarter with 17.1 million global medical customers, an organic increase of 212,000 lives over third quarter 2018, led by growth in our select and middle market segments, partially offset by lower national account enrollment. Third quarter earnings grew to $953 million reflecting strong medical and specialty contributions and continued effective medical cost management, all while continuing to invest to drive future growth. Turning to our Medical Care Ratio or MCR, our third quarter MCR of 80.5% reflects strong underlying fundamentals, including continued effective medical cost performance. Compared with third quarter 2018, our MCR increased as expected due to the price in effect of the suspension of the health insurance tax, the higher MCR in our individual business and the effect on medical costs of one additional week day in the third quarter. Third quarter 2019 Integrated Medical earnings benefited from $8 million pre-tax of favorable net prior year reserve development compared to $18 million in the third quarter of 2018. Overall Cigna\u2019s Integrated Medical segment delivered strong results in the third quarter. Turning to our international markets business, revenues grew to $1.4 billion representing 9% growth over third quarter 2018 on a currency-adjusted basis third quarter earnings were $194 million, reflecting continued business growth and operational efficiency, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts. For our group disability and other operation segment, third quarter revenues were $1.3 billion, third quarter earnings for this segment were $143 million driven by solid performance in both disability and in life. For our corporate segment, the third quarter 2018 loss was $442 million, primarily driven by $409 million of interest costs. Overall, Cigna\u2019s third quarter results reflect continued strong revenue and earnings growth, led by our Health Services and Integrated Medical businesses. I will now discuss our updated outlook for 2019. For full-year 2019, we now expect consolidated adjusted revenues of approximately $138 billion. This represents an increase to our prior outlook of $1.5 billion at the midpoint, reflecting higher contributions from our Health Services business. We now expect full-year consolidated adjusted income from operations to be in the range of $6.38 billion to $6.46 billion or $16.80 to $17.00 per share this represents an increase of $0.10 to $0.20 per share over our prior expectations and represents a growth in the range of 18% to 20% over 2018. For 2019, we now project a consolidated adjusted tax rate of approximately 23%. I will now discuss our to our 2019 outlook for the Health Services and Integrated Medical segments. For our Health Services business, we now expect full-year pre-tax earnings in the range of $5.075 billion to $5.175 billion. Consistent with this outlook, we expect a continued ramp and sequential earnings for this business driven by normal seasonality as well as previously communicated factors including the run rate impact of supply chain initiatives completed in the first half of 2019. Continued strong performance in specialty pharmacy and the realization of administrative expense synergies associated with the Cigna Express Scripts combination. For 2019, we now expect adjusted pharmacy script of approximately 1.22 billion scripts, which is the midpoint of our previously communicated range. Additionally for Health Services, we now project 2020 retention rate of 97%, demonstrating that our innovative pharmacy solutions continue to resonate in the marketplace and enable us to deliver greater value for those we serve. This strong retention fuels our expectation for organic scripts growth of $25 million to $35 million adjusted pharmacy scripts in 2020. For our Integrated Medical business, we now expect full-year earnings in the range of $3.8 billion to $3.85 billion. This outlook reflects strength and growth in our businesses driven by deepening customer relationships, industry leading medical cost trend performance and well managed administrative expenses. Key assumptions reflected in our Integrated Medical earnings outlook for 2019 include the following; Regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect 2019 growth of approximately 200,000 customers. Our guidance reflects continued growth in select and middle market, partially offset by a decline in national accounts. Turning to medical costs for our U.S. commercial employer book of business, we continue to expect full-year 2019 medical cost trend to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. We now expect the 2019 medical care ratio to be in the range of 80.8% to 81.2% and narrowing of the range from our prior expectations reflecting ongoing disciplined medical cost management. All-in, we continue to see strong outcomes from our clinical, consumer and physician engagement model. We also continue to expect solid contributions from our international markets, group disability and other businesses, as we continue to innovate in the marketplace and deliver differentiated value for our customers. All-in for 2019 we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $6.38 billion to $6.46 billion or $16.80 to $17.00 per share, this represents 18% to 20% growth over 2018. I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of future share repurchases and any additional prior year reserve development. Our updated outlook reflects the strong performance we are delivering in 2019 and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our 2021 earnings per share target of $20 to $21 per share. Now moving to our 2019 capital management position and outlook. As previously communicated, we have a near-term focus on accelerated debt repayment and have deployed $3.7 billion through the end of third quarter to repay debt. We remain on-track to return our debt to capitalization ratio to the upper '30s by the end of 2020. Our long-term capital priorities remain as follows : First, reinvesting back into our businesses for innovation and growth. Second strategic M&A on a targeted basis and third, returning capital to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase. Consistent with these priorities in the third quarter, we deployed $450 million to repay debt and we repurchased 4.2 million shares of stock for $676 million. Additionally, in October, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares for $236 million. Our debt to capitalization ratio was 46.4% as of September 30, 2019, down from 50.9% as of December 31, 2018. For 2019, we now project cash flow from operations of greater than $8 billion and this year, we continue to expect to deploy approximately $4.2 billion to debt repayment. We now expect to have capacity for $2 billion of share repurchases in 2019, an increase of $500 million from our previously stated capacity. Through the end of October, we had already deployed $1.8 billion of that total. Our balance sheet and cash flow from operations outlook remains strong as our capital efficient businesses continue to deliver attractive margins and returns on capital. Now to recap, our third quarter consolidated results reflect continued strong execution and focus on creating differentiated value for our stakeholders. We are well positioned to achieve the attractive financial targets we have established for 2019 and we maintain strong visibility toward our 2021 targets of $20 to $21 of earnings per share and greater than $8.5 billion in cash flow from operations. Further, our clear strategic focus strong fundamentals across our businesses and outstanding financial flexibility, gives us continued confidence in our long-term targets for growth in revenue, earnings and EPS. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question our first question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question. Josh Raskin : Thanks and good morning here with Mr. [indiscernible] as well. So we are coming up on one year post Express, it seems like you guys have a pretty good handle on the operations, things are going according to plan, maybe a little bit better, debt to cap coming down to mid '40s. As you think about your overall portfolio of assets and I'm thinking specifically around some of the global SAP businesses. Can you remind us sort of the long-term growth profile of those businesses and maybe juxtapose that with the U.S. Medical and PBM segments now and kind of the synergies amongst, I'm just trying to understand the importance to Cigna overall in terms of having that broad portfolio versus being a little bit more targeted now in the U.S. benefits businesses? Eric Palmer : Yes Josh, it is Eric. Just to start we provided some growth rates and expectations back at our Investor Day earlier this year. The international businesses. Overall, we would expect to grow in the 8% to 10% top line and a little bit better than that bottom line on a sustained basis. So 9% to 11% earnings across that portfolio. So we think it is a really attractive set of capabilities and there are markets where we are well positioned to operate in and good connectivity between the international businesses back to our U.S. businesses so an important part of the portfolio overall. In total, we continue to see good visibility to driving an enterprise growth rate 6% to 8%, both at the top line and bottom line. So the international markets business is actually faster growing part of the portfolio and an important one for us to build on. David, maybe you can add some other comments. David Cordani : Josh, I appreciate the way you frame the question. As it relates to the second part of your question, the synergies. A couple of things I would ask you to think about, One is, as you know, the vast majority of employer clients we serve our multinational, even the smallest of employers tend to have a multinational footprint within the global mobile population as we think about it. A significant portion of their individual care still takes place in the United States, whether it is returning to the United States for care or needing high advanced care where people travel in United States and then within that a significant portion of the overall care equation ties not only to medical care but pharmaceutical care, so we see that leverage piece of the equation. Secondly, overtime, we continue to see demand outside the United States with our employer clients of all our pharmacy solutions, the same dialog exists around whole person specifically around stress and depression and coordinated care programs. And then lastly, when you think about the global supplemental benefit business while it might be surprising, some of the informatics we have innovated in the United States around AI predictive indicators, predictive modeling, some of the seeds of that originated from outside the United States where we used the logic in the capabilities. But for our sales process, we took some of that framework in to the United States to leverage in the individual business. So we still continue to see both the attractive growth as Eric articulated and synergies, whether it is a multinational needs, the care delivery or a lot of the Informatics and insights going forward. Josh Raskin : Is it fair to say those businesses are critical to the Cigna enterprise? David Cordani : Josh, I would use the word they are an important part of our portfolio. They are a growing part of our portfolio and they contribute meaningfully to the organization. Josh Raskin : Alright. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with JP Morgan. You may ask your question. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. Wanted to ask about the PBM segment and was pleased to see the improvement, both sequentially and year-over-year that you had talked about an expected. My question was throughout the year there has been a number of adjustments to look at reported growth versus comparable growth, but by our estimates those roughly sort of wash out this quarter. I just want to see if that was. Right. So on a reported EBITDA basis up a little over 4% with the comparable sort of apples-to-apples growth be equivalent to that? Eric Palmer : Gary, it is Eric. As you recall we provided a roll forward of the full-year of Health Services earnings back at our Investor Day and kind of on that basis, the way I would have you think about it would be for the first half of 2019, earnings were down in the mid-single digits on a comparable basis for the first half of 2018. After you make all of the adjustments for re-segmentation and the like, and for the back half of 2019 we expect the earnings to be up in the mid to high single-digits on a comparable basis. But, so if you pull those pieces together and that gets to the result that we have consistently guided to for the segment overall, over the course of the year in which we tightening that this earnings release to $5.075 billion to $5.175 billion. Gary Taylor : Okay, fair enough. So mid-single digit or better, I think would be applicable for this quarter as well. It sounds like, it looks like Eric Palmer : I think that is a fair statement, Gary. Gary Taylor : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Taylor. Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. You may ask your question. Scott Fidel : Thanks, good morning question just on the PDM regulatory front in Washington and it seems like a lot of the momentum has stated a bit since HHS punted on the rebate proposal, so just interested if you can talk about at this point how do you see the PDM legislative and regulatory environment playing out and whether you do expect that there will be any major changes to any of the key PBM market structures in the near-term. David Cordani : Good morning Scott, it is David. I think as we have had the conversation in the past around the regulatory framework tied around PBM or pharmacy more broadly, bring it back to the main point which is affordability the market is speaking better value and a big part of better value is more affordability. We expect to continue to see an evolving regulatory environment, but equally or more important, a more accelerated evolving innovation environment and that is what we are driving towards. So we are pleased that we have continued to deliver an outstanding pharmacy trend, clinical results, et cetera. We are driving innovations that orients around affordability like the patient assurance program that I represented where we kind of lift the financial burden and create predictability for insulin dependent diabetics at $25 for 30 day supply and then new innovations like Embark to step into the high cost gene therapies in the like. So I would bring the conversation back to affordability and it is something that we continue to drive and use innovation toward and we will continue to engage constructively with regulatory bodies around how innovation can to drive better value from a societal standpoint. Scott Fidel : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fidel. Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning wanted to ask about health care services going into 2020. So I appreciate the color on the second half ramp and on the PBM side and you previously said the ramp is being caused by more kind of mid-year changes in contracting, in manufacture rebate negotiation and things like that. So would appear to set up is pretty easy comps going into 2020 meaning you only got about a half-year benefit from those typical negotiations, and I think you have said previously you are going back to a 1.1 convention there. So theoretically you should get normal growth in 2020 on the PBM plus by the annualization of what you did in the back half of this year. Is that a reasonable way to think about it, such that second, that 2020 growth is kind of above typical because of that. Thanks. David Cordani : Justin, good morning. I appreciate the question, a lot of moving parts. Let me start qualitatively and see if Eric wants' to add additionally to the point. First big picture as Eric noted, we are quite pleased with the results we are delivering in 2020 in-line with our expectations an important inflection point for the third quarter as expected. Secondly, as we noted in prepared remarks very attractive growth outlook for next year. Now to the core of your question. Multiple moving parts next year, big picture, earnings will grow next year, scripts will grow next year, revenue will grow next year. The pattern will more normalize as you articulated, because your reference is correct. Our supply chain activities were more front end loaded from actions and therefore a back end loaded this year from contributions, next year that will smooth out. I would ask you to consider a few additional items as well as we move forward through the business cycle our synergies will continue to ramp. As we move forward through our business cycle as well, the stranded overhead will ramp down where our objective is to have all the stranded overhead removed by the end of 2012. Resulting in zero stranded overhead as we step into 2021. So I would ask you to think about those moving parts. The big picture comparator you are using I think is right, but you need to add those additional moving parts of ramping synergies and then ultimately removing all the stranded overhead by the end of 2020. Eric Palmer : Justin, it is Eric. Just one other thing I would add. I would note that we expect that the fourth quarter of 2019 will be the final period where we will report transitioning client as that transition and client activity that activity will wrap up this year. So as we get into 2020 it will just be the Health Services segment that will reflect the dynamics, David just described. Justin Lake : Okay, thanks for all the color. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. You may ask your question. Charles Rhyee : Yes hey, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to go over the 2020 guidance here. And David I appreciate the comments that you made. Does your initial EPS outlook here, just to clarify include benefit of expected to share repurchase next year, obviously you are doing about $2 billion this year, any kind of sense for how much we should expect or you are kind of thinking about in your head in terms of buybacks for next year? David Cordani : Good morning, I appreciate the question. First, as we get through the end of the fiscal year and step through the fourth quarter call, we will look forward to providing additional color relative to 2020, but we are excited with the strength of this year and the ability to have such a strong outlook for next year. Specific to your question, consistently, we do not factor in two items to our forward-looking guidance or projections. First and foremost is what you articulate unless we indicate otherwise, we do not project capital deployment on a go-forward basis, and we will roll and provide that to you from that standpoint. I'm going to ask Eric, to give you a little color on how the cash flow and the capital deployment that we walk through at Investor Day is oriented around 2019, 2020 and then 2021. Secondly, to remind you we also do not project prior year reserve development as part of our outlook from that standpoint. So your logic is correct, those two items would be excluded from anything we articulate on a forward-looking basis and we true that up quarter-to-quarter. Eric, maybe a little color on the cash flow and the capital deployment. Eric Palmer : Charles, it is Eric. We provided some detail back at our Investor Day in terms of the cash flow from operations we expected in 2019, 2020 and 2021. And I would say, we have increased our view on 2019 as I noted in my prepared remarks. 2020 view remains generally consistent, we expect to generate about $7 billion of cash from operations. The bulk of that will go to deleveraging, as I noted again in my prepared remarks that is our top capital deployment priority. We will have some capacity for repurchase and we will provide more color on that as we get into the year. Charles Rhyee : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rhyee. Our next question comes from AJ Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your questions. AJ Rice : Hi everybody, thought I would maybe ask about the government business, which you obviously highlighted again is one of the priorities. You have probably got a sense at this point to be able to look at the open enrollment and where things are and the relative competitive positioning of different offerings. I know at Investor Day, you said long-term, you thought MA would grow 10% to 15% towards the low-end next year. Any updated thoughts on that or the Company's positioning and then is there any update your thinking about Medicaid and where that sits in terms of a priority. David Cordani : Hey, good morning. It is David, your recollection from our Investor Day is correct. Our intermediate to long-term outlook is 10% to 15% customer growth for that business portfolio and at Investor Day we noted as the transition you are going 2020 we expected it to be at the lower end of that range. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we expect at least 10% growth. To the first part of your question, we are quite pleased in terms of the positioning of our offerings in our key markets, both our core offerings meaning individual HMO offerings as well as our new offerings are individual PPO offerings as it relates to the benefit design in the overall price point positioning. Secondly market feedback has been quite positive and third while early, early volume indicators are positive and tracking well from that standpoint. On a final note, as I referenced in my prepared remarks that is also aided by a really strong stars positioning this year and we have visibility to even a further step up from 77% which will carry into 2020, to 85% greater than four in 2021. Differentiated NPS of about 70 on average across our business portfolio, and then our physician relationships that our value based. Specific to Medicaid, as you know from prior conversations, we have historically had a lower level priority on that versus other growth platforms. We continue to believe that over time, as states grapple with both the clinical burden and the health challenges as well as affordability challenges Medicaid programs will continue to evolve. our state sponsored programs will continue to evolve and be sub-segmented in terms of either value based on risk-based high comprehensive programs and we see that as an attractive intermediate term opportunity for the organization, none of that is factored into our current outlook, that is an additional growth platform opportunity for us as we look to the future. AJ Rice : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. You may ask your question. Steven Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good morning, David and Eric thanks for taking my question. So with the strength in health services and you also cited the strong performance in Specialty Pharmacy is one of the key factors that definitely seems to be a theme across a lot of the U.S. pharmaceutical supply channel this year. I guess, I'm just curious if you are strength in specialty pharmacy was driven simply by greater prescription volume and/or the introduction of any particular new specialty drugs, or was your profit strength also maybe partially enhanced by and the economics tied to your ability to control specialty pharmacy spend for your clients. David Cordani : Steve. Good morning. It is David, let me start and I will ask Eric to add. First, we are quite pleased. I think the headline is we are quite pleased with both the positioning, the ongoing innovation, strength of our Credo asset. And just stepping back, putting it into context that business is a trusted pharmacy business as specialty care providers, specialty pharmaceutical manufacturers look to an organization that has the experience of coordinating the complex care and services that are necessary. The clinical programs up to and including 600 home health care professionals that visit our patients and help to coordinate the care and services. And lastly, as you may recall from prior conversations that organization is broken down in excess of 15 subspecialty organizations given the uniqueness of what is there. The growth profile is generated from obviously additional script volume for our - we will call it more captive business but also just organic growth that exists outside of our captive business. Whether it is ESI captive, or Cigna captive business, which is a validation of the quality of services. Additional therapies are coming in-line as well and I will ask Eric to provide a little bit more color on what is driving the growth. Eric Palmer : Maybe just a couple of things I would note Steve, I think that there is growth in terms of the business dynamics David just described as well as all our role in helping to manage our customers and clients costs and we get rewarded for the effective job that we do there as well. Specifically there have been a different drug launches, both in terms of new therapies that have come into the year this year that drive that and this just increasing use of therapies that we provide through credo and alike, so that is been a bit of the driver. And then on top of that is new alternatives like generics for some of the specialty therapies or biosimilars come online, there will be more opportunity for the credo capabilities in the future as well. Steven Valiquette : Okay. I appreciate the color. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our next question comes from Whit Mayo with UBS. You may ask your question. Whit Mayo : Hey, thanks. Express had enterprise wide efficiency program that was underway. I don't know, maybe two years ago I think they size some pretty large numbers as they thought about that program, I think I have 600 million my notes maybe I'm wrong, but is there any update to that program. What you guys have learned or is this all sort of merge together into how Cigna thinks at the enterprise level on the corporate synergies with Express? Thanks. Eric Palmer : Hey Whit it is Eric. Express Scripts announced an initiative back in 2017 aimed at reducing costs and improving efficiency in light of the transition clients and like. That should have continued, and have managed along with our integration and that is working to drive the organization broadly to the improved levels of effectiveness and efficiency. It is been managed in conjunction with our ongoing integration work and so it is again it does continue largely on-track in terms of the major milestones that Express Scripts had outlined to make sure that the costs to support the ongoing business, we are consistent with the expectations and at a really competitive level. Whit Mayo : Okay. So just to be just to be clear, that is a totally separate program than how you frame the G&A related synergies from the transaction? Eric Palmer : Totally separate, it is probably a bit too extreme of a separation, but we do think of EBI as separate from the synergies that are deal related. And so both of those are working to drive costs out of the organization and get us to a really competitive effective and efficient operation. Whit Mayo : Perfect, thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Mayo. Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. You may ask your question. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks, good morning. Just quickly want to go back to the guidance commentary. You are using the 16/40 jumps off point at midpoint of 10% to 13% growth would put us in sort of the $18 to $30 range, I guess, is that a general framework. I know you want to put a spot estimate on it and that is before PYD which I think this year is running just under $0.20 and before any share repos. I just want to clarify those things. And then obviously you have delivered upside to the baseline from when you first put out the $20 to $21 EPS goal for 2021, you noted that range still holds. But is it fair to expect any bias to the upside or a higher end at this point or is it just too early to make that call? Thanks. David Cordani : Good morning. It is David to the first part of your question, big picture, you have it right, the 16/40, we remain committed to the 10% to 13% and your math kind of squares that range from that standpoint and for your comments excludes prior year reserve development, as we always would and/or capital deployment. To the second part of your question, I appreciate your optimism, come back, first and foremost. We are delighted in such a dynamic environment to have put that goal and objective out, which is a significant compounded EPS over a long period of time. Think of jumping out of 2017 after tax reform from an 2018 forward of 2015 mid teens CAGAR over a multi-year period of time. We are delighted with that. I appreciate your notion relative to the range. We will look forward to further updates as we go forward and as Eric and I both noted the visibility we have and the commitment we have to deliver on that $20 to $21. And at least $8.5 billion of cash flow from operations, we are delighted with it at this point in time. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much Operator : Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. I wanted to talk a little bit about the 2020 guidance. I guess the 10% to 13% number in-line with your long-term growth, but I guess when we think about 2020 there is transitioning costs kind of winding down that could add a 1% or 2%. There is the synergies kind of ramping up, which could add 1% or 2% and so the capital deployment kind of seems like a normal year as far as the full-year benefit of what you have done in the year before. So is there a reason to think that the core growth in 2020 might be a little bit lower than average for some reason, I guess just trying to figure out why it is only kind of 13 with standard costs and synergies ramping? David Cordani : Kevin, its David. Pick up on your last phraseology only 13, but appreciate the tone of your question in the framing. So let me step back, if you think about our commitment to our shareholders and we walk through comprehensively at Investor Day the framework. The 10% to 13% essentially orients around 6% to 8% from the organic operations and 4% to 5% from effective capital deployment. If you think about that implied guidance direction that we provided, we are providing the same direction, which means that there is an underlying organic performance of 6$ to 8% within our expectations in the 4% to 5% from capital deployment, given that we have chosen to deploy our capital to effectuate the transformative transaction that 4% to 5% contribution largely comes through the effect of capturing synergies step up next year and the effects of deleveraging, through is some rounding relative to the share repurchase from that standpoint. It is the initial range and direction we are providing and we will look forward to providing additional context as we step through the fourth quarter call. So I think your logic stream is right by attaching the capital deployment. But again, ask you to think about that for 2018 as being driven by the effects of the deleveraging and the effects of the synergy capture, which are a direct result of prior capital deployment. Net, net we are in-line with our long-term sustained results and we will have a full-year track record of delivering that level or greater from that standpoint. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, great, thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fishbeck. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Ricky Goldwasser : Hi, good morning. Just going back to the comment that we made earlier on the call, I think you mentioned that for the fourth quarter is going to be the last one to two going to report transitioning clients. We were under the impression that the last wave of off boarding is going to happen in January. So, are you seeing the business transitioning faster and on the flip side maybe if you could give us an update on your expected cadence of the Cigna's script in-sourcing back into Express? Eric Palmer : Ricky its Eric. So, on the transition in clients on the transition. We would expect that to ramp up at the end of the year at this point. So you heard me correctly that the fourth quarter will be the last period that we would expect to report that as a separate item. So we would expect the transition out to be wrapped up at the end of the year here. As it relates to the transition in and moving to the Express platform, really no update here in terms of the specifics. Much earlier this year, we announced that we had reached an agreement on the transition agreement associated with the services that they were fulfilling for the Cigna pharmacy that transition began in July. David noted in his prepared remarks are underway now. We would expect that the full-annualized benefit of that being on the Express platform will come through by the end of 2020. But we haven't broken out any further detail in terms of the specific cadence there. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay, if I could. I have one quick follow-up just on the MCR range for the fourth quarter, it seems that the range is quite wide about 160 bps between low to high when we think what do you see kind of like that that the swing factor there? Eric Palmer : Ricky. Nothing I would call out unusual there. I think it would be just the normal kind of waiting pace of claims cost and how they come in. Overall, we tightened the range for the full-year, we had a good track record here and driving to a really attractive loss ratios, so again nothing that I would call out is anything beyond the normal items that could drive variability up or down in the in the quarter. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Goldwasser. Our next question comes from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Steve Tanal : Morning, guys, thanks for the color. Covered a lot of ground but I guess I just want to clarify the discussion around the 2020 outlook. So does it exclude future capital deployment specifically thinking about any additional debt pay down in 2020? I think the ratable portion of the two year deleveraging for the Investor Day, that is about $0.30, so is that sort of specifically in the numbers you shared this morning. And then wanted to also just confirm the step up in synergies, is that still kind of consistent with the initial outlook, I think you guys laid out like $273 million pre-tax step up back in May of 2018. So is that being contemplated as well fully? Eric Palmer : Steve, it is Eric. A couple of different dynamics there. So first of all just to be clear, the figures David talked about for 2020 excludes any future share repurchase, but includes the other operations that we would expect in terms of the effect of what we have done this year, the rate and pace of our deleveraging, et cetera, but it excludes any future share repurchase or any other acquisitions or things along those lines on that base. So that is the dynamic. In terms of the second part of your question. On the synergy components broadly we are on-track for the synergy path that we have talked about, the $600 million that we have outlined over the course of the first four years, we continue to execute against that and continue to see those as reasonable markers in terms of the gold that we will achieve, the rate and pace of investments and such will always vary as we manage the business, but again at the macro level Steve would be on-track for that. Steve Tanal : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Tanal. The next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question. Lance Wilkes : Yes, good morning. So, as you are looking at 2020 and thinking a little bit about integrated medical, what are you kind of presuming as far as member growth within the commercial segment? Importantly, as you are looking at selective - you see 2020 is being another year, where you will have a lot of risk growth or do you see 2020 may be reverting more towards self-insured growth. Thanks. David Cordani : Lance, it is David, good morning. So within the integrated medical business as I noted my prepared remarks, 2018 was our 10th consecutive year of organic growth. The growth as you articulate you referenced one of the driving forces there, sustain attractive growth in the select segment, we continue to see sustained attractive growth in the middle market segment for overall portfolio. Stepping in 2020, we would expect that to continue. The mixes of funding mechanisms as you know, but just to remind the audience, we continue to offer a diverse portfolio of funding options to our clients and we see variability in any given point in time in terms of the clients opt for more guaranteed cost, more shared funding or shared returns or more ASO or ASO stop loss and we see that Flex overtime. In 2018 we saw a bit more of the guaranteed cost of phenomenon play through and we are very comfortable with that also to remind you that our overall earnings profile per customer is similar between guaranteed cost and self-funded because of the nature of our portfolio of businesses from that standpoint. So stay tuned for more for 2020. I think the headline is continued growth, continued trends in the select segment, continued strength in the middle market segment. Lance Wilkes : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Wilkes. Our next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question. Dave Styblo : Hi there, it is Dave Styblo on for Windley, and thanks for the questions. Just to stick on the enrollment. I think for the rest of you guys are looking to add on about another 90,000 lives in the fourth quarter to reach our target, curious how much visibility do you have on that? How much of that is already in-hand and then thinking about this year, I know it is a little bit lower than what you originally expected. I think that was largely due to fewer RFPs are out in the market. It wasn't a retention issue. So I'm curious is that more of a delay in push out of those RFPs coming to market and we might see more of that activity next year? Eric Palmer : Dave, it is Eric, I will start. As it relates to the growth over the balance of the year, couple of things I would note. First we are up over 200,000 customers now versus where we were at the end of third quarter 2018. So to accomplish our full-year goal, we just need to keep the same pace as what we delivered in 2018. As you might know, in the Select segment, the lower end of the middle market segment that is really a year round selling cycle. I mean, so we would expect opportunity to drive to and through our goal over the course of the fourth quarter here, just by executing in the same way that we have over the last number of years. So I think about that as having good visibility in terms of trajectory and such there. David, I don\u2019t know if you want to provide some additional commentary more broadly on the selling seasons. David Cordani : To your thought process, first you are correct. Retention remained strong across the portfolio for 2019. We saw a little lower performance within our national commercial employer segment. Think about those as commercial employers a 5,000 or more employees that are multistate and a little low performance at the higher end of the middle market range. So the largest within the middle market, in aggregate still continue to grow. Also remind you that as we get to those largest clients, they tend to be the less penetrated or a lower level of specialty penetration in terms of the profile, as such you see, even though the medical customer growth came down a tad this year, earnings strength remains from that standpoint. And then we should expect that same trend to continue into 2020, we expect 2020 to be another strong retention year, strong growth in the select segment in the core of the middle market with varied performance at the highest end where there is thinner penetration. Dave Styblo : Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Windley. Our next question comes from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Matthew Borsch : Hi. Maybe you could just talk about the commercial market in terms of what you see employers interested in terms of product changes for 2020 at this stage. Correct me if I'm wrong, there seem to be a little bit of a slowdown in the pace of cost shifting or if you want to put it differently, adoption of high-deductible health plan products, is that something that you have seen, are continuing to see and if so what our employers doing instead? David Cordani : Matthew good morning its David. At the broader sense, consistent a prior comment. Employers are seeking two fundamental needs, improved affordability to create the balance and sustainability of the programs that generates improved health and productivity present to you as an engagement of the co-workers. So they are working with all the levers to drive that. To a statement you made and I think a little bit more broadly from CDHP, it depends on where the employer is in their cost-sharing arrangement, but for some employers they have concluded that they pushed, I would say to the outer limits of cost sharing and some employers are actually stepping back from that a little changing their contribution strategies by wage level to try to get the alignment with the employees as a percent of the discretionary income as opposed to a flat percentage. Third, I would suggest that employers are much more actively engaged in programs around what we call whole person health putting the mind, body together taking depression stress management behavioral services and driving them more integrated in because the data would show that there high corollary to not only medical issues, but productivity present here and then overall sustainability from that standpoint. And then open to more innovation relative to care delivery mechanism. So the interest in virtual care delivery to get more personalization efficiency and affordability, as well as extending the care equation, whether it is through the employer of the home or otherwise, those trends continue. So, you are theme is on absolutely, but it varies by employer and it varies by lever they are seeking to push and our portfolio of assets lines up very well to that need set. Matthew Borsch : Great. Thank you for all that. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. George Hill : Good morning, guys and I appreciate you taking the question. Kind of back on the pharmacy side brand drug pricing has been pretty strong in 2019, I guess, could you talk about the Company's expectations for 2020 as it relates to drug pricing? And maybe if you can provide a little color around if it comes in kind of very low single-digits, is there an impact on like rebates and profitability in PBM? Thank you. David Cordani : George, good morning, it is David. First and foremost, broadly speaking, we continue to be very pleased with the pharmacy trend or the overall result we are delivering for our clients and customers and continue to build off the strength there both in the core pharmacy operations as well as a very important in specialty pharmacy operations. At this point we are not providing detailed guidance as it relates to underlying pricing trend or brand trend or otherwise from that standpoint. We will challenge ourselves to provide additional visibility as we get into the fourth quarter call in more detail outlook from that standpoint. But I think the most important part of the answer is that we are confident we are going to grow our health services portfolio, revenue, scripts and earnings next year. We feel very positive about our ability to deliver differentiated trend, clinical performance and service results next year and manage the dynamics of the inflationary environment and the mix of inflationary environment between generic brand and specialty pharmaceuticals. And we will look forward to trying to provide more guidance as we step into 2020. George Hill : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Hill. Our final question comes from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Frank Morgan : Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered. So these will be very random just the first one. Any color on the upcoming post-trial brief hearing on the break-up fee. I think that is it for some time in November. Maybe the date there and any expectations there, any commentary around the Texas Medicaid results that came out yesterday, and I think those are my two random questions. Thanks. David Cordani : It is David, I will take granular question. One, on litigation and I will ask Eric to take out random question number two on Medicaid. Specifically your dates are correct, the final trial is slated for later in the month of November. We continue to feel very strongly about our case and look forward to a successful resolution from that outcome and to remind you we have nothing factored into our capital outlook relative to our recovery of that break fee. Eric, I will ask you to address Medicaid Eric Palmer : Yes Frank it is Eric. On Texas Medicaid, just a couple of things to put out there for you. First of all, you are correct, we received notice earlier this week that our role in that contract will wind down next year. Just to put it in context, it represents about $900 million of revenue, but really a de-minims contribution to earnings. The timeframe in 2020 means I will have order of magnitude maybe a $300 million earnings decline year-on-year and less than a penny. I'm sorry, $300 million of revenue decline in the year and like less than a penny of earnings per share. So very immaterial. We are reviewing our options related to the potential to protest and haven't made a decision on that at this point, but very manageable under the scheme of things overall. Frank Morgan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Mr. Morgan. At this time, I will turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : Thank you. Just to briefly wrap up our call, I would like to highlight some key points for today. We are very pleased with our third quarter results, which reflects continued momentum across our businesses, including earnings growth for Health Services and Integrated Medical business and strong retention of expansion of our customer relationships, as well as significant ongoing operating cash flow generation and capital deployment. Relative to our combination with Express Scripts, we continue to make very good progress and we are delivering a number of meaningful benefits for our customers, patients, clients and shareholders. Looking ahead to our initial outlook for 2020, we expect attractive EPS growth next year and expect to grow earnings per share 10% to 13% in-line with our long-term EPS growth expectations. And for 2021, we remain on-track to deliver our $20, $21 EPS goal as well as cash flow from operations of at least $8.5 billion. We thank you for joining our call today and look forward to our future discussions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's third Quarter 2019 results review.

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter queue to ask question at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen this conference including the Q&A session is being recorded. We will begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell. William McDowell : Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining today's call. I\u2019m Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics including Cigna's full year 2019 financial results, as well as our financial outlook for 2020. As noted in our earnings release when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues which are not determined in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income, and total revenues respectively is contained in today's earnings release which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled Adjusted Income from Operations and Earnings per Share on this same basis as our principle measures of financial performance. I will remind you that as previously disclosed we exclude contributions from transitioning clients from adjusted income from operations, and adjusted revenue. In our remarks today, we will be making some Forward-Looking Statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2020 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the fourth quarter we recorded an after tax special item charge of $116 million or $0.31 per share for integration and transaction related costs. We also recorded a special item charge of $162 million or $0.43 per share, for severance cost associated with a series of actions we're taking to improve our organizational efficiency. As described in today\u2019s earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations, in our discussion of financial results. Please note that consistent with best practice, when we make prospective comments, regarding financial performance, including our full-year 2020 outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future share repurchases or additional prior year development of medical costs. Additionally, our outlook for 2020 assumes a full year of earnings from Cigna's group disability and life business. We continue to expect our divestiture of that business to be completed by the third quarter of 2020. I will remind you that as previously disclosed beginning in 2020, we will no longer exclude contributions from transitioning clients from our performance measures as the transition for those clients was substantially complete as of December 31, 2019. And finally, I will note that this morning, we posted investor presentation to the investor relations section of cigna.com that outlines our strategy and track record, the strength of our four growth platforms, 2020 operating and capital guidance and details of our longer term outlook. We hope that you will find this a helpful resource. With that, I will turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks Will and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. In 2019, we delivered consolidated adjusted revenue of $140 billion and grew earnings per share by 20% to $17.05. As a result, we exceeded the guidance that we'd already raised each quarter during 2019 for revenue, earnings and EPS as well as cash flow from operations. Today I'll comment on how we delivered these exceptionally strong results and on the contributions made by each of our four growth platforms led by Health Services and Integrated Medical segments. I'll also discuss how we are positioned to drive attractive growth in 2020 and achieve our 2021 EPS target of $20 to $21 per share. Finally, I'll highlight a key point of differentiation and a driver of future growth, our focus on being the undisputed partner of choice in health care. Following my comments, Eric will share more details about our full year 2019 financial results and 2020 outlook, and then we'll take your questions. Let's dive in. At our Investor Day last year, we committed to building on a decade long track record of delivering industry leading cost trends, consistent growth, and effective capital stewardship. In 2019, we delivered on each of these commitments. While remaining focused on our customers and patients, we executed well across each of our businesses, deepened our customer relationships and achieved our integration priorities. Together this fueled our outstanding performance. In Health Services, we delivered market leading customer and client retention including 97% retention for the 2020 selling season and continued strong organic growth in prescriptions. In commercial, we again delivered industry leading medical cost trend and grew our commercial medical customers for the 10th consecutive year, led by another year of double digit growth in the select segment. And in a government business, CMSs most recent stared ratings position as to have 87% of our Medicare Advantage customers enforced our higher plan for 2021 a reinforcement of our strong customer satisfaction and high levels of clinical quality. Additionally, we made significant progress in advancing our five key integration priorities. First and foremost, we kept that promises in the marketplace by ensuring our more than 170 million customer relationships around the world experienced ongoing high service quality throughout the year. Second, we delivered medical and pharmacy cost savings for the benefit of our customers and clients, effectively completing their transition to industry leading pharmacies solutions, including Accredo's specialty pharmacy, and Express Scripts customer friendly home delivery pharmacy. Additionally, more than 95% of our customers have access to safeguard Rx, an innovative suite of value based programs that improve care and value for customers with challenging medical conditions. Third was a focus on talent. As a Health Service company, our talent and their engagement is key to our performance and ongoing growth. Our retention and engagement levels today, one year into a combination are above our already strong pre-transaction levels. Fourth, we made significant progress towards securing base operating expense synergies. The organizational efficiency plan we announced earlier today is another important step toward achieving these targets. And finally, we kept our vision top of mind by accelerating marketplace innovations that improve affordability, predictability and simplicity, including our embark benefit protection program, which improves customer access to life changing gene therapies, while shielding clients from the price shock of multimillion dollar treatments. Our digital health formulary, to better carry and generate value from the 300,000 digital health apps in the marketplace today in a patient assurance program, where insulin dependent patients with diabetes pay a maximum of $25 for a 30 day supply of insulin. As a result of this program, our customers are already realizing significant out of pocket savings. Overall, 2019 was an exceptionally strong year for Cigna and gives us considerable momentum for ongoing attractive growth in 2020 and beyond. Our achievements were and continue to be driven by the focus, commitment and passion of our employees who wake up every day to fulfill our mission to improve the health well-being peace of mind to those we serve. In 2020 we will continue to drive significant growth and customer relationships, revenue, earnings and EPS as well as strong cash flows. In Health Services, we expect adjusted script growth in a range of 20% to 23% over our year end 2019 levels. In integrated medical, we are on track for continued medical customer growth highlighted by our government business, where we expect 13% to 16% customer growth and Medicare Advantage and we remain positioned for very attractive growth over the next five years. Additionally, after a very successful first year as a combined company, we remain on track to complete our integration activities over the next year. We also expect to close the sale of our group disability and life business to New York Life by the third quarter this year. And we're on track to return a balance sheet to normalized levels of debt by year end 2020. In short, we're on pace to meet the commitments we made when we announced the combination nearly two years ago, and meet the commitments we made at our Investor Day in May of 2019. Looking forward a key point of differentiation and growth driver for Cigna in 2020 and beyond is our orientation toward partnering in order to achieve accelerated innovation, improved affordability, predictability and simplicity and to further expand our distribution reach. Several recent examples demonstrate our proven differentiation. First is our new arrangement with Prime Therapeutics. Starting in April 2020, together we will make pharmacy care more affordable, financing, pharmacy networks and pharmaceutical manufacturer value for Prime's 28 million members who are covered by 23 health plans including employer programs, Medicare and Medicaid. Together Express Scripts and Prime will help each other to continue to grow in the market across the country by innovating new solutions to improve affordability, increased access to medicine and further improve individual health. This agreement shows our ability to work across healthcare and partner with those who seek to deliver innovative high quality health services and solutions to employers, health plans and governmental agencies for the benefit of customers and patients. A second example of our partnership orientation is our work with emerging and highly innovative companies. A great recent example of this is a partnership with Oscar Health. With Oscar, we will deliver new innovative solutions for small businesses, which all too often are left with limited options that are highly priced. We will offer small businesses access to affordable, fully insured health plans that brought in choice and prioritize whole person health. We will focus in four geographies with Oscar later this year and we'll take our proven tessellated framework to accelerated growth over time. A third example is our trusted relationships with healthcare professionals. We have a long history innovative value based arrangements with healthcare professionals in both our US commercial and government businesses, including more than 650 collaborative accountable care relationships. Today, more than 65% of Cigna's medical payments are in value based arrangements across our top 40 commercial markets and all our Medicare markets. Importantly, 92% of healthcare providers in our programs are delivering differentiated levels of quality. And 90% of healthcare providers believe Cigna is the industry leader in this area. These deep partnerships drive our growth, particularly in Medicare Advantage where we focus on geographies, where our commercial business already has aligned high performing collaborative accountable care relationships in place. Approximately 25% of Medicare eligible seniors live in geographies where commercial business has deep ties in delivery systems, but we have no Medicare Advantage presence today. That provides a meaningful growth opportunity for our Medicare Advantage business that we have begun to capitalize in 2020 by accelerating our geographic expansion and bringing new PPO solutions to market. This combined with the fact that 87% of our Medicare Advantage customers are in four star or greater plans in 2021 and our high customer and PS levels, which approximate 70 across all of our markets, make us excited about our future customer growth, which we project to be in the range of 10% to 15% on an annualized basis over the next five years. Each of these examples gives a clear view of how diverse healthcare stakeholders view Cigna as their best partner for future success and how being the partner of choice in healthcare marketplace will contribute to our sustained differentiated growth over time. Now briefly, to summarize, at Cigna we delivered exceptional full year 2019 financial results across our four growth platforms led by Health Services and our Integrated Medical segments. These results drove strong financial performance in 2018 and provide us with considerable momentum as we step into 2020 with outstanding strategic and financial flexibility, and we remain on track to deliver our EPS goal of $20 to $21 per share in 2021. With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric. Eric Palmer : Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll review Cigna's 2019 results and provide our outlook for 2020. Key consolidated financial highlights for 2019 include adjusted revenue of $140 billion, earnings of $6.5 billion after tax, earnings per share growth of 20% to $17.05 and operating cash flows more than doubled this year to $9.5 billion. These results reflect strong consistent execution across our businesses throughout 2019. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Health Services. Full year 2019 revenues were $96.4 billion and pre-tax earnings were $5.1 billion. Results for 2019 reflect organic growth, with outstanding client retention and the addition of 2.7 million pharmacy customers, strong volumes with 1.22 billion adjusted pharmacy scripts fulfilled and growth in specialty pharmacy. Overall, Health Services performed well in 2019 with results in line with our expectations and reflecting significant progress across our integration activities. Turning to Integrated Medical, 2019 revenues grew 11% to $36.5 billion driven by commercial customer growth and expansion of specialty relationships, premium growth reflecting underlying cost trends, and the inclusion of the Express Scripts Medicare Part D business. We organically grew our global medical customer base to 17.1 million lives. In 2019, we once again delivered double digit organic customer growth in our select segment with continued enrollment gains in middle market. Full year earnings grew 9% to $3.8 billion reflecting growth in medical customers and specialty relationships, strong operating expense discipline, and continued effective medical cost management. Turning to medical cost, for our total US commercial book of business, full year medical cost trend for 2019 was approximately 4%, which marks the seventh consecutive year Cigna has delivered an industry leading result. Our full year 2019 total medical care ratio or MCR was 80.8%, finishing the year at the low end of our guidance range. Our MCR performance reflects stable trends and focused execution of affordability initiatives across our commercial and government businesses and the pricing effect of the health insurance tax suspension. Full year 2019, Integrated medical earning benefited from $85 million pre-tax of favorable net to prior year reserve development. Overall, Cigna's Integrated Medical segment delivered strong financial results in 2019. In our international markets business, revenues grew to $5.6 billion, an increase of 8% on a currency adjusted basis. And full year 2019 pre-tax earnings grew to $762 million reflecting continued business growth, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts. For our group disability and other operations segments, full year 2019 revenues were $5.2 billion. Full year pre-tax earnings for this segment were $501 million with strong performance in life and continued administrative efficiencies, partially offset by higher disability claims. For our corporate segment, the full year 2019 loss was $1.8 billion, primarily driven by $1.7 billion of interest costs. As Will mentioned, during fourth quarter, we reported a special item charge of $162 million after tax for severance costs related to our organizational efficiency plan. Under this plan, we will implement efficiency initiatives that we identified primarily through our integration work. These actions reflect our commitment to providing affordable quality solutions to the marketplace and the savings associated with this plan are included within the multi-year administrative expense synergy targets that we previously communicated. Overall, Cigna's 2019 results reflect focused execution across each of our businesses. Before discussing our outlook for continued attractive growth this year, I would remind you of the 2019 earnings per share baseline adjustments that we quantified on our third quarter earnings call. Specifically, Cigna's earnings per share performance in 2019 should be adjusted for the following three items. First, $0.12 share for the tax item we've favorably settled in the second quarter of 2019. Second, $0.18 per share of favorable net prior year reserve development. And finally, $0.25 per share associated with the industry tax, which was suspended for 2019, but returns in 2020 a final year. This impact is increased to reflect the incremental timing effect of the recent repeal of the industry tax. When adjusting for these impacts, Cigna's 2019 earnings per share baseline was $16.50. Turning to outlook, we have entered 2020 well positioned to drive both continued growth and innovation. We also expect to complete our integration activities associated with the Express Scripts combination over the next year. For full year 2020, we expect consolidate adjusted revenues in the range of $154 million to $156 billion, representing growth of 10% to 11%. We expect full year 2020 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be $6.8 billion to $7 billion or $18 to $18.60 per share. This represents growth in the range of 9% to 13% over our 2019 baseline. We expect the cadence of earnings per share 2020 to be approximately 47% in the first half and 53% in the second half of the year, taking into consideration seasonality patterns within our businesses. For 2020, we project an expense ratio in the range of 8.6% to 9.1%, and the consolidated adjusted tax rates in the range of 23% to 24%. Additionally, our outlook excludes any contribution from future share repurchases, and prior year reserve development and assumes a full year of contributions from our group disability and life business. And as previously communicated in 2020, we will no longer report transitioning client contributions since those transitions were substantially complete as of December 31, 2019. I will now discuss our 2020 outlook for our segments. For our Health Services business we expect full year 2020 earnings in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.45 billion. This represents year-over-year growth in the range of 4% to 7%. In Health Services, we expect first quarter 2020 earnings to grow by a mid-single digit percentage over first quarter 2019. This outlook reflects solid underlying growth and the benefits of increased year-over-year administrative expense synergies. I'd also note that we expect our first quarter 2020 Health Services SG&A expense ratio to be higher than first quarter 2019 reflecting impacts of the client transitions we've discussed previously and including startup costs associated with our collaboration with Prime Therapeutics. For 2020 we expect adjusted pharmacy scripts in the range of 1.47 billion to 1.50 billion claims. This reflects the impact of completing the in sourcing of Cigna pharmacy services, growth associated with the first year of the Prime collaboration and additional organic growth of 25 million to 35 million adjusted pharmacy scripts. All in this represents a year-over-year growth of 20% to 23%. For integrated medical, we expect full year 2020 earnings in the range of $4 billion to $4.1 billion, which represents growth of 11% to 13% over the 2019 baseline. This outlook reflects strength and growth in our businesses, driven by continued benefits from organic customer growth, deepening of customer relationships and effective medical cost management. This outlook also included the benefit of administrative expense synergies. Key assumptions reflected in our Integrated Medical earnings outlook for 2020 include the following, regarding global medical customers, we expect 2020 growth in the range of 150,000 to 250,000 customers, driven by continued organic growth in our commercial business, led by the selected middle market segments, partially offset by lower national accounts enrollment. We also expect Medicare Advantage customer growth of 13% to 16%. Our growth outlook also includes an expectation of lower enrollment in our US individual business, and the expected loss of our Texas Medicaid contracts collectively resulting in a reduction of approximately 90,000 customers. Turning to medical costs, for our US commercial employer book of business, we expect full year 2020 medical cost trend to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. We expect the 2020 medical care ratio to be in the range of 80.2% to 81.2%, reflecting the return of the health insurance tax in 2020, and continued strong performance of our commercial and government businesses, offset by the mix impact of new Medicare Advantage life and normalized margins in our US individual business. We also expect strong contributions from our international markets with disability and other businesses as they continue to deliver solutions that enhance affordability and predictability and provide a more simplified experience for those we serve. Regarding interest expense, we expect costs of approximately $1.6 billion pre-tax in 2020. So all in for full year 2020, we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $6.8 billion to $7 billion or $18 to $18.60 per share. I would also remind you that our outlook excludes the impact of future share purchases and prior years of development, and assumes a full year of contributions from our group disability and life business. Overall, these expected results represent a very attractive outlook, aided by the strong performance across our differentiated portfolio of businesses. These expected results also position us well to achieve our 2021 earnings per share target of $20 to $21 per share. Now, moving to our capital management position and outlook, our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and we expect them to continue to drive exceptional cash flow with strong returns on capital even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. In 2019, we deployed $5.2 billion to repay debt, and we repurchased 11.8 million shares of stock for $2 billion. We ended 2019 with a debt to capitalization ratio of 45.2% an improvement of 570 basis points over a year and 2018. For 2020, we expect greater than $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well performing businesses. As previously discussed, with a near term focus on accelerated debt repayment and remain on track to return our debt to capitalization ratio to the upper 30s by the end of 2020. In 2020, we expect to deploy $4.5 to $5 billion to debt repayment, and $1 billion to capital expenditures. As a reminder, our capital priorities remain as follows. Reinvestment back into our businesses to drive further innovation and growth, strategic M&A on a targeted basis and returning capital to shareholders, which historically we have done primarily through share repurchase. Year-to-date, as of February 5, 2020, we've repurchased 1.2 million shares for $245 million and we have $3.72 billion of remaining share repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet and cash flow look remain strong, benefiting from a highly efficient service based orientation to drive strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. Now, to recap, our full year 2019 consolidated results reflects considerable strength and momentum across our four growth platforms and continued effective execution of our focus strategy. We are confident in our ability to deliver our full year 2020 earnings outlook. We will remain on track to achieve our $20 to $21 earnings per share target for 2021. Further, our clear strategic focus, differentiated value proposition across our businesses and outstanding financial flexibility give us continued confidence in our long-term targets for growth in revenue, earnings and EPS. With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Mr. Lake, your line is open. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask a quick numbers question and then a little bit about the capital deployment. So first, just in terms of the group disability sale on numbers. I know you have it in there. Just want to understand how you keep \u2013 you deploy capital that you receive to keep this earnings neutral for 2020. Wouldn't the company have to begin buying back stock early or doing ASR given the earnings of go away at a moment in time, and yet the share \u2013 the capital deployment might take time. Eric Palmer : Justin it's Eric, thanks for the question on that. So just to step back, so for the group disability and life transaction, as we noted, in December, we entered into that agreement, we expect $5.3 billion of after tax proceeds, and we're on track for that to close in the third quarter. Since the $5.3 billion first will be incremental to operating cash flow for the year. We've got flexibility in terms of the timing of how we deploy things and how we deploy capital for the year. Our primary focus is on achieving our debt to capitalization ratio of below 40% by the end of the year and we've got flexibility beyond that and throughout the year to begin to what to do share repurchase and such. We haven't provided any specific guidance in terms of the exact timing of the share repurchase, but we do have flexibility to get started on that even as advanced with the close. Justin Lake : Okay, but will it be earnings neutral through the year, the combination of anything to disability and the capital deployment? Eric Palmer : That's our expectation, and that's the guidance that we provided back when we announced the transaction. Justin Lake : Okay, and then if I could just ask a question about the Prime relationship. Congratulations on that obviously. Wanted to understand two things, one, in terms of the relationship itself, it's somewhat narrow in focus, but sounds like it could expand over time. How do you kind of look at the risk versus opportunity to risk being that some of your existing Express Scripts customers we have a much broader relationship, move to Prime and therefore could be somewhat dilutive versus the opportunities to work with these blues and potentially expand that partnership and kind of offset some of that risk. David Cordani : Justin, good morning, it's David. First and foremost, let me just re-underscore how pleased we are to have entered that relationship. The validation of our deep commitment to servicing health plans, partnering with health plans and growing those relationships. Two, your ability to retain any relationship be a commercial health one otherwise is based on a couple of basic tenets. A, are we able to drive partnership and alignment; B, deliver differentiated value; C, innovate together? We're committed to doing so. And actually we view the opposite of the maybe risk that you identified. This further broadens our reach and our opportunity to serve more lives, both individual customers and patients and a broader portfolio of health plans as we go forward. So we're delighted by securing this and we look forward to beginning to serve that relationship in the second quarter of this year. Justin Lake : Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you for the question. Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open, sir. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, great. Thanks. Actually it's a quick numbers question. First two, it sounds like you're saying that the guidance basically is similar to what you were saying with Q3, but you've got another $0.05 drag from this being removed in 2021. Do I just have that right that that's the main change versus Q3 initial outlook? Eric Palmer : Kevin its Eric, really two small things to think about there, the incremental drag of a few cents that you noted and we have the benefit of a few cents\u2019 pickup because of the lower share count as we completed repurchase from the time period. Those are the two differences. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, and then the question being, I think that when you guys provided initial membership guidance at the beginning of this year, that was kind of a little bit disappointing. And I guess it's clear now that some of its individual, some of its Medicaid, but you in your presentation have long-term commercial top line growth of 8% to 10%, which is a higher number than I think most people think about as far as commercial growth. How much of that is able to be driven by just growth in the selected middle market accounts? Or do you need to be starting to grow national accounts and individual to kind of achieve that over the long term? And how do you \u2013 if so, how do you turn that around? Eric Palmer : Kevin its Eric, I'll start on that. First of all, those targets are very consistent with the results we've driven in the commercial markets for a number of years now. And I think the growth in that \u2013 the brinks that we target in that business is being driven by really three things. The first category would be around continued customer growth as we continue to grow in the select middle market segments. We've got a lot of opportunity to continue to grow in those segments. The next one, I'd say would be on deepening our existing client\u2019s relationships. So as we work to identify new solutions and deepen our existing solutions in terms of new product sales and again other programs and services. And then the third category I think about would be around, working to innovate and to deliver new solutions more broadly. But again, that's the recipe that we've used for a number of years now. And we see a lot of opportunity to continue on that track in the commercial market. Kevin Fischbeck : And you don't need massive account growth per se together or is that part of the growth platform? David Cordani : Kevin its David, when you think about national accounts, put it back in context, we defined that segment to remind you much more narrow than maybe the market in total. So for Integrated Medical, its commercial employers, 5000 or more employees that are multi-state. Based on that definition and our strategy we view that marketplace as a flat to somewhat shrinking marketplace based on our strategy within Integrated Medical. Now, Eric's point two and point three reinforce how we continue to actually grow and deepen relationships with national accounts. Even today, we're able to successfully do that. And then lastly, we're quite excited about is adding to that more broadly off of our Health Services platform, the ability to offer broader coordinated services. So we could see deepening of relationships and broadening of relationships with the national accounts, even with the medical membership performance that you're making reference to. And over time, we see the ability to even further accelerate that by leveraging our Health Services portfolio. So that will be a net contributor as well. Operator : Thank you for your question. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Your line is open, sir. Mr. Windley, are you perhaps on mute? Dave Windley : Sorry. Thank you. I was on mute. Sorry about that. Thanks for taking my question on Medicare Advantage. As you look at double digit growth trajectory here and I think that's your expectation for multiple years. That larger cohorts can sometimes come in and put a little pressure on margin. I'm wondering what your expectations are around that and what kind of platform and resources you have in place to onboard risk or risk assess and get new Medicare Advantage members into programs to mitigate any initial margin pressure. David Cordani : Good morning, it's David. First and foremost, we're really pleased with the start to 2020. As we indicated in 2019, we expect to grow this platform 10% to 15% and we're on track to do 13 to 16. Just back to remind me of some of the context we're well positioned today in 2021. Our Stars rating picks up yet further to 87% of our lives enforced are greater plans. And our net promoter score is tracking yet tad over 70 across our broad portfolio. So our ability to grow both in markets on platforms, net new geographies being adjacent counties and new markets are opening and broadening our PPO platform will feel this and drive it on a go forward basis. Clearly the rate and pace of that growth may put a little margin pressure and draw us toward the low end of our margin range or at times, maybe a tad below that. We'll balance that in our portfolios. We continue to invest as we are today. But we like the growth outlook, we like to aggregate margin profile and we like to sustainability. The last sub note maybe have there in terms of the coding and otherwise, our value based provider relationships and our high engagement programs are well positioned to coordinate the care of the services et cetera as reinforced by the stars rating and as reinforced by our overall performance. So we feel good about the outlook for this year and the trajectory going forward. Dave Windley : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir. Steve Tanal : So I guess one on Oscar. This sounds like a very interesting partnership, but trying to understand what elements of their business are difficult or costly for Cigna to build their offer independently. So just trying to really understand what are the functions each of the companies will do in the context of the partnership. And maybe that's it for me. David Cordani : Steve thanks, it's David. So stepping back, as I noted in my prepared remarks. First, at a philosophical level, we view that the notion of partnering and beyond partnering, striving to be the undisputed partner choice is a competitive advantage and something we want to build on. Why? It accelerates pace of innovation, it accelerates value creation, whether it be around affordability, predictability, simplicity, it could broaden speed and absolute reach within the marketplace. Oscar is a wonderful example of that. And if you take it up to the macro level, you'll recall that Cigna has historically not participated in the smallest end of the employer marketplace, be it under 50 or under 100, depending on where the regulatory lines are drawn from that standpoint. Two, we believe that's an underserved marketplace with less choice and less leverage of some of the most innovative solutions, not at the core of your question. When you're open minded to partnering, you could have both focused and acceleration in this case by leveraging Oscar's phenomenal technological infrastructure, digital first infrastructure and information flow infrastructure, which is similar to our philosophy, but we just apply it up market and select the middle and national. And this is a case where we're philosophically aligned, but the durable infrastructure is there to serve the unique needs of the small employers and then we're able to port over our value based network configurations, our high performing engagement, clinical behavioral pharmacy capabilities to make one plus one equal a lot more than two. So we're excited about that. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're staged to open up four markets to the latter part of this year, and then fuel some growth. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from AJ Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open, sir. AJ Rice : Hi, everybody, just maybe ask about the 2020 bottom on and 2021 bottom line ranges that you have, two parts to it. First, Eric made some comments about divisional level seasonality this year and how we might think about that. I know some of your peers have made a bigger deal about the first quarter and the impact of Leap Year, perhaps because your businesses diversified. It doesn't mean as much to you, but is there anything you'd like to say about the seasonal pattern relative to a normal year? And when you think about the range itself, I guess my question is, there's a number \u2013 you got a number of business lines, you got variability around your capital deployment and cost synergy realization. Is that \u2013 is there a couple of things in that range that you see is standing out that would particularly move you either to the high end or the low end of your forecasts, given its $0.60 range and $1 range for this year and next? Or is it just the agglomeration of all these different business lines and it falls out. But I guess I'm just trying to figure out of there a couple things that are big variables in your mind as to where you're going to be say versus the $20 to $21 next year. Eric Palmer : Eric. On the item related to the Leap Year and the February having an extra day this year that doesn't move the pattern around a little bit in the Integrated Medical segment, all else equal, that runs the loss ratio up a little bit for the first quarter, it'll normalize out over the course of the year, of course, fully factored into our guidance and such, but that does put a modest amount of pressure on the first quarter that will recover over the balance of the year. Nothing that I would call out is particularly significant. As it relates to the range more broadly, there aren't any big items I'd call out other than just the rate and pace of our spending and our investments in terms of future growth. As you know, we have continued to invest in building the capabilities in the like and spend every year as we get ready for new clients to come on board and things along those lines, so it would be those types of items that I think about more than anything else at this point. AJ Rice : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open, sir. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks, good morning. I want to go to interest expense guidance, so it looks like your run rating to 1.6 billion at least as of the fourth quarter. The guidance calls for 1.6 billion of interest costs in 2020 despite the 4.5 billion to 5 billion debt pay down. So is it just timing related? Maybe if you can kind of help reconcile that? And then along those lines, I guess to Justin's first question, so I'm sure \u2013 that's your repo, I mean, to the extent that you're doing in an accelerating it early on as an offset to the group disability and life does that mean any upside essentially in the first half of the year essentially is not going to carry through to the EPS line simply because of timing I guess. Thank you. Eric Palmer : Ralph its Eric, so on the interest expense, really nothing in particular I'd call out other than it may be looking out to the decimal point a little bit further and the timing throughout the year. Obviously, to the extent we were to extinguish that earlier, the interest expense will go down, but again, our current expectation would be for 1.6 billion as I noted in my prepared remarks. In terms of the timing on the capital deployment, the mechanics are consistent with what I outlined to Justin's question. And we do have flexibility in terms of the timing of which we would deploy or our expectation is that we would fully offset the absence of the group transition by reducing the share count through share repurchase. And we'll approach that as we go through the course of the coming months and quarters yeah. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Sarah James with Piper Sandler. Ma'am, your line is open. Sarah James : Thank you. Looking at the five year Medicare growth strategy, there's a shift to focus on PPO. Wondering what dynamics changed in the market to make PPO more attractive and why not focus on group given your large national account base. Your peers have had good success on retiree accounts. So why is that not a strategy pursuing? David Cordani : Sarah, good morning, it's David. So first and foremost, I wouldn't view it as a shift. We didn't go from something and away from something to something. So the individual HMO continues to be a bedrock of the platform and in fact is the major driver of our growth in 2020 as an example of that. We start to add the individual PPO platform to a portfolio invested to do so, stood it up and have the arrangements with the database provider community to be able to offer that. So it's expanding choice and building on a successful platform and track record. And as we both enter new markets and expanding counties, we will make our decisions in terms of individual HMO, individual PPO or both on a go forward basis. We just see it as an end, I mean, natural extension of our portfolio. Additionally, to your important point, we view that the employer marketplace is also a very attractive addressable market. And as you know, our national accounts are broad while performing commercial portfolios of employee relationships presents another opportunity for that. And it's on our growth trajectory. We're just very disciplined as it relates to building the momentum. So going from the proven HMO to adding the PPO, expanding geographies and you should expect us over time to come back and talk with you about the very attractive additional growth opportunities that exist in the employer marketplace for us as well. Sarah James : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Gary Taylor with JP Morgan. Your line is open, sir. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. Two quick numbers, questions, the first one is to Eric on the 80 basis point impact on the MLR from the HIF recurring next year. Just wondering, when you derive that, do you just presume that on MA there's no impact because there's no explicit growth up there, but just kind of a yes, no question? My other question was on the PBM, so for next year, you've got like 5% at the midpoint pre-tax growth on like 22% script growth. Obviously, the Prime scripts are coming in at breakeven you've told us. We know that the Optum scripts coming over or lower profitability per script. So when we just think about the core and the organic growth in script, should we have Assume that organic EBITDA margins are similar those new organic scripts are coming in at similar margins and in the sort of dilution and profitability per script is purely being driven by Optum and Prime? Eric Palmer : Hey, Gary its Eric. On the first part of your question, the short answer is yes. I think of that as not having a specific impact in terms of the quantification given there's not a way to specifically build that into how you bid for MA. On the second portion of your question, absolutely the answer is yes. The dynamics you outlined are really the biggest pieces here. When you adjust for the Prime volumes, I mean, you adjust for the Cigna transition volumes. I think of the core aside from those items is being consistent. Gary Taylor : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open, sir. Matthew Borsch : Thank you. Can I just ask about the commercial market maybe a little bit about what you're seeing from, I guess what you call your select segment in terms of preference to shift alternate funding away from risk? And you got any sense for how that may be affecting the risk pools. I'm asking the question partly why there's another company that spoke to seeing some deterioration in the remaining underwriting risk. David Cordani : Matthew its David, so specific to the commercial marketplace and I think you're going into the select segment. Recall that we offer choice in that marketplace. The choice is heavily oriented around a well configured integrated value proposition with the medical, the pharmacies, the behavior of the care management programs, et cetera and building choice around funding options. Today, think about from a new standpoint, it's tracking about 50-50. About 50% of a new business we're writing right now is risk about 50% of it is ASO stop loss plus or minus, and that vacillates in any given year, a little bit more of one a little bit more of the other and we're delighted with that. We're delighted to be able to be in position to offer it in that way. I'd also remind you from prior conversations, one of our friends, when you offer that choices, oftentimes you're literally offering that choice side by side. And it's a good validation for the purchaser, in this case, the client of our conviction to the ASO proposition when you're able to put the guarantee cost side by side. But today, think about it, the new business running about 50-50. And I wouldn't describe any difference we're seeing in terms of your terminology from a response standpoint and performance, it's performing really well for us. Matthew Borsch : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open, sir. Josh Raskin : Thanks. Good morning. I'm going to ask a little bit about capital deployment and you're talking about getting your debt to cap under 40% by the end of this year, you've got another 5.3 billion of proceeds from disability in life and 7.5 billion available deployable cash next year. You think about adding all these numbers up, and it's approaching 20% of the market cap. And I understand the priorities. But is there a little bit more urgency from a capital deployment perspective rather than sort of sitting on cash that's diluted to returns? Do you think about more aggressive buybacks? Is there a dividend increase things like that, I'm just curious if you're starting to feel a little bit more pressure in terms of that deployment? Eric Palmer : Josh its Eric. I appreciate the way you frame that up. Obviously, we're very excited about the capital generation that we've got, the cash flow from operations visibility that we've got for 2020 and into 2021 and that gives us a lot of flexibility. And we've got a really good track record of not to use your word sitting on cash, we will deploy the capital in a way that's effective and aligned with our shareholders interest and such versus just accumulating to be clear, but again, the overall history we've got from a \u2013 track record we've got from a effectiveness of capital deployment and managing our capital coupled up with the visibility and flexibility that we've got coming with the capital available for us is an exciting combination. David, I don't know what else to add that on that. David Cordani : Just to reinforce Josh and I appreciate your question. Recall from the \u2013 our strategic positioning, pre combination, aided to buy the combination, et cetera. Our ability to generate a significant amount of operating cash flow is a critical competency and we believe the strategic advantage with $9.5 billion in 2019, at least $7.5 billion in 2020 and at least 8.5 billion in 2021, so quite deliberate as Eric said. We note the importance of that responsibility, not something we take lightly, but our effective capital stewardship responsibility will be clear as we go forward and we have tremendous value creation opportunity in front of us right now. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Your line is open, sir. Lance Wilkes : Great, just had a question on the individual business line and the strategy and appetite in that business going forward. And then maybe also, if you can comment on the SG&A increase in Health Services for the fourth quarter, and maybe what drove that? David Cordani : Lance, good morning, it's David. I'll take the first question and I'll ask Eric to take the second part of your question. Individual business line, I'm presuming you're referencing the individual exchange. Just to remind everybody the individual exchange marketplace, we took a very focused deliberate posture on that \u2013 in that marketplace in 2014 and has stayed steady within that marketplace systematically, but slowly growing our posture. We're in 10 markets today. Think about the positioning of being in 10 markets highly oriented around leveraging our value based provider relationships. And that marketplace has performed pretty darn well in the last couple of years. Going forward we'll monitor the competitive landscape, but we see the ability to continue to grow that reasonably over time with fair returns. Cornerstone to our value proposition though is ensuring that in those states, we go down to sub MSA level and make sure we're building the value proper the offering around our highest performing physician relationships and getting the requisite alignment with the delivery system and thus far that's performed well for us. And we look forward to year in year out making individual decisions of additional market expansion. Eric, I'll ask you to address the SG&A comment. Eric Palmer : Yes. Lance its Eric. On the Health Services fourth quarter probably two items to have you think about on that front, one, as we noted throughout both David and my prepared remarks continue to spend to invest in terms of building a new and additional capabilities and such. Additionally, we're spending on facilitating and effectuating the transitions associated with the full reinforcing of the Cigna volumes in the life. The other item, I would just note that we've provided some commentary throughout the year last year around the effect of the transition in client going away since as the volumes that are transitioning clients wound down that added costs back into the core, if you will. And we're well on track to extinguish that as we work through 2020. Lance Wilkes : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open, sir. Peter Costa : Thank you. I like to follow up with \u2013 on Dave's question earlier about margins in Medicare and particular timing of when that'll start to add to your earnings from a perspective of how are you getting the members that you're getting today? Are they coming electronically? Are you setting up broker networks and can you talk a little bit about the channel and how that's going to evolve going forward? And then also in 20 21 with ESRD patients coming on, how do you expect that to impact your margins in the Medicare business? David Cordani : Peter its David. First, broadly speaking, just to reiterate, we're really pleased with the positioning we have in our existing MSAs and expanding into new markets are individuality to more platform is the lead offering still and the lead part of the growth chassis, aided by the new market entrees as well as the PPO platform. Specifically to your question of how we go-to-market, think about that as an end proposition, so it's a multi-channel approach relative to captive partnered and otherwise and expect that to continue to expand over time. Specific to the margins, as I mentioned to the prior question, the margins we would expect to be at the lower end of the range that we've put out as a long-term range, as we accelerate our growth trajectory over the near term, potentially taking below that having said that, with a growth we would have earnings growth, that that brings along with it. And finally relative ESRD, as we flagged in the past when asked that question, it will be a smaller impact on our aggregate franchise. We will manage the final ESRD posture, MSA by MSA, benefit offering by benefit offering in alignment with our value based physicians. And we will be well positioned to manage that to the extent the final changes transpired is currently proposed from that standpoint. Net-net taken together attractive growth, even at the lower end of the margin range, we will be experiencing earnings expansion while simultaneously investing for growth going forward. Peter Costa : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open, sir. Frank Morgan : Thank you, two real quick questions. Any thoughts on last night CMAs proposed rule around 2021 you may rate updates and in any update on the Cigna Anthem litigation. Thanks. David Cordani : Frank its David. Specific to the rate notice, as you might imagine, we're digesting the detail of a given the magnitude of it. It's the preliminary notice you know the process in terms of getting to the final rate notice. And big picture, I would suggest the aware in macro in line with the aggregation of what that rate notice indicates. And when we think about the posture that rate notice, the expansion of our shores proposition for 2021 will be in good shape for 2021. More to follow, but big picture, our impact is broadly speaking in line with what the rate notice speaks to. And as it relates to the \u2013 you asked specifically about the Cigna Anthem litigation that is on course to resolve itself by the end of this calendar month. Frank Morgan : Any other color you can hear on that? What gives you confidence it would be wrapped up this month and will that result in a settlement payment? David Cordani : Probably in specificity relative to litigation other than I would reinforce, we feel very strong about our position relative to our contractual responsibility and contractual ability to collect a break fee and the court is on is on track to resolve that by the end of this calendar month. Frank Morgan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open. George Hill : Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. I guess Dave you talked a lot about the partnership strategy and maybe digging a little bit more into Prime \u2013 the Prime deal. I guess, can you talk about the network component of it? And I guess where you guys see the most significant points of operating leverage that deliver through to earnings beyond 2020? Is it more on the rebate side or is it more on the network side? And kind of can you talk a little bit about the strength that each side brought to the relationship? David Cordani : Yeah, I'm not going to go through the micro pieces of the components of the relationship, but I'd rather just reframe what we're trying to achieve together. This is a wonderful example of two organizations identifying philosophical alignment and strategic alignment and then pursuing leverage that results in additional value for customers and clients. That's the end of and the net- net of this, which is improved affordability, potentially improved coordinated access and then clinical program leverage on a go forward basis. We will continue to work with Prime in terms of the best ways in which we could add additional value for them. There's 28 million individual relationships that \u2013 or customers and members that are within the Prime relationship and we'll be guided by the components that they feel we can create the most value for will make value added suggestions and evolve that over time, all with the objective of creating more value for their members and clients and therefore getting some benefit for Cigna as well over time. So we're delighted with it. It's another validation of our ability to work with other likeminded partners to create mutual value. George Hill : Maybe a quick follow up then, how do we think about you guys effectively strengthening a competitor at the margin or kind of enabling their competition against you in the PBM business? David Cordani : I appreciate the question. We think about it the exact opposite way. It's a dynamic marketplace and those who create the most valuable win, those who try to preserve or regress to control value will lose over time. So big picture, we're more oriented around a perpetual innovation cycle and continue to drive more value. And we like to do that with others and create mutual value. We have a long track record, the legacy of the ESI [ph] has that, the legacy of Cigna has that and we're fueling more of it. So this is an opportunity to create more value for 28 million more customers starting in 2020, and further improve affordability and further improve quality from that standpoint, that's a great outcome. Each organization has to continue to innovate. Each organization has to deliver value and there's ample growth opportunity in front of both organizations going forward and we'll align to mutually identify beneficial opportunities for both organizations to grow. But the cornerstone is innovation and more value delivery. So we view it as upside not downside. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir. Ricky Goldwasser : Yeah. Hi, good morning. As we start thinking about a 2021 selling season for the PBM business, can you give us some sense of the size of the book that's up for renewal? And also any order? What's the size of the opportunities you're seeing that's up in the market from the other PBMs? And then my second question is on the MA growth guidance, obviously, you came in \u2013 the guidance you base in January was ahead of your initial goal that these near term goals, so maybe you can share with us what really resonated in the marketplace and what do you think drove the above expectations, performance or at least it materializing earlier? David Cordani : Ricky, good morning, its David, specific to the 2021 PBM selling season break that up as new components, health plan relationships, corporate relationships, as we sit here today, they help find relationships as you would expect and draw close your completion sooner given the size, shape and scope of those relationships. They're substantially completed through the renewal cycle and we feel great about the outcome. So that would be the picture I give you for 2021, continued trends from that standpoint. The corporate part of the relationships are getting into full steam right now. We think we're going to have another very good year from that standpoint and our value proposition is resonating very well in the marketplace, specifically relative to our value proposition and some of the new innovations that we put into the marketplace, be it the patient assurance program, be it health connect 360, et cetera. Put a circle around it in aggregate, think about the size of the book moving or up to move about from a normal standpoint. As it relates to Medicare Advantage, pleased that you're calling out the fact that a bit ahead of the market we put down before, remind you we said 10% to 15% on average over time, we said in our first year, we were expected to be at the lower end of the range as we were stepping into that new result. There's no one driver, what moves us to the 13% to 16%, I would call out a bit higher retention. So what we had initially put into our projection our retentions even higher, we love that. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're sitting in an MPS right now, just in excess of 70 across the aggregate book of business that we have and the vast majority of our customers in this space are in value based arrangement. So I wouldn't call it anything else. My existing platforms drove the majority of it, our new markets contributed, and we had a bit higher retention rate. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open, sir. Scott Fidel : Hi, guys. Good morning. Question just on hospital volumes and there's been a little bit of debate on whether those have been picking up or not over the course of the year and just interested from your perspective across both the commercial and Medicare books, what you saw in terms of hospital volumes in the fourth quarter and how those trended relative to your expectations. Eric Palmer : Hey Scott its Eric. Overall, nothing that I would call out as particularly notable, we finished the year with the trends of above 4%, which is right in the middle of our expectations. So there's nothing that I would call out as a particular change in trajectory in either the commercial or in the government business. Scott Fidel : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open, sir. Steven Valiquette : All right, great. Thanks and good morning, Dave and Eric. Thanks for taking the question. So I have two just somewhat interrelated questions on pharmacy? And I guess first, are you able to provide a little more color on your drug procurement strategy going forward for the PBM mail order operations? It's from some conjecture that you may be changing one of your buying group relationships. I'm not sure if you able to comment on that or not. And then secondarily in pharmacy for the 3.5% to 4.5% commercial medical cost trend that you're expecting for 2020. Are you able to discuss whether this includes any incremental pharmacy savings and maybe a lower pharmacy trend this year versus prior years, which obviously may be tied to further integration? Thanks. David Cordani : Good morning, it's David. I'll take the first question and I'll ask Eric to take the second question. We don't get into individual actions we're taking relative to our supply chain or procurement strategy. I would just step back and say we have a broad portfolio of tools, solutions and capabilities. And we're going to continue to dynamically manage those to get the best possible value for existing and prospective customers and clients going forward. Beyond that, we're not going to comment on any individual actions we're taking in the supply chain activity. Eric, could you comment on the trend. Eric Palmer : Yeah, Steve on the trend, we've had pharmacy trend in that low to mid-single digits range for some time now, I mean, that would be the expectation we'd have going into 2020 as well. Just to remind you Express Scripts delivered in 2018 a 0.4% commercial trend. We're publishing our Express Scripts client or trends report later this month, and expect another really attractive result there. But to begin, nothing else I would call out. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our last question will be from Charles Rhyee - Cowen. Your line is open. Charles Rhyee : Yeah. Hey, thanks for squeezing me in here. Maybe I can ask about \u2013 you look at the chart here in your presentation. And obviously, over the last 10 years you've really driven your medical cost trend down. And you're guiding 3.5% to 4.5%. If I'm not mistaken, that's sort of same range you gave last year. I know you've talked about trying to get towards CPI, anything in the short-term that might be keeping you in this range. Can you talk about what are the factors that you're seeing that's going to help you to get lower from here and sort of how we should think about the pacing of that? Thanks. David Cordani : Charles good morning, first to your point, we're delighted with the fact that we have seven years now going into a plus in terms of delivering the lowest medical cost trend in the industry. And our clients and customers benefit from that immediately, especially given the profile of our business highly ASO oriented from that standpoint and will continue to drive exceptional value for our clients and customers. Two, I appreciate you calling out the CPI level goal and objective. A couple of years ago we put forth a strategic objective which said we strive to deliver a level of medical cost trend approximating CPI by 2021. We view that is indicative of a sustainable trend that the system and society could tolerate and manage on a go forward basis and indicative of a responsible trend. I would note that today we feel like we're well on our way to that journey. And I would underscore that with the fact that many of our clients today who have established relationships with us and are leveraging our most advanced consumer engagement, health improvement and value based relationships are benefiting from CPI or better trend from that standpoint. So there's a toolkit we have that will continue to innovate and evolve around how do we get engagement in support of the consumer in the life journey? How do we evolve the precision and speed of the health improvement programs, especially as we continue to expand in the whole person health arena on an accelerated basis with our market leading behavioral health and pharmacy capabilities? And then just further deepening the activation of value based care delivery platforms that we have in the marketplace and we're already able to deliver as I indicated, CPI are better for many of our clients. We're going to see \u2013 further expand that in 2020 and beyond. I appreciate your question. Operator : Thank you for your question. I will now turn the conference over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : Thank you. To wrap up, I'd like to highlight just a few key points from today's conversation. First, to remind your Cigna delivered exceptional full year 2019 financial results across our four growth platforms led by Health Services and Integrated Medical segments. We exceeded the guidance we had already raised each quarter for 2019 for revenue, earnings and EPS as well as for cash flow from operations. Looking forward, our 2019 performance gives us considerable momentum for attractive growth in 2020 and beyond. In 2020, we will continue to drive significant growth in customer relationships, revenue, earnings, EPS, as well as continued strong operating cash flow. We are on track to complete our integration activities associated with our combination with Express Scripts over the next year. We expect to close the sale of our group disability life business to New York Life in the third quarter. We're on track to return our balance sheet to normalized levels and debt and be in a position to provide exceptional strategic financial flexibility moving forward, just as we committed to when we announced our combination two years ago. And we're well positioned to drive attractive growth beyond 2020 and on track to deliver our 2021 EPS target of $20 to $21 per share. We thank you for joining our call today and we look forward to our future conversations. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's fourth quarter 2019 results review.

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter the queue to ask question at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen this conference including the Q&A session is being recorded. We will begin by turning the conference over to Mr. William McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell. William McDowell : Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining today's call. I\u2019m Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. As we begin our call, I would note that we are practicing appropriate social distancing and as such are dialed into today's call from separate locations. I would ask for your patience should we as a result, encounter any technical difficulties. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics including Cigna's first quarter 2020 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2020. As noted in our earnings release when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues which are not determined in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income, and total revenues respectively is contained in today's earnings release which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled Adjusted Income from Operations and Adjusted Earnings per Share on this same basis as our principle measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some Forward-Looking Statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2020 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the first quarter we recorded after tax special items netting to a charge of $191 million or $0.51 per share. As detailed in our financial supplement, special items in the first quarter include expenses associated with the previously disclosed early extinguishment of debt, as well as integration and transaction related costs and other matters. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of financial results. Please note that consistent with past practice when we make prospective comments regarding finance performance, including our full year 2020 outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future share repurchases, or additional prior year development of medical costs. Also, we disclosed prior year development on both a gross and net basis in our release this morning. Going forward, we will only report this measure on a gross basis consistent with industry practice. Additionally, our outlook for 2020 assumes a full year of earnings from Cigna's group disability and life business. We continue to expect our divestiture of that business to be completed in the third quarter of 2020. And with that, I will turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks Will and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. I'd like to begin by acknowledging the unique and unprecedented challenge of COVID-19's global pandemic and the tireless effort of those on the frontline caring for patients in need. At Cigna, we have worked to ensure the health and safety of our customers, patients and collogues and we will continue to partner across the system to lead through this crisis. While the COVID-19 emergency understandably and rightfully dominates much of our focus, we do want to take the advantage of our time together today to provide you with an update on our first quarter results and our outlook for the balance of 2020. Following my comments, Eric will share more detail about our first quarter financial results and expectations for the balance of 2020. Then we'll take your questions. Let's begin by discussing the rapid and decisive steps we've taken to respond to the COVID-19 crisis. From the beginning of this health emergency, we established three primary goals for response efforts, first and foremost, to attend to the needs of our stakeholders across the globe. For customers and patients we've taken steps to remove costs and barriers for testing a treatment, ensure they have access to the medications and expand access to care including through additional telehealth services for medical, behavioral and recently for dental health. For clients, we've leveraged our consultative approach and proactively provided them with support and services they need. This includes serving as trusted advisors for those seeking guidance and how to navigate this dynamic and challenging environment and providing relief for those in financial distress. For our healthcare provider partners, we've given them administrative as well as targeted financial support. Additionally, in partnership with New York Life, we've created the Brave of Heart Fund for the true heroes of the COVID-19 crisis. This fund, with contributions from our respective foundations aims to provide $100 million or more in monetary and other assistance to frontline health care workers, their support teams and the families. We're proud to have taken this action which reinforces the service orientation of both Cigna and New York Life, as we work together on an accelerated basis to bring peace of mind to the brave men and women who are so valiantly serving our communities. Additionally, for 70,000 colleagues around the globe, we've also taken appropriate steps to protect their health and well-being. For example, we are providing premium pay for those essential workers whose jobs continue to be Cigna site dependent. And we're providing 10 additional days of emergency time off to cover absences related to the virus and allow our co-workers to care for themselves and their loved ones during this challenging time. Our second goal in responding to COVID-19 crisis is to ensure that we maintain a healthy organization that is well positioned to deliver significant value for all of our stakeholders today and into the future. We know and appreciate the fact that many are depending on us now more than ever, and we need to be there for them in this time of crisis and beyond. We're focused on balancing all of these needs and ensuring we maintain strength of our franchise by continuing to invest in growth, our cape abilities, ongoing innovation and in our talent. Finally, another key goal of our response to COVID-19 crisis is to ensure we are a proactive part of the solution partnering both at national as well as local levels. We've played an active role in driving a high level of collaboration across government, not for profit and private sector organizations in response to this pandemic. While we are proud of our response to date, we will continue to drive our entire organization to give voice to and work for the benefit of our key stakeholders. Now, turning briefly to our results, our first quarter results were strong, consolidated adjusted revenue grew to $38.4 billion and after tax earnings grew to $1.76 billion, including high single digit earnings growth in our Health Service business, which was somewhat ahead of our expectations. Our team achieved these results through focused execution of our business strategies and by continuing to expand key relationships and partnerships and working to make healthcare more affordable, predictable and simple. Now, the strength of our first quarter results driven by the performance of our underlying fundamentals reinforces our confidence that our well positioned diverse Health Service portfolio will again deliver attractive top line and bottom line growth in 2020, including strong cash flows. As such, we are reaffirming our full year EPS outlook of $18 to $18. 60. Well, the impact of COVID-19 is still developing, we clearly see headwinds driven by the recession it's causing, including, for example, disenrollment within our commercial customers, both in our Integrated Medical business as well as our Health Service business, as well as some pressure in our Group Disability business. As for medical cost, we expect somewhat offsetting impacts from elevated COVID-19 claims cost and lower medical cost from deferred procedures. We fully recognize this is a dynamic environment. However, we expect the strength of our first quarter to drive us to another strong year for revenue, earnings and free cash flow. All while we continue to invest in and support the needs of our key stakeholders. As we look forward, there is no doubt that COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted opportunities for improvement in the healthcare system, which we believe will accelerate change in our industry. This evolution is likely to usher in a new call for an embrace of innovative and disruptive solutions, a new wave of broadened partnerships, and a need for even greater levels of differentiated value in the marketplace. At Cigna, we have both the capabilities and orientation to further differentiate ourselves in this rapidly evolving industry. The work we've done to harness the full capabilities following our combination with Express Scripts has positioned us to deliver exceptional value for the benefit of our customers, patients and clients in an environment that is demanding solutions to health care's most pressing problems. To achieve this, we have deep and broad clinical strength from our medical, behavioral and pharmacy services, and broad data and insight capabilities. In addition, we have substantial financial strength and capital health, aided by our capitalized framework. As we have positioned our company, not to be tied to capital intensive investments in bricks-and-mortar assets or care delivery ownership. This gives us tremendous strategic flexibility and positions us to drive forward with solutions that make healthcare more affordable, predictable and simple for those we serve. Our approach is further fueled by our partnership orientation. Recent examples include, MDLIVE and Buoy Health, each of which make it more simple for individuals to access care. With MDLIVE for example, earlier this year Cigna became the first partner to offer virtual care for annual checkups. And as the COVID-19 crisis evolved, we temporarily transferred hundreds of our nurses and physicians to MDLIVE to further expand their capacity. With Buoy Health, in January we harnessed Buoy's capabilities to quickly launch an early intervention tool, which is now available to assess COVID-19 risk for individuals in the US. With this innovative technology, customers can assess their symptoms and make informed decisions about their next steps for care all within the comfort and safety of their homes. MDLIVE and Buoy Health are just two recent examples of our broad portfolio of partnerships around the world. Now to summarize, Cigna's strategic framework provides us with the foundation to respond quickly and effectively to the COVID-19 health emergency, all while we delivered strong first quarter results. We have expanded our services and support for customers, patients, clients, healthcare partners, colleagues and communities. All while continuing to ensure that our company remains well positioned to deliver value whenever and however it is needed, both today and into the future. This fuels our expectations of delivering sustained attractive top line and bottom line growth in 2020 and continuing in 2021. Now, none of this would be possible without the hard work and dedication of our colleagues around the globe. Every day, their commitment and passion embodies our mission to improve the health well-being and peace of mind to those we serve. This has never been more clear and defining than over the last several months, as they've stepped up in countless ways to support the needs of our key stakeholders around the globe at a time when they most need us. Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Eric. Eric Palmer : Thanks David and good morning everyone. In my remarks today, I'll briefly review key aspects of Cigna's first quarter results, discuss our outlook for the full year inclusive of the impacts and our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. And although my remarks today will be primarily financially focused, I'd like to acknowledge that in full alignment with Cigna's mission strategy during these uniquely challenging times our company is focused on serving the needs of our customers, our clients and our providers, as well as ensuring the safety of our employees. Now regarding our first quarter consolidated results, a few key financial highlights include adjusted revenue of $38.4 billion, adjusted earnings of $1.76 billion after tax, adjusted earnings per share of $4.69 and continued strong operating cash flow of $1.9 billion. Cigna's first quarter results reflect the underlying strength of our businesses and the value we deliver to our customers and clients. Within our business segments, Health Services, Integrated Medical and International, all performed at or somewhat ahead of our expectations. But also note that given the timing of the pandemics onset and progression in the United States, its impact to first quarter results was limited. Overall, Cigna's first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our diverse portfolio of businesses, each of which remains intensely focused on improving the health, well-being and peace of mind for those we serve. Now, as we look to the balance of 2020, I'd start by observing that at Cigna we fully recognize that we are in unprecedented times as we navigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. And I'm proud of the many ways that Cigna's responding with an acceleration of our efforts in the marketplace to make healthcare more affordable, predictable and simple. We're partnering across the ecosystem and we are leading in providing resources and services as well as in adapting plan designs to ensure we're meeting those needs. Aided by our strong and diverse portfolio of businesses, we're reaffirming our full year 2020 outlook for consolidated adjusted revenues in the range of $154 billion to $156 billion. And to put some additional context around our full year expectations or adjusted earnings per share, I'd remind you that Cigna ended 2019 with considerable strength and momentum across their businesses. And that carried through the first quarter, with strong underlying fundamentals, evident in both results above our previous expectations and in the meaningful amounts of capital we deployed, including ongoing reinvestment for growth, debt repayment, and returns to shareholders through share repurchase. We recognize the COVID-19 pandemic presents challenges for all businesses and Cigna's no exception. In the first quarter, we saw the onset and incidence of virus begin to ramp globally. But its pace and the diversification of our businesses resulted in a limited impact. Over the balance of this year, we expect headwinds to our performance from the pandemic to include declines in customers across our Commercial Employer and Health Services businesses relative to our prior expectations and some unfavorability in our Group Disability business. Regarding medical costs, we expect higher costs associated with COVID-19 treatment offset by lower levels of utilization related to the deferral of procedures. Now, it's important to note that we serve 85% of Cigna's US Commercial customers through self-funding arrangements. And as such, our medical cost performance is highly aligned with our clients. The quarterly progression of earnings within Integrated Medical will vary somewhat from historical patterns, with lower utilization expected in the second quarter and an expectation of elevated services in the back half of 2020. From an enterprise perspective, I'd highlight that we continue to expect strong volume growth this year in Pharmacy Services, Specialty Pharmacy Care, and in Medicare Advantage, all while we continue to drive overall expense efficiencies. These considerations underscore the strength and diversity in our portfolio of businesses, which continue to deliver solutions directly aligned with marketplace needs throughout the year. We will continue to invest in innovation and in capabilities to serve our customers and clients and to have the ability to flex to meet their needs. Impacts from COVID-19 to our financial outlook will be influenced by the duration and the extent of the pandemic and the related economic and employment challenges. We will continue to monitor developments related to the pandemic as we progress through the year and are committed to supporting our customers, clients, health care partners and communities that they confront the many challenges this environment presents. To enable our customers and clients to better afford in access care, we are working to customize our solutions and arrangements, as well as leveraging our partnerships with the healthcare delivery system. Taken as a whole, we continue to expect full year consolidated adjusted earnings per share in the range of $18 to $18.60. I would also remind you that our financial outlook excludes the impact of future share repurchases and any additional prior year reserve development and also assumes a full year of contributions from our Group Disability and Life business, although we continue to expect our divestiture of that business to close in the third quarter. Overall, these expected results are driven by strong underlying fundamentals, disciplined expense management, and deployment of capital, partially offset by pressures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, moving to our 2020 capital and liquidity position and outlook, our capital efficient businesses generate a substantial amount of cash flow, which provides us with financial flexibility, particularly in times of stress. In the first quarter, we generated $1.9 billion of cash flows from operations. We also deployed $1.1 billion to debt repayment in the first quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased 5.9 million shares of stock for $1.1 billion. For 2020, we continue to expect greater than $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well performing businesses. Looking to our liquidity and flexibility, as of March 31, 2020, we had $1.6 billion of cash available to the parent. In April, we entered into a term loan for $1.4 billion to further enhance our current liquidity position in light of disruptions in the commercial paper market. We feel very good about the cash flows that our businesses generate and our overall liquidity. And I would also note that we have access to an additional $4.25 billion in committed and untapped revolving lines of credit. Finally, we're on track to close the sale of our Group Disability and Life business in the third quarter, generating $5.3 billion in net proceeds, which we expect to deploy to share repurchase and debt repayment in 2020. Our debt to capitalization ratio was 44.7% as of March 31, down from 45.2% as of December 31 of 2019. And we remain on track to return our debt to capitalization ratio, the upper 30s at the end of 2020. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remain strong, benefiting from a highly efficient service based orientation to drive strategic flexibility, strong margins, and returns on capital. Now, to recap, against the challenging backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, Cigna's intensified our focus on delivering exceptional value for the benefit of our customers, patients and all of our stakeholders. We're fully committed to ensuring the safety of our employees, providing continuity of services for our customers and clients and working collaboratively with physician partners. We're also doing so while seeking to deliver differentiated sustainable value back to our communities. We ended 2019 with strength across our diversified portfolio of global businesses, which we carried through to a strong first quarter performance. The fundamentals of our business are strong and durable, which positions us very well to support our customers, clients, healthcare partners, and communities in this challenged and dynamic environment. Although mix of these contributions is somewhat different, we expect these strong fundamentals across a diverse portfolio of businesses to enable us to manage through the various impacts of the current environment. And as such, we're reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS outlook for 2020 and remain committed to our objective of achieving $20 to $21 of earnings per share in 2021. With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open, sir. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Glad to hear everyone's staying safe. Just wanted to ask you're reiterating your outlook for 2021. Clearly, there's a more uncertain economic backdrop today than there was when you originally gave it six months ago. What \u2013 as you think through your business lines, should we assume that that reiteration reflects the fact that you had so much momentum that you got some cushion in the numbers, so even if the economic environment turns out a little tougher, you're okay? Or should we assume that maybe you don't think the business will be impacted that much by the economic environment, can you just flesh out why you're confident in reiterating the 2021 outlook? David Cordani : A.J., good morning, it's David, good to hear your voice. Hope you and your family are well. So for 2021, to put context first and foremost, you know that we established that target when we announced our combination with Express Scripts over two years ago, and since then we have remained on track to achieve it. We recognize and doubt that the current environment is highly disrupted. Although we believe the goal is both achievable and remains an appropriate target. You're correct. I wouldn't use the word cushion. I would use the word momentum and strength. So we've been able to effectively execute our integration and that remains on track and performing quite strong, the core businesses within our portfolio, our service oriented portfolio with diverse solutions and diverse funding mechanisms to be able to flex in a very dynamic marketplace and environment from that standpoint. And when we look at our performance stepping in through 2020, we consider our first quarter results through and then carry through the month of April. As we look at our results, we believe that target is still appropriate and achievable from that standpoint, I would note clearly inferred in your comment, the biggest wildcard for every industry is the \u2013 would be the depth and breadth and duration of a global recession. So that crystal ball no one has perfectly, but the ballast of our business portfolio and high performing diverse business portfolio gives us confidence that that's the proper target. A.J. Rice: Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rice for your question. Our next question is from Gary Taylor with JP Morgan. Your line is open, sir. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning, everybody. A few questions, I guess, this one I would stick with, can we go to Healthcare Services segment the 12% growth in the EBITDA there was very strong. Can you give us some sense on how much of that was improvement in synergies, core operations versus some pull forward perhaps from the 2Q because of pre-sales and others? Eric Palmer : Gary, it's Eric, I'll give you a couple of perspectives on that. So overall, we're really pleased with the performance of the services \u2013 Health Services business in the first quarter. As David noted, a minute ago, we've made really good progress in terms of the transition of the Cigna Life again and continue to work on integration and the like. You referenced kind of the impact of any amounts that were pulled forward and things along those lines. I would note that we had approximately 5 million scripts or 1%, 1.5% of the volume that we ended up having in the first quarter. That was \u2013 we view as being pulled forward from later periods, so we point to that as a relatively modest impact in terms of the impact of the results in the first quarter. And more generally, we just come back to strong results and continued traction in terms of integration program. At last, I would not call out any additional synergies or differences there versus our prior expectations. Gary Taylor : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Taylor. Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open, sir. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning, David, I was hoping you could expand your thoughts on sort of the lingering or long-term consequences of COVID and just the potential impact and how you see it to your business both in terms of employer appetite or not for risk bearing ASO versus fully insured, that holistic approach that you kind of bring to the market with your suite of products. And then just your positioning and interest in segments of the market like individual or Medicaid or where you've historically been a smaller player. Thanks. David Cordani : Good morning, Ralph. So if we step back, I think one of the perspectives that the current environment reinforces is the power of an importance of the role of the employer. So stepping back, we need to understand the fact that for an employer to have a vibrant business, they need healthy, productive, present highly engaged co-workers. And in some way the crisis actually reinforces the role of the employer in terms of creating a safe environment, but an environment that actually creates a healthy environment and an environment that has a level of productivity and engagement. And I for one I'm just pleased to see how corporations have stepped up relative to co-worker safety, co-worker engagement protocols, even the number of employers that have stepped forward where they had employment dislocation by maintaining continuity of benefits. So point one is we see that is quite important. As it relates to the funding mechanism, I don't see a broad swing. We don't project forwarded broad swing. Having said that, we maintain a diverse portfolio of funding mechanisms and we offer choice for employer clients on a regular basis that has been and that will continue to be a strength, so our ability to have the flexibility we think is quite important, but we don't see this broadly swinging one way or the other from ASO to guarantee costs or vice versa. As it relates to segment expansion, we've positioned our business portfolio to be able to continue to expand, so our Health Service portfolio is really critical strategic expansion. We're offering a broad array of services, both to corporate clients, health plans, governmental entities and increasingly over time, healthcare delivery infrastructures on all sorts of products and programs and services we see as mission critical, so cutting across funding mechanisms up through Medicaid from that standpoint. And then finally, we've systematically expanded our individual business and our biases to do so. And as you'll note, my final comment is from the past, we see over time, the state base risk bearing program or performance based program is an additional growth opportunity for us, if there is high level of clinical engagement, clinical coordination, so we like our positioning. Appreciate the role of the employer, employers are stepping up big in the marketplace today taking care of their employees as best they can and dynamically doing so. And we see for the growth opportunities in our core chassis in our expanded Health Services as well as individual programs. Ralph Giacobbe : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Mr. Giacobbe. Our next question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir. Justin Lake : Thanks. Just wanted to \u2013 I have a question and also a follow up. So just first to follow up on A.J's question around 2021, can you talk specifically about the building blocks that are going better, that will offset the potential headwinds to employer growth? And then my question was around share repurchase. You bought a bunch of stock in the first quarter. Can you talk about the turn potentially into April? Can you tell me about the timing of that first of all? And then given that it looks like the repurchase is a little bit bigger than I would have expected. Can you talk about, one, is that a personal purchase that's tied to the \u2013 are you buying back with proceeds that you expect to get from the Disability sale in the third quarter? And anything about a potential pause into repurchase relative to what you were seeing kind of others do out there would be helpful as well? Thanks. David Cordani : Justin, you have packed a lot in there. So let me take the first and make a qualitative comment on the second, but ask Eric to take the second question. Broadly speaking, we're not going to walk through the detailed building blocks for 2021. We'll do that when we get into providing detailed guidance for 2021. I would ask you to consider going back and looking at the Investor Day walkthrough that Eric provided. And he put forth the building blocks that exists in terms of cross walking us from '19 to '20 to '21 from that standpoint. I'll remind you of a few just as illustrations for the broader audience, right. The impact of deleveraging, we know it, we understand it, it's more within our control versus not the impact of synergies, we know it, we understand it. Our integration program is well in track and well in hand, our impact of capital deployment, before we get into the foundation and fundamental pieces of the equation from that standpoint. And then finally, inverting your comment was the effective disenrollment, two comments. One is what we're seeing thus far and it's just that thus far is both in our Integrated Medical business as well as in our Health Service business. For those corporate employers who have had co-worker dislocation, fully half of those employers are maintaining continuity of benefits, either through the word furlough or by having layoffs, but with benefit continuity, which reinforces an expectation of a more short lived effect, as well as the roles that the employers are playing. And then finally, related to that our health service portfolio gives us a much broader level of services to offer to the marketplace, as opposed to being held to just Integrated Medical sale versus not. The qualitative comment I'd give you on stock repurchases. I hand it over to Eric for more specifics is we recognize the dynamic dynamics of the environment. Just two points, one, our stock repurchase that was done in the first quarter was largely done before the COVID-19 epidemic spiked up intensely in the United States. And secondly, given the unique nature of having a large strategic divestiture, which is what we have for later this year. That is a more unique event where the responsible thing to do is to put that capital back in our shareholders hands largely because it is a unique onetime event from that. But I'll ask Eric to expand a little further on the repo. Eric Palmer : David, thanks, and Justin, I hope you're doing well. With respect to the share repurchase, as you noted, we did deploy just over a billion dollars over the course of the first quarter. And really think of that as \u2013 back in the framework that I've talked about in terms of our use of capital and touched overall for the year, right. So between the cash flow from operations that we expected to generate, as well as the proceeds from the group divestiture that we expect to close in the third quarter, we talked about having both of those as sources of capital available for deployment and that we would navigate toward year-end debt to capitalization ratio of below 40% and reduce the share count to effectively offset the portion of the year where we don't have the group business so that the impact would be neutral on EPS for the year. And we've got flexibility in navigating through that. And that's the framework in which we deployed the capital in the first quarter. Operator : Thank you for your question. Mr. Lake. Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open, sir. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. Just wondering I guess we can all kind of do the math on how the recession will impact the health benefits side of the business. But I guess if you could talk about the Health Services side a little bit more? It's not 100% clear to me how that business would be expected to perform in a recession, so any color you can give on kind of typical declines in utilization per person during a recession, as well as kind of your overall membership mix within that, how much of that businesses is related to commercial numbers versus serving Medicare or Medicaid numbers for your customers? Thanks. David Cordani : Kevin, good morning, it's David. Appreciate your question. Broadly speaking, we would see it just in terms of painting a macro picture relative to traditional integrated corporate facing medical and integrated benefits a little less disruptive versus not. Why? Point two is think about that business is serving corporate clients, typically larger corporate clients. Secondly, health plans with diverse portfolios of services from commercial through Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs and then a large government contract. Second, in the services that it provides, those services are somewhat foundational in nature. So the pharmaceutical utilization broadly speaking that individuals need do not change dramatically as a result of a recession. It's not a deferrable event typically from that standpoint, so it has a bit more balance in terms of both the diversity of the client base that exists within it and then the core foundational aspect that comes along with it. As I noted to a prior question, as well, we're seeing in the Health Service space that for those corporate clients, and I'll ask Eric to give you a little bit more color in terms of broader split in a second, for those corporate clients. Those that actually have had a reduction in workforce, fully 50% of them are maintaining benefits on behalf of those individuals. So headline, we see it is a bit less disrupted from a recession versus the traditional business you would think of in terms of measuring it against for the reasons I mentioned. I'll ask Eric to just give you a little bit more color in terms of splits. Eric Palmer : Yeah, so Kevin, it's Eric. Maybe a couple of things I would add here to David's answer. So first of all, we did provide some statistics in terms of a little bit of a makeup of kind of the distribution of scripts across the different channels and such. In fact, in the Investor Day last year, an order of magnitude about 400 million of the scripts associated with the commercial business, so though a meaningful block of business to be sure, but one of several different components of the book of business that we have within Express Scripts, so pretty well diversified. I think David covered the dynamics in terms of the consistency of the volumes and such for the benefit of our patients and such. I think maybe the last thing I would note is just the positive impacts of mail order that that we experienced in the first quarter and we think will be durable. Yeah, right. So as we've talked about for some time, mail order carries with it a number of benefits, right, better dispensing accuracy. Once you get on mail order, you're more likely to stay with your prescription that helps to keep gaps in care from being remaining open or being open and such. And obviously we've got a quite a leading operation in terms of the home delivery pharmacy. So we feel really good about the ability to use that to help serve our customers as well. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question is from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir. George Hill : Yeah. Good morning, David and Eric, and thanks for taking the question. David, I'm really intrigued by your comments on the disenrollment thing that hampered maintaining continuity of benefits. I guess, are you able to put any more color around the dynamic of the falling enrollment versus falling medical costs? I guess I'm just trying to think about, obviously, the medical costs seem to keep falling faster. I'm wondering is that the same in the PBM versus the medical business? And then I guess do you have any sense of the permanence of the expectations. I'm trying to figure out if this is the difference of getting laid off and getting six weeks or three months of health care after getting laid off or whether or not employers are looking at this as some type of more permanent setup expecting to bring employees back in the balance of the year. Thanks. I know it's a lot. David Cordani : Yeah, George, I appreciate it. And it's a bit of a different dynamic that we're confronting on a whole variety basis. So let's maybe unpack that a little bit. First, on the cost side of the equation, headline answer is no. So what I mean by that is, your inference of a falloff in medical costs is that similar to the fall off in pharmacy costs, no, because in furthering your comment is the fall off in medical costs is correlated to the deferrable experiences of medical, there's not a similar one-for-one correlation in pharmacy as relates to fall off. Now, there may be a small amount if there's a deferrable procedure, and there would have been a follow on script of that individual retaking on the back end that procedure, but by and large, I would separate those two as having a different effect in the different impact. Specific to the disenrollment dynamic, put one is what we see is corporations and it's an important pause moment in the United States, corporations we see are really striving to where it all possible, take care of their co-workers and see this as ideally a more temporary dislocation of their business. And hence want to maintain continuity or tethering, meaning ties, positive ties with the co-workers as such fully 50% both in our Integrated Medical and our Health Service business or maintaining benefits with their employees from that standpoint, not with a 30 day timeline currently, obviously, there'll be re-visitations of that from that standpoint, but it's sort of full on expectation of those individual corporations expecting \u2013 fully expecting to bring business back. You'll also note \u2013 bring employees back when the business comes back. You'll also note that part of the Federal narrative right now is around stimulus evolution and regulatory evolution is providing further evaluation of providing further incentives and subsidies to employers beyond the small employer subsidy around the benefit continuity because the data would show that the benefit continuity is better for society at large by keeping people healthy in the first place from the transition standpoint. So point is it's a unique time corporations are reaching I think constructively where at all possible, both large, medium and small where possible to maintain that level of continuity and evolving governmental posture around providing additional incentives or support to be able to do so. Hope that's helpful? George Hill : That is, thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Hill. Our next question is from Miss. Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ma'am, your line is open. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. Good morning. So when we think about the progression to your point that there's a lot of uncertainty regarding the timing, but if we think about a scenario of second surge and you think about the balance of continued falling in medical costs versus more severe unemployment. Do you still feel comfortable under that type of more bearish scenario in the 2020, in the 2021 numbers that you provided? David Cordani : Ricky, I appreciate your framing. Clearly there's a lot of scenarios. In close there's uncertainty, so we agree on both. I don't think it's constructive to take multiple different hypothetical's and then try to pinpoint how an individual lever would move within that scenario in a given point in time, but we recognize and I appreciate your framing, there are multiple scenarios that exist. Our view is that is we've played through a variety of scenarios and a variety of sensitivity tests in understanding what we have within our control running our business that the reaffirmation of our EPS as well as our revenue outlook is appropriate for 2020. And as I noted to the prior questions, the leverage we have within our control, as we best understand the environment right now for 2021 that that target is also appropriate and achievable for a corporation from that standpoint. The last thing I would say is the whole notion relative to a second surge or otherwise, we've seen elevated experiences now that society is adjusting to and we would expect to see further adjustments in both clinical protocols, community protocols, the way in which businesses operate from a more flexible standpoint and we would expect to see further accelerated evolution of treatments ideally beginning to be introduced to the market in the second half of this year as well, but having said that, we continue to believe that our outlook for 2020 is an appropriate outlook and a seeable outlook for us. Operator : Thank you for your question Miss. Goldwasser. Our next question is from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir. Robert Jones : Great, thanks for the questions. I guess just following up on the Health Services segment, the retention rate you guys laid out obviously looks pretty solid as you think about 2021. I'm just curious how this selling season in its early has progressed just given, I can only imagine payers are doing benefit managers or debt payers are dealing with a lot of other distractions right now. So wondering if that's adding to maybe a reluctance to explore switching? And then conversely do you think because of those dynamics that there might be less opportunity this year for net new wins, just given that the retention rates across the board might in fact be higher. Thanks. David Cordani : Good morning, Robert, it's David. So let me frame that in two dimensions, Health Services and then a little bit of walk over to Integrated Medical. But specific Health Services, we're delighted, we're pleased with the strength and we would view the 96% to 98% expectation for retention rate yet again for 2021 to be really, really strong. Now that's delivered with \u2013 as a result of sustained strong service delivery, sustained strong pharmacy cost delivery and ongoing innovation. And wrapping around that the team could be consultative in working with our clients. Specific to that retention rate, I would remind you that first, you should expect that the health plan portfolio business, those renewals largely complete and largely completed before the spike of COVID-19. So I would not correlate that result to a passivity or reluctance of people to evaluate the marketplace. Secondly, the large corporates within that portfolio, also more meaningfully renew on the earlier side of the timeline versus not. Now bridging to your comment, this disruptive environment, I think creates a higher hurdle rate, all other things remaining equal for a corporation or a benefits manager to introduce even more disruption to their world. I think that's a basic solid tenet to take place because of so much disruption. However, we still see business moving and that comment carries from Health Services across the Integrated Medical because at its core, employers in the case of this comment now are still looking for differentiated value and being able to bring them whether it's an innovative offering or a coordinated Health Service offering they can deliver innovative step function value, that affordability, predictability and simplification is even more important today, but all things remain equal. I think your basic tenet is right from this point going forward. In terms of the selling season, there's a bit of a higher hurdle to get across. I just wouldn't draw that conclusion up against the Health Service renewal of 96 to 98% because so much of that was then completed before the spike of the epidemic. Robert Jones : Got it, thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Jones. Our next question is from Josh Raskin with Nephron. Your line is open, sir. Josh Raskin : Thanks. Good morning. Question around the 2020 guidance confirmation here and there were a bunch of positives, including some favorable development, the tax benefits, something in the International around the accounting change, share buybacks et cetera. And yet, I haven't heard anything on the call that talks about pressures from COVID outweighing the benefits from delayed services and things like that and maybe less impact. So I'm just curious, is it just more appropriate to confirm guidance or am I sort of missing something and maybe the economic impact and lost membership we should be considering more seriously. David Cordani : Hey, Josh, good morning, it's David. I appreciate the way you frame the question. So point one is really strong start to the year. Fundamentals are strong across multiple of our business portfolios. And as in the case in most quarters, there were some items that you could call out is potentially being non-run ratable. Point two, within our International business there was a large favorable item that came through that aided further the strong fundamentals within the business. Having said that, we believe the outlook is both appropriate, achievable and prudent given that we're a bit ahead of our own expectations and the Street's expectations in the first quarter, given the uncertainty that exists in the latter part of the year. So strong fundamentals, top line, bottom line aided by some items that are non-run ratable and take the International item as an example, but added to a strong quarter within International. And as we take it all into consideration, we think it's prudent to maintain our EPS outlook at this point in time, given the uncertainty and potential puts and takes in the second half of the year. Josh Raskin : Okay, so nothing specific you would point to as a major headwind. David Cordani : That is correct, Josh. Josh Raskin : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Raskin. Our next question is from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open, sir. Scott Fidel : Thanks. Hey, guys. Good to have some unique insights into the impact of COVID on the business for a bit of a more extended period due to your exposures to Asia and some of the key markets that have been impacted there. So interested if you can talk a bit about what you're seeing more recently in some of the Asian businesses as those economies have started to open back up at different levels and specifically just around consumer behaviors, both as they relate to some of the sales trends of your products and then on how you're seeing healthcare utilization sort of track a bit later into \u2013 in some of these markets that have already been experiencing COVID for longer than we have. David Cordani : Hey, Scott, good morning, it's David. I'll grab that. And if I missed anything, I'll ask Eric to add to. Great question, so stepping back as you articulate we're global Health Service company, so we did have an early look into the COVID-19 dynamic, including our own co-workers in Wuhan. It's a city where we had a meaningful number of co-workers. I highlight two specific learnings that we're able to take starting from that, but not limited to that and carrying it forward. And then I'll give you a little bit on your specific question relative to the medical cost a little bit more difficult. Point one is we're able to learn and everybody's learning how to dynamically flex a global workforce pretty darn rapidly into a work at home environment. But not just a simple work in home environment, a work in home environment with the technology, infrastructure, connectivity and then workflows to keep the execution transpiring not just in terms of the base of the business, but ongoing innovation, some of the creative work that needs to transpire from that standpoint. Second, indisputably, we're able to learn and retest the imperative around public private partnership. In every country we operate in, you see, the public private partnership is being integral to being able to respond to this from worksite management, to workers safety, to testing access, testing protocols, to treatment, to community support, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So we saw that in country after country after country, which we'd like to believe that helped us be in position in the United States to be able to expect that proactively reach out for that and engage. As it relates to the medical cost dynamic, we see more of that through our global employer businesses covering the globally mobile population. It's a large business, but it's thin across the globe. So you see really small snippets and bytes of that everywhere, as opposed to a density of that, broadly speaking from that standpoint. And my final comment would be, even in the markets that had the earliest onset we see consumer behavior coming back pretty rapidly, quite rapidly as it relates to the activation of the consumer, from a social interaction standpoint, to the consuming services to the sale process, including your individual sale process. Eric, anything to add? Eric Palmer : David, I think you hit the headlines pretty effectively there, so nothing else to add at this point. David Cordani : Thanks, Scott. Scott Fidel : Yeah, thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Fidel. Our next question is from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open, sir. Steve Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good morning, David and Eric, and thanks for taking the question. So similar to many of your managed care peers, you mentioned in your prepared remarks your expectation of lower healthcare utilization in the second quarter, then elevated in the back half of 2020. By using the word elevated, I guess, just to clarify, are you expecting and budgeting for now that overall healthcare utilization would be above historical averages at some point in the back half of this year as there's a catch up of deferred care, or just elevated versus lower 2Q trends and then basically returning back to normal trends from before any COVID-19? I think there's still some mixed views among investors just on the magnitude of healthcare utilization bounce back in the back half of 2020. Thanks. Eric Palmer : Yeah, Steve, it's Eric. I'll start here. Overall, I think step to recognize this is a bit unprecedented, right. So stepping into this, I think the things we've been looking at here are, one, it's a pretty different set of dynamics across different geographies. So I think understanding the path and approach across different geographies and how this plays out across different geographies. I would just note, I think there'll be variations there. As the COVID impact, certainly been more impactful in some geographies than others. I think that will lead to more disruption in some geographies than in others, so to start with that one. Two, I think we would view that there will be some things that are deferred out of the second quarter, as I noted in my prepared remarks that will come into the back half of the year. Now, I don't think it'll necessarily be one for one. I mean, in terms of all of the things that were deferred from the second quarter are occurring in the third and fourth quarters, but it's appropriate to think of at least some of those coming back in the back half of the year. And as we continue to progress through this, we'll be working to refine our estimates and PTO posted as we think about it. David, I don't know what else you'd add there. David Cordani : Yeah, I agree with your comments for sure. I would remind you, Steven, specifically for our business, I ask you to remember 85% of our commercial business is ASO. So our employer clients are seeing and aligned with what we're experiencing from that standpoint. And even when you carry that forward to our MA portfolio, today, approximately 85% of our MA customers are in a value based relationship with the healthcare system from that standpoint. And then a final thought is we need to think about the capacity, right, the healthcare systems capacity to either get back to its prior level of utilization service fulfillment versus a massive uptick in that over a short period of time, and I don't mean that in a coded way, we need to recognize the fact that our healthcare delivery system is taxed right now. Different dimensions of it are taxed, but some facilities are redeploying surgeons and otherwise who are not doing deferrable procedures in doing triage procedures or virtual care from that standpoint. So as Eric noted a lot of uncertainty here, but important for us we're aligned with our employer clients, and they'll see the benefits of that aggregate cost experience in the first half of the year and a bit more reversion in the second half of the year based upon the scenarios we're operating with right now. Steve Valiquette : Just a very quick follow up on that, I mean, some of your peers have provided ranges on what percent of total medical spend they deem as either non-emergent or elective. Some have also discussed how much that elective care is declining on a percent basis, either in late March or in April. Are you able to share your views on these metrics and trends based on what you're seeing right now? Eric Palmer : Scott, its Eric, some of our \u2013 some of the most effective markets, you could see care deferrals or reduction in cost of as much as 30% for the first few weeks in April. Steve Valiquette : Okay, that's perfect. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question Mrs. Valiquette. Our next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. Your line is open, sir. David Windley : Hi, thank you for taking my questions and good morning. You've commented about certainly kind of COVID slash recession impacting membership and that being one of the variables that you are looking at certainly. I'm wondering if \u2013 to what extent you are already feeling that and if that is a reason for the relatively slow growth in selecting a middle market membership in the first \u2013 here at the end of the first quarter. If that is true or is there another reason in what would that be? Thank you. Eric Palmer : Okay. Hey, David, it's Eric. I'll start and then ask David if he wants to add anything else on here. And overall, broadly, I wouldn't point to the current COVID pandemic as a driver in terms of the membership results, we reported from a first quarter perspective overall. And again, just stepping back a little bit, we note we're really pleased with the continued customer growth in the Select segment. So on a year-on-year basis up about 10% in terms of now versus where we were a year ago. We've talked about it in a lot of different settings. This is a business that grows continuously throughout the year, right. So we've got pretty consistent growth quarter in quarter out to get good momentum there, I mean, on a year-on-year basis as well you're up a bit in mid market, so it's again, you're pretty consistent performance there. So again I wouldn't point to any disruption in the first quarter actual as we as we think about the pandemic dynamic at any broad scale. David, what else would? David Cordani : Yeah, the only thing I'd add is \u2013 just reaffirm the point which I think is sometimes maybe lost is the Select segment ramps throughout the course of the year. And we can see the value proposition and the complicated offering we have in that space is resonating quite well. David Windley : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Windley. Our last question will come from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Mr. Rhyee, your line is open. Charles Rhyee : Yeah, thanks. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, most of my questions have been answered. David, in the beginning, you talked about some of the efforts you're doing particularly in virtual care with MDLIVE and you guys were one of the first to launch a digital formulary for employers to look at and obviously the \u2013 and particularly virtual care has really come to the forefront here as \u2013 obviously, the nation practices social distancing and et cetera. Can you maybe talk about sort of what the interest in uptick of the formulary has been coming I guess, into this year? And then what kind of response you've been able to provide for clients using this in the middle of the pandemic? And the last I guess, related to that when I looked at it, it's really kind of about diabetes care and mental health. Telehealth itself wasn't on it maybe is that a distinction that you kind of make when you're constructing the formulary, any thought there would also be helpful. Thanks. David Cordani : Charles. Good morning. Let me try to kind of compartmentalize your question here. So I think you're building a little bit of an off the digital formulary and then you referenced the telehealth services et cetera. So maybe stepping back, the digital formulary was an innovative offering, is an example of one of many innovative offerings I should say, where we're trying to seek to help our clients, meaning corporate customers and health plans as they seek to utilize that as well as our customers in terms of making more informed decisions. So the digital formulary has a specific purpose to take the curate and digital applications that are out there to 300,000 plus and growing and try to evaluate them against specific criteria. More broadly inferred in your statement, which I agree with is society at large has been aggressively ramping appetite for more personalized, simplified, convenient ways of accessing services, information and increasingly care. So with telehealth wasn't that long ago that I think we as a society would be using telehealth as a small slice of triage intervention. And the COVID-19 epidemic is reinforcing to us it could be a larger portion of an overall integrated or coordinated healthcare offering. And we see that as a big part of both today and the future. We like our positioning both partnering as well as having proprietary capabilities. And as I noted, we were the first to offer annual checkups. We brought to market a dental capability, et cetera, around that. And then lastly, just wrapping the example around it, with the Buoy Health capability that we're able to bring to market very rapidly is another way of harnessing both through partnership, but putting the customer or patient front and center and providing an actionable, virtual tool with which to assess oneself and make informed decisions going forward from that standpoint. So big picture is we see a re-envisioning of what we call the front end of care, the way in which individuals access both information as well as the care system as having a tremendous opportunity to harness new technologies, tools and capabilities, which start with virtualization, and carrying that through a part of the coordinated care delivery system. And we like our positioning by not being tethered to or beholden to whether it's bricks-and-mortar or care fulfillment resources that will be in conflict with that. And the appetite right now is high and the satisfaction level from consumers who are experiencing that is quite high. And we think that will grow going forward. Charles Rhyee : David, if I could quickly follow up, can you maybe give us a sense on sort of the decision tree in your mind in which of these capabilities that you want to own such as like Buoy Health versus ones that you want to partner with like MDLIVE and I guess particularly telehealth my assumption has been utilization relatively has been until now fairly low. So the decision is easier to say we'd rather partner with somebody doing it, but is there a point when you would even look at telehealth and say this is a capability we want to have in house? Thanks. David Cordani : So fair question, I'd say stay tuned for more, but to give you a little bit of framing relative to it. We do some telehealth today on our own platform, so the Cigna Medical Group out in Arizona today is fulfilling approximately 80% of all our patient experiences today through either telephony or video interaction and less than 20% of their fulfillment is taking place through physical interaction during the COVID environment, so we can see that firsthand. Secondly, we've co-developed telehealth capability with some of our more advanced value based healthcare partners in certain markets, having said that, we have successfully partnered on scale. Bigger picture, expect to see us be oriented around at a minimum, the IP or Intellectual Property, the data, the data management, the data algorithms, the predictive capability to deliver the personalization, the clinical quality, we're going to be more oriented around that and then open architected to own some and then partner with some in very different ways to be able to bring it to the marketplace to offer the respective choice. Hope that helps? Operator : Thank you so much for your question Mr. Rhyee. I'll now turn the conference back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : Thank you. And thanks everyone for joining our call today. I want to start by acknowledging again the tireless efforts of all the frontline workers of the COVID-19 crisis for their selfless and caring nature for the patients that they're servicing. From Cigna's perspective, as we lead through this crisis, we will continue to attend to the needs of our stakeholders across the globe, work to maintain a healthy organization that is well positioned to deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders both today as well as into the future and ensure that we work to be a proactive part of the solution, partnering in both national and local levels. Relative to our performance, our team achieved strong results in the first quarter, through focused execution of our business strategies and by continuing to expand our key relationships and partnerships and working to make healthcare more affordable, predictable and simple. This fuels our expectations of delivering sustained, attractive top line and bottom line growth in 2020 and continuing this growth in 2021. With that, we thank you for joining the call. We wish you safety and health during these challenging times for both you and your family members and we look forward to future discussions.

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter the queue to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference including the Q&A session is being recorded. We will begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell. Will McDowell : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's second quarter 2020 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2020. As noted in our earnings release when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations, and adjusted revenues which are not determined in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income, and total revenues respectively is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled Adjusted Income from Operations and Adjusted Earnings per Share on this same basis as our principle measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2020 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the second quarter we recorded an after tax special item charge of $99 million or $0.27 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. We also recorded a special item charge of $11 million after tax, or $0.03 per share for cost associated with the early extinguishment of debt. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of financial results. Also, as we previously noted, prior year development is now disclosed on a gross basis, consistent with industry practice. Our financial supplement now includes a go-forward of year-to-date unpaid medical claims liability for the six months ended June 30, 2020, and 2019, as well for full-year 2019. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance including our full-year 2020 outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future share repurchases. Finally, our outlook for 2020 assumes a full-year of earnings from Cigna's group disability and life business. We continue to expect our divestiture of that business to be completed in the third quarter of 2020. And with that, I will turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks, Will, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. The current environment that we all live in and work in is more dynamic, more unsettled, and more complex than any time in recent history, and Cigna's mission to improve the health, wellbeing, and peace of mind of those we serve has never been more important, and it continues to guide the actions as we move forward. In recent weeks and months, we have taken decisive steps to support employers who are the driving force of a thriving economy to withstand and emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, and to support our communities, customers, and patients, including our efforts to combat systemic racism, which we view as a critical health issue as a well. Today, I'll offer several recent examples of how we continue to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and with our key stakeholders by delivering on our promises and working to make healthcare more affordable, predictable, and simple by creating innovative solutions to solve for healthcare's most complex challenges and by partnering with our clients, some of whom are viewed as competitors, but who we see as strategic partners capable of extending our reach to making even greater impact for customers around the globe. We view all of this with the goal of maintaining and improving the health and vibrancy of our clients, communities, and customers. I will also give you an update on our financial results that we delivered for the quarter, and how these results provide a further testament to the strength of our businesses and the value we create for our customers and clients, as well as a few comments on our growth path forward, and then, I will conclude with a brief update on our outlook before turning the call over to Eric. Cigna's longstanding commitment to our clients, communities, and customers is fundamental to who we are as a global health service company, and it has been critical in shaping our ongoing response to COVID-19 crisis. This response begins with our more than 70,000 colleagues around the globe, who worked tirelessly and with great empathy throughout this pandemic. They wake up each and every day with the sole focus to serve the needs of our customers, patients, and clients around the globe, and I am proud to be teamed up with such a talented group of co-workers, and I thank them for what they do to positively impact millions of lives each and every day. Nowhere is their commitment more evident than in their deep support of our employer clients; large, small, public, private. These businesses have always been critical to a robust economy, and today more than ever companies will play an essential role in serving individuals, reenergizing their communities and returning economies around the world to economic vibrancy. From the outset of the COVID-19 crisis, Cigna's leverage of breadth of solution, strength of our team, and a consultative approach in our broad data and analytical capabilities to support our employer clients and their employees in numerous ways from taking rapid and decisive steps to eliminate cost as a barrier to testing and treatment, to expanding to access to care, to helping them safely work to return their employees to worksites, most recently, for example, with the launch of our COVID-19 high risk dashboard. This new suite of innovative analytical tools combines the power of data, predictive models, and clinical expertise to help clients project how COVID-19 might impact the health and safety of their employee populations, and to model forward impacts of different pandemic scenarios going forward. For example, the dashboard compiles and analyzes COVID-19 case data on the health of that client-specific employees at national, state, and county levels, giving them essential insights to guide their decision-making for bringing employees back to work safely. In cases, where employers see concerning trends in the reports, Cigna is prepared to help them take action. For instance, through routes like COVID-19 testing and triage services delivered from on our Cigna onsite health solutions. Our COVID-19 high risk taskforce represents just one powerful example of how Cigna is helping employers navigate the complexities of the pandemic, and serves as a reinforcement of why employers rank Cigna highest amongst its competitors for driving healthcare quality and value as reported in a recent study conducted by The Leapfrog Group, an independent national organization representing employers. Turning to our support of communities where we live, work, and play each and every day, our commitment is reflected in our efforts to increase understanding of the impacts of, and to drive positive changes to combat systemic racism, and only is systemic racism an issue of human rights, we also view it as a critical health issue, contributing to well-documented disparities in health treatment and outcomes that disproportionately impact communities of color. Two weeks ago, we launched our new five-year initiative, our building equity and equality program, which commits a mix of local community grants, scholarship funds, and employee volunteer hours to continue to drive Cigna's efforts to eliminate racism, bias, and health and economic disparities for people of color. This new initiative is another important part of Cigna's ongoing commitment to partner with our communities and government leaders to effect positive sustainable change, and we will continue to expand and evolve our engagement programs going forward. All of Cigna's efforts to partner with our clients and communities is ultimately rooted in our mission to improve the health wellbeing and peace of mind of those we serve, specifically focused on customers and patients. Today, more than ever, they are looking for us to make healthcare more affordable, predictable and simple. We continue to introduce new innovative programs and solutions designed to deliver on this promise. For example, our Customer Protection Program, which safeguards our customers from unexpected costs from COVID-19 through surprise or balance bills from out-of-network providers. In addition, our pharmacy solutions leverage existing and newly-created tools to put resources and medicines and treatments in the hands of those who need the most. For example, we help Americans who lose their prescription coverage from recent job loss to secure their medications at affordable predictable prices through our Express Scripts Parachute Pharmacy Program. Further, as demonstrated by our most recent drug term report, we also delivered affordability and predictability to our health service customers and clients, who in 2019, experienced an overall rate of increase of drug spending of just 2.3%, a result that is in line with the Consumer Price Index, and important to note, more than one-third of our commercial plans experienced a decrease in overall spending in 2019. Taken altogether these examples I've shared with you today are reflective of how Cigna is and will continue to deliver on our promises, create innovative solutions, and partner effectively to further reach and drive impact. Now turning briefly to our results, we once again delivered strong financial performance in this quarter, and we remain on track to complete our integration and reach our deleveraging objectives by year-end. Our consolidated revenue is $39.2 billion, and after tax earnings of $2.2 billion reflect continued strong execution of our strategy and the fundamental strength of our four well-positioned diversified growth platforms. In particular, the continued strong performance of our Health Service segment demonstrates the range of services and value we provide to diverse health plan, employer, federal and state government clients. Our Integrated Medical segment results reflect lower consumption of medical services, as individuals have deferred some services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, integrated medical customers continue to track much better than the national unemployment figures, as many employers have maintained benefits through this disruptive time, and importantly, because our client mix is less weighted to industries that have been most impacted by COVID-19. As our employer clients have continued to support their employees' health and wellness needs, we've provided hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance to our employer clients, both through direct financial support and by leveraging our flexibility of our full suite of funding alternatives, all of which are already reflected in our second quarter results. I would also note that our self-funded medical clients have directly benefited from well in excess of $2 billion of reduced spending this year. Overall, I'm pleased that by maintaining the strength and health of our franchise, we've effectively balanced and responded to the needs of our stakeholders in this challenging environment. Now, to bring my comments to a close, the current environment we live in and work in is highly dynamic, unsettled and complex, and as I noted, more than any time in recent history. Cigna's strong second quarter results reflected continued strong execution of our strategy and the underlying strength of our four well-positioned diverse growth platforms. We have confidence that we will continue to effectively support our clients, communities, customers and patients, all while working to deliver on our EPS and revenue outlook for 2020, as well as our 2021 EPS target of $20 to $21 per share. This is driven by our sustained culture of innovation in our organization, the value we deliver to the marketplace each and every day, and aided by the financial strength and flexibility of our franchise. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Eric. Eric Palmer : Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. First, we've recognized that the current environment is even more dynamic, disrupted and complex than usual as we navigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and I'm proud of the many ways that Cigna has responded as we drive to be the champions for affordable, predictable, and simple health care. Today, I will review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter results, including the impact of COVID-19 on our business and discuss our outlook for the full-year. Regarding our second quarter consolidated results a few key financial highlights include adjusted revenue of $39.2 billion, adjusted earnings of $2.2 billion after tax, adjusted earnings per share of $5.81, and continued strong operating cash flow of $3.3 billion. Within the second quarter, we continue to execute on the fundamentals of our businesses as we deliver value for customers and clients. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on health services. Second quarter adjusted revenues grew 22% to $29 billion, and adjusted pre-tax earnings grew 7% to $1.2 billion. These results were driven by growth and customer event script volumes, favorable impacts from supply chain initiatives, strong specialty performance as our leading Accredo's specialty pharmacies proactively work with patients with complex and chronic conditions to maintain continuity of care for their medications, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses to support growth. We fulfilled $364 million adjusted pharmacy scripts in the second quarter of 2020, an increase of 24% over a second quarter 2019, driven by the in-sourcing of integrated medical script volumes and strong organic growth, partially offset by somewhat lower retail network scripts related to acute needs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, health services delivered another strong quarter as we continue to deliver value for our customers and clients. Turning to our Integrated Medical Segment, second quarter adjusted revenues were $9 billion and adjusted pre-tax earnings were $1.5 billion. In the quarter, we experienced significantly lower utilization of medical services in both commercial and government as individual deferred care due to the pandemic. By month compared to baseline expectations, utilization was 30% to 35% lower in April, 20% to 25% lower in May, and closer to normal in June at approximately 0% to 5% lower. We also experienced strong customer retention as our clients' maintained coverage for furloughed employees and our commercial book of business less weighted to the most economically impacted industries. In response to the pandemic and the tremendous burden is placing on those reserve, we are financially supporting our customers and clients. There are a series of actions including early on waiving all cost sharing for COVID-19 testing and treatment and for Medicare Advantage and individual and family plans additionally, waiving cost sharing for in office and telehealth visits for primary care, specialty care, and behavioral health. Additionally, we've provided premium relief programs for clients and financial assistance programs to support providers. All in our results for the quarter include approximately $270 million of charges related to these initiatives. It's also important to note that we serve 85% of Cigna's U.S. commercial customers through self-funded arrangements. And as such, our medical cost performance is highly aligned with our clients, who have seen savings well in excess of $2 billion year-to-date related to deferred medical costs. Turning to our international markets business, second quarter adjusted revenues were $1.4 billion and adjusted pre-tax earnings were $319 million, reflecting deferred medical utilization primarily in our global health benefits business. Claims volumes as well as sales activities increased throughout the quarter as global economies reopened. For our Group Disability and Other Operations segment, second quarter adjusted revenues were $1.3 billion. Second quarter adjusted pre-tax earnings for the segment were $132 million, reflecting elevated life claims primarily due to the pandemic partially offset by favorable performance and disability. Overall, our businesses remained focused and delivered strong performance in the second quarter as we work to rapidly innovate to serve our customers and patients in this disruptive environment. Now, looking forward to our outlook for the full-year, we continue to focus on driving strong performance across our businesses to continue to be able to improve the health wellbeing, and peace of mind of those we serve. Aided by our strong and diverse portfolio of businesses, we continue to expect full-year 2020 consolidated adjusted revenues in the range of $154 billion to $156 billion, and we continue to expect to deliver full-year adjusted earnings per share in the range of $18 to $18.60. As we look to the balance of the year, we expect medical utilization to increase. We expect additional COVID-19 treatment costs, and we expect lower enrollment as well as continued lower net investment income, due to recessionary pressures. Inside in our guidance, we considered a range of scenarios regarding the rate and pace of the return of medical utilization, as well as the rate and pace of the reopening of the U.S. and global economies and subsequent impact on employment and customer levels. Our ability to deliver in a range of scenarios, underscores the strength and diversity of our portfolio of businesses, which continue to deliver solutions directly aligned with marketplace needs. We will continue to dynamically manage our businesses, ensuring that we are delivering on the fundamentals and meeting our customer's needs, while also continuing to provide financial support to our customers and clients in a thoughtful and deliberate manner. Taken as a whole, we continue to expect full-year consolidated adjusted earnings per share in the range of $18 to $18.60. I would remind you that our financial outlook excludes the impact of future share repurchases and assumes a full-year of contributions from a group disability and life business, although, we continue to expect our divestiture of that business to close in the third quarter. Overall, these expected results are driven by strong underlying fundamentals and disciplined expense management and deployment of capital. Now, moving to our 2020 capital and liquidity position and outlook, our capital efficient businesses, generate a substantial amount of cash flow, which provides us with significant capital and financial flexibility. In the second quarter, we generated $3.3 billion of cash flows from operations, due to strong fundamental as well as the timing impact of approximately $900 million of delayed tax payments permitted under the CARES Act. Through the end of second quarter, we also deployed $1.1 billion to debt repayment. And on a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased $8.3 million shares of stock for $1.5 billion. For 2020, we continue to expect greater than $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well performing businesses. And as of June 30th, we had $1.7 billion of cash available at the parent. Finally, we remain on track to close the sale of our group disability and life business in the third quarter, generating $5.3 billion in net proceeds, which we expect to deploy the share repurchase and debt repayment in 2020. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 43.5% as of June 30th, an improvement of 170 basis points from December 31st of 2019, and we remain on track to return on debt-to-capitalization ratio to the upper 30s by the end of 2020. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and returns on capital. Now to recap, through the exceptionally dynamic and disruptive environment associated with COVID-19, Cigna has remained intensely focused on delivering affordability, predictability, and simplicity for the benefit of our customers, patients, and all of our stakeholders. We're fully committed to helping create vibrant, diverse, high performing communities, whether through partnerships with our employer, health plan or government clients with our provider partners, or with our customers directly. We've delivered strong fundamental performance this year. We'll also see lower medical costs from deferred care, and we continue to provide financial support to our clients and customers. We expect our strong fundamentals across our diverse portfolio of growth businesses to enable us to manage through the various impacts of the current environment, and as such, we continue to expect 2020 full-year adjusted EPS of $18, $18.60 per share, and remain on track to deliver on our target of $20 to $21 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021. With that, I'll turn it over to the Operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. You may ask your question. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Thanks, good morning. I guess can you just give us a sense of your conversations with existing employer customers an appetite, if any, for sort of revisiting funding scenarios? I think in the past, you've talked about shared return models, any of that resonating, and then ASR enrollment was down slightly, but you had a more pronounced decline in fees, can you just help reconcile that, and if that's at all related to some of those changing in those funding scenarios would be helpful? David Cordani : Ralph, good morning. It's David. I'll take the first part, and I will ask Eric to take the second part of your question. At a macro level, yes to what you stated at the first part of your question. So, a lot of dynamic interaction back and forth with employer clients is a regular part of our business, even more elevated in the current environment, a lot of proactive engagement in the change relative to maximizing value for them through using our broad array of alternative funding mechanisms, and even the intra-year conversation, given the uniqueness how this year is playing out bringing more choice to clients. So, yes, continuation of we see it as a strength and continue to see movement in the use of funding mechanisms to best align ourselves with employers, and that plays to a strength of our company. I'll ask Eric to comment on the second piece relative to the fee dynamic. Eric Palmer : Yes, Ralph. It's Eric. I would note two items as it relates to the fee dynamics; first and most significantly, we had a reclassification of certain revenues that we implemented actually back at the beginning of the year, so effective January 1st. That did not have an impact on the P&L, but it reduced revenues and has an exact offset in lower SG&A as well. So, that's showing up in the comparison of this year versus last year, and second, as you know, we did see some declines in self-funded enrollment, but just think that is consistent with the impact of COVID-19 and the economic environment overall. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. Our next question comes from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Matthew Borsch : Yes, thank you. Maybe if I could ask about the utilization trends that you're seeing. I assume that, you talked to a fairly steep decline in April; I'm curious how you saw the month of June, and then coming into July, given the surge of cases in the Southeast and West, how that has affected your view of trend? Eric Palmer : Yes, Matt. It's Eric. I will give you a couple of perspectives here. As I noted in my prepared remarks, and we saw the decline of 30% to 35% back in April, and utilization is uptick since then. You've called out geography, and that's a really important dimension here is looking at this play out market-by-market and having the local perspective is important, and we're certainly seeing this play out different rates and phases in different geographies. As I noted also in the prepared remarks, we saw June at much closer to normal level of utilization. I'd say our early indicators for July are pretty consistent with June. So, still some impacts moving through different geographies, but at this point, we'd say July looks an awful lot like June. Matthew Borsch : And have you seen in the Northeast as things have settled there, are you seeing evidence of flow-through of deferred electives and pent-up demand is there, can you see signs of temporary period of higher than normal trends coming in the wake of this? Eric Palmer : I wouldn't call anything out on that yet, Matt. I think again, our outlook for the full-year does assume some additional utilization coming in the back-half of the year, but I think it'd be too early to say that we've seen anything like that within the second quarter. Matthew Borsch : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to focus on the PBM here. Specifically, two things; one, your first-half growth has been significantly ahead of at least the initial guidance for the full-year. So, by my math, it implies, you know, about 3% growth in the back-half versus about 8% growth in the first-half. So I'm just curious, I know you haven't updated in the guide, so do you expect this first-half performance to be indicative of the full-year, or not with the kind of swing factors first-half to the second-half? And then also your scripts are running kind of better than I think a lot of people would have expected, given the slowdown in scripts in the second quarter overall, so can you give us some color there, and maybe any color on kind of mail order mix in the second quarter and the kind of profitability drivers there? Thanks. Eric Palmer : Hi, Justin. It's Eric. Good morning. So, on the first part of your question for the health services and kind of the pattern of the earning, we just step back, the normal pattern for this business is for income to grow throughout the year, as you know, just reflects the overall utilization patterns, and our efforts to manage the supply chain, and we think that will continue to play out throughout the course of 2020. Now I'll remind you, in 2019, the pattern was a little bit extra weighted towards the back-half of the year just given the timing of the supply chain initiatives. So, when you are comparing 2020 to 2019, you'll see that the impact of that kind of play out to the year. We think of 2020 as being more of a normal pattern this year. We think of 2019 was a little bit backend weighted. So, that'd be the biggest dynamic I'd call out as it relates to the pattern. Now, as it relates to the script volumes, overall, we're executing very well and very much in line with the pattern that we had expected to play itself out. As I noted back at our call a quarter-ago, we did see, or we estimated to be about five million scripts get refilled a little earlier that moved from the second quarter into the first quarter, and since that played out, and additionally we've seen nice utilization within our home delivery pharmacy. There's a lot of benefits to the mail order pharmacy and such for our customers and clients. We've seen that adoption continue to be good, but again, nothing else I'd call out in terms of major dynamics. Justin Lake : Great. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. I want to ask about the commercial membership trends, I guess that you're thinking about for the back-half of the year, I appreciate that, you mentioned that furloughs has impacted as well as your customer exposure, but just maybe if you go down to both of those a little bit, have you had any conversations with clients about membership at risk from furloughs just to sign kind of size, what that might mean in the back-half of the year, and then the comment about being less exposed to the markets most impacted by COVID, are you seeing a differential in trend, or are you seeing those customers in the segments you expect to be impacted seeing larger declines in enrollment already versus the other sectors? So, any color there? David Cordani : Kevin, good morning. It's David. So, let me try to paint the 2020 picture, and then maybe even bleed in a little bit of comments in terms of how we expect to unfold beyond that going into 2021. So, first and foremost, a significant amount of interaction with clients, always part of our consultative approach, elevated even further in the current environment and the dynamism. So, we're looking at this as best we can through a client-by-client framework. As we noted previously, a high percentage of clients have maintained benefits either through the use of the word that we talk about is furloughs or layoffs with benefit continuity taking place, and I think that's a testament to how committed employers are to the health safety and wellbeing of their employees, and the optimism they continue to hold on to return employees back to work to keep their businesses running on a go-forward basis. As it relates to the second-half of the year, we expect the following : we expect to see those employees who are furloughed, or with continuity of benefits, we expect to see those furloughs dissipate or go away, and one or two things transpire either (a), no benefits for the employee and they transition to [indiscernible] or other alternatives, or (b), they return to full employment, and client-by-client, we're going through patterning of what the expectations are relative to that. Therefore, we expect to see the effect of lower levels of employment across our book continue throughout the second-half of the year, and that's fully factored into the outlook that Eric made reference to. And then finally, maybe at the most macro level, the way we're thinking about it is essentially over the next 18 months, second-half of '20 and 2021, we expect to see a slow recovery to the overall employment marketplace in the United States, and that's what's factored into our thinking, said otherwise, we expect to see pressure of through the second-half of this year and 2021 to what would otherwise be a normal course of business from a membership standpoint, and that's factored into our thinking for 2020 as well as 2021. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Go ahead, sir. Kevin Fischbeck : Do you have any color about the impact on the members, who are [indiscernible] impacted by COVID versus those [infected] [ph] that you don't see disrupted, any difference in trend there? David Cordani : Kevin, stay on the line. Are you asking the question of medical trend or employment dynamic? Kevin Fischbeck : Sorry. It's the employment dynamic. Second part of my question was, you know, are you seeing a differential in employment -- or job losses or in markets where you said that you have low exposure to those segments that are impacted by COVID, so just wanted to see if you are seeing any differential in the employment trends. David Cordani : The answer to that is absolutely yes. So, as we parse our business by sector, and then employer-by-employer, there is no doubt, there are some employers that are having either de minimis impact to their employee base as a result of COVID, or there are some factors that you're seeing actually the need for more employees, given the environment. So there is no doubt that the phenomenon we're talking about is incredibly uneven or unique not just to sector, but to employers within the sector. That's why our approach is a client-by-client approach, so yes to that portion, unequivocally high variability there. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser. Your line is open; from Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes, hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. David, going back to one of the comments in prepared remarks, you talked about partnering with some competitors, could you just share some details of the recent partnership with Oscar, how do you think about this developing, and I'm curious what is your appetite is for the exchange market? David Cordani : Ricky, good morning. So, appreciate you referencing the prepared remarks. My remarks said, of what some view is traditional competitors, we view as strategic partners. So stepping back, our philosophy has been we seek to be the undisputed partner of choice. And our view is that the ability to partner with others and work to create shared value presents an opportunity for mutual growth, which means more customers to serve in a larger impact. So, now stepping back, whether that's through an expanding portfolio of health plan clients through a health service portfolio, where we challenge ourselves to continue to bring additional innovations for the benefit of our health plan clients to help them deliver better affordability, better value and continue to grow or specifically to come to your question with Oscar. We have an exciting partnership with Oscar where we're bringing mutual capabilities to the table to bring some additional innovation to the small employer market, a marketplace that both organizations feel has been underserved as relates to benefiting from more innovative programs around health engagement, personalization, value based care, more comprehensive clinical engagement programs, and together we're going to be able to bring the best of both companies together. And at the later part of this year, we'll be opening up some additional markets where we're already quoting today, jointly, so the philosophy of the corporation is defined mutually aligned organizations where we could create leverage value together, and then pursue that and Oscar is a wonderful example of it. And actually, we had to check in with the team earlier this week, Eric and the team is working exceptionally well to get around the innovation here. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Goldwasser. Our next question comes from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. You can ask your question. Frank Morgan : Yes, just one question around the difference. Could you distinguish any difference in what you saw regarding deferrals into commercial versus the Medicare book? Thanks. Eric Palmer : Frank, this is Eric. With a pattern was with similar in terms of how we progress through time, we would note we saw more of a deferral percentage in the commercial book than what we saw in the Medicare Advantage book, but again, kind of the progression month-to-month has been pretty consistent, just more significant impact in the commercial business. Frank Morgan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Our next question comes from Whit Mayo with UBS. You may ask your question. Mr. Mayo, please check your mute feature. Whit Mayo : Sorry about that. Can you maybe -- I appreciate the question, can you maybe help us understand the impact of commercial leakage on the PBM? I'm just trying to crosswalk the two and think through what percent of your wrist members are with your PBM, and presumably, all the self-funded are, but I'm not sure that this is necessarily a one-to-one relationship. So any help would be great. And then also maybe just on the Medicaid enrollment that we're seeing sort of nationally. I know this isn't really impacting you per se, but maybe just the overall impact on the PBM given its exposure to Medicaid? David Cordani : Whit, it's David, can you repeat the first part of your question because Eric, and I didn't hear a couple of your words and we want to make sure we understand the query. Whit Mayo : Yes, I'm just trying to sort of cross walk the impact of commercial leakage. The declining commercial membership across risk and ASO how that impacts your PBM, and I think that the majority of your risk members are probably not with your -- with your PBM, and presumably the self-funded also I'm just trying to square the commercial leakage with the PBM? David Cordani : Great, I will ask Eric to take the first part of the question and I'll come back and take the second part of your question on Medicaid. Eric Palmer : Good morning, Whit. On the leakage, as you termed it, maybe step back the -- I think the way I think about that is we have a kind of spectrum across our different customer segments. So within our Select segment, offering, really think about all of our Select segments as having a comprehensive bundle of our services, so pharmacy, behavioral, disease, and care management et cetera, all tied together with stop loss and administration or in our fully insured product, but to that point, think about the Select segment as being effectively 100% penetrated with our pharmacy offering, as you move into the middle market segment, reasonably high degree of penetration there, but you see more buyers that have smaller cart offerings are purchasing and such we've provided some statistics on this at the past and some of our past Investor Day materials, but think about, you know, a meaningful portion but not all of the middle market is having purchased an integrated offering, which then flows to the PBM, and then that same dynamic holds through in the national segment, it's even more \u00e0 la carte, if you will, in terms of the pieces that are, but the I think about it more along the segment lines than I would around just kind of the funding on it is true that the insured business also carries a high degree of penetration, but I encourage you to think about it by segment David Cordani : And Whit relative to Medicaid, we currently serve very attractive portfolio of Medicaid relationships through a health service portfolio. As a result of our diversion, high performing health plan, portfolio businesses, we see that as growing. We've grown that successfully. Notwithstanding the COVID pandemic ramifications and looking forward, we see that as a continued growing base of an opportunity for us to expand into servicing the Medicaid population, but servicing them through the health service platform. Whit Mayo : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Mayo. Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with JP Morgan. You may ask your question. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. I have a two part question about your MLR expectations. And your -- I think relatively appropriate conservatism or, you know, caution as we head into the back-half, but the question is, now as you anticipate higher MLR in the back-half, is that explicitly from an expectation around the deferred electives coming through or around an expectation about higher acuity care being required because of necessary, you know, deferred care during the pandemic, and do you have any evidence around those? That's the first part. The second is just given where you stand on your three year rolling, commercial MLR minimum positions, if we don't see this, pick up some MLR transpire should we still can -- should we assume that in the second-half, there is still pretty substantial flow through of MLR EPS? Eric Palmer : Yes, Gary, this is Eric. So we'll take that one on a couple of different dimensions we've talked about there. First of all, stepping back, we expect a loss ratio to be somewhat elevated in the back-half of the year. Think about that as 150 to 200 basis points increase over what we previously would have expected for the second-half of the year. Not dimensioned that off a couple of things. One, we do think that there will be some deferred care utilization and the potential for higher acuity coming back in, and then, two, the ongoing effect of the programs we put in place to reduce co-payments or make care more accessible and affordable within quality drive of some additional utilization. I don't have a precise kind of identification of each of those components, but think about those as the biggest drivers for our outlets over the course of the back-half of the year. On the minimum MLR, as you know it's a three-year calculation for the minimum MLRs for the commercial business. So again, we generally speaking, do have a margin between where we are at and the minimum. Now I would know that we increased our accrual in the second quarter by $95 million, and we've got $175 million on the balance sheet for this as a provision at this point, and so it's something we watch, but would still know that there's across the board. Still a margin there before we did not see any of the impact kind of flows through the bottom-line. Gary Taylor : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Taylor. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. So, good morning, it's Josh here with [indiscernible] as well. What you see as more permanent changes as a result of the COVID pandemic, and what are you doing to make sure that Cigna is positioned to take advantage or capture those opportunities going forward? David Cordani : Josh, good morning. It's David. I'd identify two; one in terms of access, two, in terms of programmatic. As it relates to access, it's indisputable that the COVID pandemic has either required caused or pushed more utilization of technology as a mechanism to access care coordinate care et cetera. You recall that our view has been for some time that we believe a meaningful amount of care can be delivered through a combination of technology, you can call it tele, you call it virtual et cetera, but it needs to be highly coordinated care, and then, further augmented by in-home care that is also aided by technology. So one, we believe that the rate and pace of adoption and acceleration of reformatting care access, utilizing technology to coordinate care and deliver care in a personalized high-quality basis. And then augmenting it with re-envisioning what could take place in the home is mission critical and accelerated by COVID, that's on strategy for us, and we are aggressively investing in and innovating in those categories off of a variety of platforms. Secondly, a lot of what we talked about before. It's a little back to the future, but COVID re-highlights for all societies around the globe that as challenging as COVID is, it's exponentially more challenging for individuals who have chronic conditions or who are polychronic, so it presents another opportunity to engage with employers, with health policymakers and from a public health policy standpoint to make sure we're investing in and innovating programs with physicians and individuals to lower health risks or increase health quality for those who are chronic or polychronic because all things remaining equal, if you have a better health status, you're more likely to withstand COVID or the next generation, a decade from now and beyond, and that's an area where Cigna excels on our current state of basis in terms of what we're able to bring to bear from that standpoint, as well as with the health service portfolio, and then, putting up over that of COVID-19 highlights the mental health dimension that is, highlighted in societies around the globe, where the mental health and the physical health needs to come together to best manage overall wellbeing. So, reformatting, utilizing technology, chronic condition management and improving overall health risk and then taking mental health and the physical health together are all areas we see as being accelerated because of COVID and additional opportunities and areas that Cigna is heavily investing in. Josh Raskin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. You may ask your question. Lance Wilkes : Yes. Good morning guys. Just wanted to get your updated views on your strategic capital deployment priorities and in particular I was interested in, how you're prioritizing buybacks given the group sale, and then, if you've had any change in perspective or evolution involved in Medicaid, owning positions or other aspects of value-based care, and how you're looking at global now? David Cordani : Lance, good morning. It's David. I'm going to ask Eric to comment on the portion of your question specifically because of the uniqueness of the group sale, and then, I'll come back and talk about M&A priorities more broadly. Eric Palmer : Yes, Lance, good morning. So just on the group sales specifically, so first of all, we do expect that transaction to close within the third quarter reminder, we expect $5.3 billion of after-tax proceeds once that transaction closes, so that is coming in, in the relatively near-term. As we've talked about for some time now, we've had a goal of and are committed to obtaining a debt or achieving a debt-to-capital ratio of under 40% by the end of the year. We're driving towards that, and we've committed to deploying a significant amount of the proceeds from the group transaction to share repurchase to offset the dilution, the effect of the not having the group insurance business for a portion of the year. So again, at the most macro level, those are the pieces we're navigating. We do continue to fund significant organic growth; we continue to have capital investments to advance our capabilities, but definitely, we see share repurchase as a really excellent use of capital to drive shareholder value in the near-term, and the last thing I note is just add our recent board meeting, our board increased the share repurchase authorization consistent with our expectation of closing the New York Life transaction later this quarter. And as we sit here today, we have $4.4 billion of share repurchase authority outstanding. David Cordani : And Lance relative to the portfolio of businesses today and going forward. First to be clear, we like our portfolio in the strategic positioning and are pleased with its performance from a growth standpoint, from a service standpoint and from a capital and fiscal flexibility standpoint that portfolio is positioned to deliver sustained 6% to 8% revenue growth. As it relates to M&A priorities, we continue to remain focused on five specific M&A priorities; one, to further strategically and smartly over global footprint, second, to further enhance our U.S. seniors' capabilities, third, continue to broaden our digital and information capabilities, fourth, looking to continue to expand our care coordination capabilities, and five, as we've talked before, exploring state-based risk program capabilities as we see states who are under budgetary pressure for within their Medicaid programs, seek to further sub segment their programs and seek either high credit -- high cost complex critical programs to be able to perform on their behalf and deliver more value. So, we see opportunity going forward, but building off of a very strong base and low performing portfolio. Lance Wilkes : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Wilkes. Our next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Sandler. You may ask your question. Sarah James : Thank you. Can you talk about any slowdown that you've seen in the pace of receiving claims from the date of service, and then on your risk business, what impact that's made on your reserving policy or any impact to MLR? Thanks. Eric Palmer : Hi, Sarah, it's Eric. Broadly, I wouldn't call out any change in terms of impact. Since again nothing that would rise to being inevitable. With respect to our reserving approaches and policies has been very consistent, because the same team and the same approach to working through those calculations for some time, it served us really pretty well so I wouldn't note anything unusual here. Sarah James : But are you seeing a slowdown in claims, especially timing? Eric Palmer : No. Sarah James : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Ms. James. So our next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Just wondering some discussion about the selling season I'd seen in your press release; you're talking about in the health service division [indiscernible] I wonder, if you could just talk through a little bit what you're seeing for the 2021 selling season related to integrative medical and the health services division, how the COVID impact is on that process whether it slows it down or causes people to defer decisions, and if I could just slip in as well on the healthcare services division. And I know you're not seeing much attrition in the integrative medical, but how is the economic slowdown impacting the PBM side of the business, if at all? David Cordani : A.J., it's David. I'll take the selling season. I'll ask Eric to comment briefly on the year equivalent of its enrollment on the integrated medical what we're seeing on the health service portfolio. First broadly on the selling season, I appreciate you asked about multiple segments of business. Headline is well we're not guiding for 2021 yet, we will expect another year of attractive revenue growth for the franchise in 2021. For the health service portfolio that will be anchored in a third consecutive year of truly outstanding client retention, where our clients continue to reward us by staying with us and expanding the relationship because of the services we're delivering because of the continued innovation we're delivering, and because of the outstanding affordability or market trends we're delivering on their behalf. Before I jump over to Integrated Medical comments on Medicare Advantage, we would expect another year of attractive customer growth within our Medicare Advantage portfolio, and I will remind you we set a strategic objective to grow Medicare Advantage customers 10% to 15%. We're tracking well to that objective in 2020. We would expect to know the year of contribution in 2021, and specific to the Integrated Medical, our visibility in 2021 is largely through the national accounts at this point in time, and to remind you we defined that as commercial employers with 5,000 or more employees. We're a multi-state, at this point in time, we expect to see that tracking to a bit higher retention rate than recent past. And while we have some new business wins, we expect the new business wins to be a little less than recent past taken as a whole, probably performing a little better as we step into 2021 off of that portfolio, and then the middle market or regional and select segments are currently in the throes of their growth trajectories as we look into 2021. Wrapping it up, we would expect again another year of very attractive and profitable revenue growth for 2021. Eric, maybe just a little color on the health services dynamic of the equivalent disenrollment? Eric Palmer : Thanks, David, and good morning, A.J. So, on the health services business, again within the segment, I think we've talked about in the past we've got a really diversified book of business here with customers through a variety of channels and players that are helped play on government relationships, some direct programs and the like, we've had a really strong degree of client retention and we've had a high degree of continuity in terms of enrollment within those clients as well. So note in my prepared remarks, we did have a bit of a dip of retail acute scripts, especially earlier in the quarter, but that'd be really the only thing I would call out is particularly impactful. Overall, the enrollment levels within our clients and within our health plan clients have held up quite nicely. A.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rice. The next question comes from Stephen Tanal with SVB Leerink. You may ask your question. Stephen Tanal : Hey good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Maybe just one really quick follow-up on strategic M&A, and then an actual question, so I just want to understand what would you say we should expect with respect to the size of any future deals you might choose to do, and your willingness to do another large deal just following up on that question earlier, and I also just wanted to get your latest thoughts, obviously in the executive order last Friday order HHS to put out the rebate rule again, but it was conditioned on being able to demonstrate no increase in premium or really any kind of cost any payers, which looks pretty unlikely given the CBO scoring the first time around, but just given the prospect, I guess it'd be helpful if you could just remind us how to think about that rule and its potential effect on the economics of the PBM business and Medicare? That'd be helpful. Thank you. David Cordani : Sure, good morning. It's David. I'll take both questions. On the first question as I noted before, we're really pleased with the configuration of our business portfolio today and its performance. I'm not going to comment on size of assets. We've been quite disciplined over a long period of time relative to strategic alignment and financial alignment relative to assets we would pursue. And it would be inappropriate to say that there's an asset of the certain type or size from that standpoint that we would limit ourselves to. Specific to the executive order, stepping back; first, at the more macro level, we share the administration's objectives to further improve affordability of prescription drugs. There's no doubt about that and concrete examples, including we were the first to step into the need to reformat the diabetes and insulin environment with a patient insurance program that caps cost at $25 for 30-day supply. It truly creates affordable, simple, predictable, or embark program that focuses on high cost specialty drugs, or recent launch of our Parachute program for workers who've been displaced. So we will continue to drive innovation, and our clients are benefiting from that relative to our market leading trends. Specific to the rebate rule, your overall framing I think is right. Specifically, we do believe the rebate rule, if implemented in its current configuration would have a material effect on Cigna. It focuses on the government programs and as you know as designed today, the government run programs required and are facilitated by full pass-through, fully transparent rebate economic to start with. They were designed in the pricing scheme as indicated by government rules that we all comply with as an industry. The result of this rebate rule change is designed will result in increasing cost all seniors as an example, and thereby decreasing cost for some depending on their point-in-time drug utilization, and the rule is written today would create a conflict in terms of what would transpire around that, but from a Cigna perspective, we do not see that as having an impact on our book of business and overall performance even if the rebate rule was implemented. Stephen Tanal : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Tanal. Our next question comes from Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Bob Jones : Great, thanks for taking the questions. I guess, Eric, maybe just to go back to one on the PBM comment you made earlier in Q&A about not pulling anything major as far dynamics. I was just wondering how the Prime roll on has been going. Had that any major impact on the quarter? Is that kind of going according to plan, and then maybe just you haven't spent a lot of time on Accredo, maybe just any kind of parsing out of volumes of the traditional pharmacy business have trended relative to the specialty pharmacy. Have you seen any differential impact there as a result of the COVID environment? Eric Palmer : Yes, Bob. It's Eric. Good morning. So with respect Prime, we announced the collaboration with Prime last December. We worked quite diligently over the end of the year and through the first quarter to get ready for that when we began servicing that collaboration on April 1st. It's really performed very well and very much consistent with our expectations both in terms of services provided, timing and the volumes and the like such to getting up to a great start. We are delighted to have the relationship there. In terms of specialty, I appreciate you calling out Accredo. Accredo continues to be industry leading capability here, and it does continue to drive growth as we see more and more specialty products and as more and more clinical needs the clients those we serve or both of those things drive an additional growth within Accredo. So again, continued strong growth there as well and that's a real bright spot even in the strong health services results. Bob Jones : Right, thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Jones. Our last question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. You may ask your question. Charles Rhyee : Yes, thanks for squeezing me in here. Maybe I could ask a question about the international segment, David. You kind of said earlier sort of lower claims volumes benefiting the quarter, but maybe you can give us some sense in what your expectations are sort for maybe for the back-half. And give a sense of what the trends you are seeing globally related to COVID. And if there is anything that you can take from that as we think about how COVID may progress here in the States. Thanks. Eric Palmer : Yes, Chuck, it's Eric. I will start here. With respect to international if you noted it was a strong result year-to-date. And the segment overall continues to perform really well. We've got as I think you know two platforms within the international business. A global health benefits platform that serves employers and a more individually oriented platform that serves both kind of health and supplemental needs and such. With the employer book of business, I would say globally the dynamics were pretty similar to the dynamics that we talked about in our Integrated Medical segment. So, we saw a deferral, less utilization earlier in the quarter. Some of that's come back over the balance of the quarter. We continue to expect to see a slower recovery in terms of employment levels and the like within this business, but I think of it is having a lot of parallels with the U.S. medical business. On individual business, I think here we saw disruption back in first quarter even in terms of both sales and in terms of claims experience and such. Really seen a lot of that come back in Asia, and our Asian market is already and very much kind of back to normal in a lot of our individually oriented businesses at this point. So again, looking forward from here, we would see a continued strong performance in a business, continued growth trajectory from a growth perspective. David, what else you would like to add here? David Cordani : Just add in the learning category, as we are learning in the United States, state-by-state, we are seeing around the globe the imperative of being flexible as the pandemic ebbs and flows from that standpoint from community standpoint from health access standpoint, from the academic standpoint, from the employer standpoint, and secondly, we have seen consistently around the globe a more aggressive adoption of as I referenced before technologically-enabled health access solutions, even in environments where they previously were at a really low adoption rate, less desire to go to physical proximity to access care, if it could be delivered through technology, and we see an elevation of that those services being utilized around the globe. We think that trend will continue. Charles Rhyee : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rhyee. At this time, I turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : Thanks. Just briefly wrap up, I want to first and foremost again acknowledge and thank Cigna's more than 70,000 colleagues around the globe who worked tirelessly with great empathy throughout this pandemic to serve the needs of our customers, our patients, work within our communities, and support our clients around the world. At Cigna, our mission to improve health wellbeing and peace of mind of those we serve has never been more important, and that continues to guide our actions, and will as we go forward. In recent weeks and months, we've taken decisive actions to support our employers who we believe are the driving force to a thriving economy to withstand and emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to support the communities and customers we work and serve in each and every day, including our efforts to combat systemic racism, which we also view as a critical health issue. From a results perspective, we once again delivered strong financial performance this quarter, and we remain on track to complete our integration and reach our de-leveraging objectives by the end of this year. We continue to expand and innovative programs and services to support our clients, our customers, our patients, and our communities, and we are on track to deliver our revenue and EPS outlook for 2020, as well as our 2021 EPS target of $20 to $21 per share. With that, I thank you for joining our call today, and we look forward to future discussions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's second quarter 2020 results review.

At this time, all callers are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter the queue to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference including the question-and-answer session is being recorded. We will begin by turning the conference over to Ms. Alexis Jones. Please go ahead, Ms. Jones. Alexis Jones : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. I am Alexis Jones, Lead Principal for Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Palmer, Cigna\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics, including Cigna\u2019s third quarter 2020 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2020. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations, and adjusted revenues which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholder\u2019s net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today\u2019s earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2020 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today\u2019s earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. First, with our reporting for third quarter 2020, we have updated our segment names to align with our launch of Evernorth and to better reflect a suite of services offered across our portfolio. The segment previously reported as Health Services is now reported as Evernorth and the segment previously reported as Integrated Medical is now reported as U.S Medical. There are no changes to the underlying businesses reported in either segment. Regarding our results, in the third quarter, we recorded in after-tax special item charge of $83 million or $0.23 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. We also recorded a special item benefit of $89 million after-tax or $0.24 per share for a contractual adjustment for a former client. Finally, we recorded a special item benefit of $76 million after-tax or $0.21 per share for the receipt of payments related to our risk quarter claim. As described in today\u2019s earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance including our full year 2020 outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future share repurchases. Finally, our outlook for 2020 assumes a full year of earnings from Cigna\u2019s Group Disability and Life business. We continue to expect our divestiture of that business to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2020. With that, I will turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks, Alexis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I will begin by providing a few brief comments on Tuesday\u2019s election results, which are certainly top of mind for all of us. Then, I will speak to how Cigna\u2019s strategy accelerated by our recent launch of Evernorth, positions us to continue building on our history of delivering strong performance in dynamic and rapidly evolving environments. I will also provide comments on our strong third quarter results and I will conclude a few brief overview comments relative to 2021 before turning the call over to Eric. First, relative to the election. Certainly, we along with everybody else awaits to see a clear and orderly conclusion. Regardless of the final outcome, our mission to improve the health, well-being, and peace of mind of those we serve around the world has not changed and is more critical than ever. We are ready to continue engaging in critical discussions on healthcare with members of both sides of the aisle at federal, state and local levels. And we look forward to working constructively with the current administration or a new administration as we have been privileged to do so in the past. Looking forward, the long-term health needs of individuals and society at large transcends the results of any particular election or political climate. There is no question that simply continuing with the status quo for healthcare is not sufficient under any circumstances. Take for example that today\u2019s children are likely to be the first generation in American history to live shorter lives than their parents. Clearly, this is unacceptable. And the COVID-19 crisis has only reinforced our unsustainable healthcare challenges, including eroding individual health status, increased mental health impacts from heightened stress, anxiety and loneliness, health disparities and social determinants of health, and gaps in our healthcare delivery infrastructure. Many U.S. states are seeing their healthcare systems overwhelmed and only exacerbated by the underlying chronic conditions such as diabetes that increase the risk of severe complications from COVID-19. The bottomline is that there is no one healthcare system that is perfectly positioned. In our view, the conversation regarding healthcare must focus less on who pays the cost of an unsustainable system. In fact, systems around the world continue to struggle with unsustainability and rising costs including nationalized systems. What is important is that we work together to find solutions to meet the diverse underlying needs that are unique to a population in the most effective way possible. Regardless of the political climate, more than ever, people, governments and employers, as well as health plans are looking for healthcare systems that focus on keeping people healthy and not just treating them when they are sick, caring for the whole person, both mind and body and ensuring the most affordable, high value delivery of healthcare services. At Cigna, we are delivering on this promise and our strategy is designed to answer the call for healthcare system that is more affordable, predictable and simple. Our strategy guides us to customize our solutions to meet the diverse needs of our clients, our customers and our patients, and look at every decision and action we take to ensure it is addressing the demands for more value. We have amassed a targeted portfolio of capabilities to accelerate this direction and when combined with our partnership orientation, our focus on data driven innovation and capital flexibility, we are positioned to deliver differentiated value for those we serve and sustainable attractive growth. As you know, we recently introduced Evernorth, an evolution of our high performing health service portfolio and another important milestone in delivering on our strategy. With Evernorth, we have a distinct and dedicated platform of services and innovative healthcare solutions for health plans, employers, government organizations and healthcare providers. The launch of this new brand in September was met with overwhelming support and excitement from these viral groups. Through this dedicated platform we were demonstrating our commitment to meet their unique needs and invest in their success. Additionally, the platform further reinforces our position as the partner of choice to create more shared value for our clients and open their customers. A recent example of this is our growing partnership with Prime Therapeutics. Through our Prime relationship, we expand our retail pharmacy network and rebate administration services to more Americans through their 23 Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans. We achieve this by enhancing the retail pharmacy network and increasing affordability from pharmaceutical manufacturers. With Evernorth, our relationship with Prime will be further expanded. This includes the option for Prime\u2019s plans to access the Accredo Specialty Pharmacy and Express Scripts\u2019 home delivery in network pharmacies beginning on January 1, 2021. Evernorth reinforces our deep commitment to leverage our broad capabilities to serve health plans, employers, government entities and healthcare professionals, and pursue mutually beneficial partnerships. At the same time, we are continuing to further invest in our Cigna brand, under which are U.S. Commercial, U.S. Government and International businesses go to market. We will continue be known for a customer- and client-focus approach and for delivering industry leading trends and outstanding customer service. For example, I am pleased to announce that our Medicare Advantage business achieved an annual customer Net Promoter Score of plus 74, the fourth consecutive year we have shown an increase. In addition in 2021, 88% of our customers will be in four-star plus rated plans and we are the only major plan to achieve an increase year-over-year. This is just one example and important one of our Cigna-branded companies will continue to deliver differentiated value in the marketplace. With Cigna and the recent addition of Evernorth platform, we now have two powerful brands from which to drive sustained growth today and well into the future. Now, turning to our third quarter performance. We delivered strong results that were in line with our expectations. As a result, and as expected, we experienced the return of elevated utilization to more typical levels and ongoing impact of COVID-19. We also continue to take actions to support our customers, our clients, our coworkers, our healthcare professionals and our communities in these exceptionally challenging times. Additionally, we remain on track to complete the integration of Cigna and Express Scripts by the end of this year. Our consolidated revenue was $40.8 billion with after-tax earnings of $1.6 billion. In our Evernorth segment, we continue to deliver strong performance, demonstrating the value we bring to health plans, employers and government clients. Within the U.S. Medical segment, we saw an increase in cost as expected as utilization returned to more typical levels. And our International business continues to deliver revenue and earnings growth, as we meet the needs of our global customers as they navigate the disrupted environment due to COVID-19. With our strong third quarter results, we are confident that we will achieve our updated 2020 revenue and EPS outlook. Looking forward to 2021, we have a number of tailwinds including continued growth momentum, favorable impacts from synergies from our Express Scripts combination and further administrative synergies. We expect year-over-year headwinds from increased medical costs largely driven by the ongoing impact of COVID-19. Diving a bit more deeply into our growth momentum, we expect to drive continue to organic growth across each of our well-positioned platforms. I\u2019d specifically highlight strong growth within our pharmacy service portfolio, including specialty and underlying script growth aided by projected 98% client retention level and continued expansion of our U.S. Government business including Medicare Advantage, where we continue to drive both strong market and product expansion, as well as in-market growth, putting us on track for customer growth in our targeted range of 10% to 15% in 2021 and an individual changes where we have increased our addressable market footprint by over 50%. All-in, we are positioned for both very strong revenue and continued earnings growth in 2021, and we remain on track to achieve our strategic goal of $20 to $21 of EPS. We expect a strong operating momentum and capitalized framework to drive attractive operating cash flows of greater than $8 million. This significant cash flow generation combined with our ongoing deleveraging will give us significant strategic and financial flexibility for 2021 and beyond. Now to summarize before turning it over to Eric. Cigna has a long history of delivering strong performance in dynamic rapidly evolving environments, focused first and foremost on addressing the health and well-being needs of the individuals we serve. This approach transcends the results of any particular election cycle. We continue to build on this foundation as we delivered another strong quarter driven by the outstanding dedication of our more than 70,000 colleagues around the world who focused every day on our mission to improve the health, well-being and peace of mind of those we serve. Our mission and our strategy as champions were affordable, predictable and simple healthcare will continue to guide us, as we provide exceptional value for the benefit of our customers, patients and clients. And the launch of Evernorth will further fuel our strategy and expand our ability to serve more individuals. Finally, as we usually do, we look forward to providing more detailed and complete guidance for 2021 on our fourth quarter earnings call. With that, I will turn it over to Eric. Eric Palmer : Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will review key aspects of Cigna\u2019s third quarter results including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business and discuss our outlook for the full year. Key consolidated financial highlights for the third quarter of 2020 include, adjusted revenues of $40.8 billion, adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion after-tax and adjusted earnings per share of $4.41. Our results this quarter and year-to-date reflects focused execution across our businesses in a dynamic rapidly evolving environment. Regarding our segments, I will first comment on Evernorth. Third quarter adjusted revenues grew to $30 billion and adjusted pretax earnings grew to $1.4 billion. As previously discussed, in Evernorth, the cadence of quarterly earnings is more typical in 2020 than in 2019, where earnings were more weighted to the second half of the year due to the timing of certain supply chain initiatives. Evernorth\u2019s strong results in the quarter were driven by organic growth and customers and script volumes, the effective execution of supply chain initiatives and continued performance and expansion of specialty pharmacy services through Accredo, our industry-leading specialty pharmacy. We fulfilled 381 million adjusted pharmacy scripts, a 22% increase over the third quarter of 2019. Overall, Evernorth continued its positive momentum and delivered another strong quarter financial results. Turning to our U.S. Medical segment. Third quarter adjusted revenues were $9.6 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $757 million. These results reflect unfavorable prior period development, primarily related to the second quarter of 2020, COVID-19-related impacts and the return of the health insurance tax. COVID-19 related impacts include the return of medical utilization to more typical levels, the direct costs of COVID-19 testing and treatment, decreased especially contributions and lower net investment income. It also reflects the actions we have taken throughout the year to support our stakeholders in this disruptive environment. For all customers, we continue to waive cost sharing for COVID-19 testing and treatment. For our Medicare Advantage and individual and family plans customers, we continue to waive cost sharing for in-office and telehealth visits for primary care, specialty care, and behavioral health. For clients, we have provided premium relief programs and for our providers, we have implemented a variety of financial assistance programs. I am proud of the way that we at Cigna continue to respond to the pandemic in support of our stakeholders. Turning to membership, we ended the quarter with $17 million global medical customers, less than a 1% decline sequentially. Our U.S. commercial book of business remains resilient due to the industry mix of our clients and continued commitments that employers are making to the health and wellbeing of their employees through COVID. We also continue to see growth in Medicare Advantage, where we have grown membership 18% through the end of the third quarter and we also continue to grow in the Select segment. Overall, with the exception of the unfavorable prior period development, results in our U.S. Medical segment are in line with our expectations. Turning to our International markets business, third quarter adjusted revenues were $1.4 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $208 million, reflecting continued operational efficiency, lower claims due to COVID-19 and ongoing business growth. For our Group Disability and Other Operations segment, third quarter adjusted revenues were $1.3 billion. Third quarter adjusted pretax earnings for the segment were $70 million, reflecting elevated life claims due to the pandemic. For our Corporate segment, the third quarter of 2020 loss of $356 million reflects lower interest expenses due to the lower levels of outstanding debt. Overall, as a result of focused execution in a dynamic environment, we continue to deliver value for all of our stakeholders and strong financial results. Now, looking forward to our outlook for full year 2020. As we look to the balance of the year, we expect continued strong execution across our portfolio of businesses. We expect medical utilization to remain at more typical levels with continued direct costs of COVID-19 testing and treatment and we expect some increase in commercial disenrollment due to continued dislocation in the broader labor market. In the fourth quarter, we will also continue to make investments to support our clients, customers and employees in this disrupted environment. And taken as a whole, we now expect full year 2020 consolidated adjusted revenues of approximately $158 billion and we now expect full year consolidated adjusted earnings per share in the range of $18.30 to $18.60. I would remind you that our financial outlook excludes the impact of future share repurchases and assumes a full year of contributions from our Group Disability and Life business, although we continue to expect our divestiture of that business to close in the fourth quarter. Overall, these expected results are driven by strong underlying fundamentals, disciplined expense management and the effective deployment of capital. Now moving to our 2020 capital and liquidity position and outlook, third quarter cash flows from operations of $895 million, reflect the additional third quarter tax payments of approximately $826 million that was delayed from the second quarter as permitted under the CARES Act, as well as the payment of $445 million for the health insurance tax for the full year. Through the end of the third quarter, cash flows from operations were $6 billion, and for 2020, we now expect cash flows from operations of greater than $8 billion. Our businesses generated substantial amount of cash flow and in combination with $5.3 billion in net proceeds expected from the sale of our Group Disability and Life business, we have significant capital and financial flexibility. Through the end of the third quarter, we deployed $1.7 billion to debt repayment and our debt to capitalization ratio of 42.8% as of September 30th is improved from 45.2% in December 31, 2019. We are at $1.2 billion of cash available at the parents at the end of the third quarter, and on a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased $16 million shares of stock for $2.9 billion. Following the close of the group transaction, free cash available to the parents is expected to be at least $7 billion and we expect to deploy $4 billion to $5 billion to return our debt to capitalization ratio below 40%. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient, service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and returns on capital. Now to recap, our third quarter consolidated results reflect focused execution across our businesses and the dynamic rapidly evolving environment with particular strength the momentum in our Evernorth segment. We are well positioned to meet the financial targets we have established for 2020, all while continuing to support our clients, customers and employees, and as such, we now expect 2020 full year adjusted EPS of $18.30 per share to $18.60 per share and remain on track to deliver on our target of $20 to $21 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021. With that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Sir, your line is open. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. I want to ask, first, can you give us a little more color on the negative development that you said that you attributed to the second quarter in terms of the drivers and maybe what business would have been? And then, secondly, can you give us any update on the deal close, what states or what needs to happen to get this close and what you might give us some more fulsome kind of thought process around capital deployment given post that deal close over the next 12 months, 14 months, you will have somewhere by my math $8 billion to $10 billion to deploy, but thoughts on dividend things like that? Thanks. Eric Palmer : Thanks, Justin. Good morning. So I will start with the reserve development piece first. So stepping back here about, just to remind you, as we look back to the second quarter, we had significantly lower utilization in April and May, and as we close out the second quarter we had to make estimates around the claims associated with the month of June. Now with the benefit of hindsight, utilization in the month of June came back a little bit faster than we previously estimated. So the way I\u2019d have you think about this Justin is we recorded about 1 point in the loss ratio in the third quarter that really should have been back in the second quarter. So, again, think about 100 basis points on the loss ratio in this third quarter results relating to in-year reserve development that\u2019s associated with the second quarter. That\u2019s the headline in terms of the reserve development. As you think about the thesis, I would point that primarily to the Commercial business in terms of the line of business, et cetera. In terms of the deal close, to go to that part of your question, we are on track for closing in the fourth quarter. We have put out a release a couple of -- in September, so a handful of weeks to go now, nothing that we had 55 out of the 65 required regulatory approvals. We now have 63 of the 65 required regulatory approval, so we are right at the cusp of getting that transaction closed and going from there. I will let David take the kind of forward-looking comments in terms of capital deployment and the like. David Cordani : Justin, good morning. Appreciate your question. And embedded in your question is acknowledgement of the strategic positioning of our portfolio. As you noted, we will be producing a significant -- need to produce a significant amount of cash flow that is deployable from that standpoint. From our point of view, stepping back, as noted in Eric\u2019s prepared remarks, you saw that we were pretty active in the share repurchase domain over the third quarter and saw some tremendous opportunity there. Specific to your question, as I noted, we are going to look forward to providing 2021 guidance on our fourth quarter call and you might expect that as we complete our group closure, as Eric articulated in the fourth quarter and stepping into the first quarter, we have an opportunity not just to refresh our 2021 outlook, but also to refresh our capital deployment priorities and alike off of that very strong base. So we look forward to that conversation. Justin Lake : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with JP Morgan. Your line is open, sir. Gary Taylor : Hi. Good morning. First, a clarification and then a question, in the slide deck you do explicitly still point to the $20 to $21 in 2021. So I just wanted to confirm you are explicitly affirming that today. It just wasn\u2019t featured real prominently in the release. So I do want to make sure on that. And then, my question is on your experience-rated Commercial business, are there going to be premium or MLR headwinds because of lower utilization as you move into 2021 or has there been enough customer relief, so to speak, that it skews out that dynamic? Eric Palmer : Hi, Gary. It\u2019s Eric. So on the first one, just to be clear, yes, we are reaffirming the $20 to $21 target and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any ambiguity on that. That\u2019s been a target we have had for some time and we continue to be on track for that. So, again, I think the short answer to that question is, yes. On the experience-rated business, so as customers, as our clients have different levels of utilization and if there are favorable utilization, we accrue for that in the period. So, I would not think about there being any future headwinds here. Many kind of the dynamics associated with lower utilization are already reflected in the results and in the current period. So I would not think about that as a headwind in the future. Gary Taylor : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Taylor. Our next question comes from Steve Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open. Andrew Mok : Hi. Good morning. This is Andrew Mok on for Steve. I wanted to revisit the Medicare Advantage growth targets. When you unveiled the new MA strategy last year, you laid out 10% to 15% membership growth targets with 2020 serving as a stepping stone year. You are now on track to outperform the high end of that target in year one and it looks like you will have a very attractive product offering for 2021? So is it fair to say that your formal growth targets even at the high end might be a bit conservative when we think about 2021 membership growth? Thanks. David Cordani : Andrew, good morning. It\u2019s David. Thanks for referring me to the question. So stepping back, we are delighted with our performance in 2020 for starters, and as we laid out that multiyear 10% to 15% growth objective. We also underscored the fact that we were going to systematically expand our positioning in the market from less than 20% of the addressable market in 2019 to 50% of the addressable market 2024. So we are systematically expanding our geographies and we have added a new platform in terms of individual PPO in 2020. So that continues to carry forward. As it relates to 2021, our view of -- our positioning of our offerings in the marketplace, we feel quite good about that. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we have a strong base to jump off of relative to 80% star rating and a Net Promoter Score of 74. We remain committed to that 10% to 15% range. We look forward to providing you updates as we go forward. We always strive to perform at our best. And I appreciate your optimism and make sure that the senior team knows your optimism as well relative to this, but we are excited to end 2020 with a strong year and step into 2021 with some great growth momentum and look forward to continuing that beyond 2021. Andrew Mok : Got it. If I could just have a quick follow up. How are you thinking about potential inorganic opportunities related to the senior platform? Thanks. David Cordani : So specific to inorganic opportunities, we have continued to have a portfolio of inorganic priorities. We have historically had five priorities or so that we have walked through and we previously refreshed them about a year ago at our Investor Day from that standpoint and U.S. seniors remains on that list. The underpinning growth chassis for this business is an organic growth chassis, to be clear. So we will be opportunistic and always open minded relative to inorganic opportunities. But the growth chassis here is an organic growth chassis aided by our end market growth, our platform expansion into individual PPO, our new market entry, which I referenced before, as well as over time additional employer, right, with growth from that standpoint. So it\u2019s organic first and opportunistic on an organic as appropriate in the future. Andrew Mok : Got it. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Valiquette. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open, sir. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe just ask about, I think, this is the first quarterly call you have done since you established the Evernorth business as a separate distinct entity. Maybe just give us a little bit of your thinking behind that decision to move that into the separate entity and begin to have its own brand identification. What does it say about where the company is going in terms of incremental business lines that that might pursue, tuck-in acquisitions, service capabilities and just give us a little bit more of your thinking about where you are going with the Evernorth business? David Cordani : A.J., good morning. It\u2019s David. So specifically relative to Evernorth, as I noted, we are quite excited to have launched that in September. We view it as a further reinforcement of an acceleration of our health service strategy. We have talked for quite some time as a business -- an evolving business portfolio of services and a health service portfolio. Specific to Evernorth, the way I\u2019d ask you to think about it is, one, it\u2019s a further reinforcement of the dedication we have of resources for supporting large complex employer needs, health plan needs, governmental entity needs, both federal as well as state agency needs, as well as healthcare-integrated systems and healthcare providers who were taking performance based risks or value based programs around that. Within our portfolio today, we have a large well performing pharmacy services portfolio solutions, we have a benefit management solutions to bring forward to the marketplace, we have care management solutions and a growing portfolio of data and analytics solutions from that standpoint. And lastly, to your comment, we see this not only as an attractive organic growth platform and our performance reinforces that we are building from strength, but also an opportunity for tuck-in or expansion capabilities as we go forward. And illustratively from that standpoint, we continue to see the opportunity to expand services that we offer to individuals around care delivery and care coordination from that standpoint, embracing technology, embracing virtual services, expanding our home healthcare capabilities, et cetera. We are readily building some of those capabilities organically today and we will be opportunistic from an inorganic standpoint. So just an acceleration of our service portfolio, dedication of resources, reinforcing our partner of choice orientation and a very broad portfolio of services today that will continue to expand for the benefit of those we can serve. A.J. Rice: Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open, sir. Josh Raskin : Thanks. Good morning. Can you just give us some feedback on the integrated PBM and medical offering, as you guys are a year further past the integration with Express Scripts and kind of how that\u2019s going into 2021. Are employers looking at that integration or the table stakes, and sort of if that\u2019s the case, what are the key differentiators you are going to market with? David Cordani : Josh, good morning. It\u2019s David. So, first, as a backdrop, as you know, we have had a long history within the Cigna portfolio of integrated offerings from employers, with a deep conviction relative to integrating those offerings with medical off of the then Cigna PBM, behavioral health, and care management services and that continues. The combination helps us further strengthen that value proposition in terms of furthering the affordability dimension of it, but also bringing some more systemic flexibility for solution design that we can bring toward middle market and larger client from that standpoint. And I would say that that continues, continued traction relative to the integrated proposition. In addition to that, our results show the underlying strength of the pharmacy services from a point solution as we think about it or a specific either PBM, PBM and specialty, or broader suite of services around that. And then through Evernorth, we see the opportunity to further expand that by coordinating, say, behavior health with pharmacy services going forward. So to the core of your question, our strength and momentum continues, the strong clinical outcomes we are delivering continues, many employer/buyers value that integrated proposition and were oriented around that within the Cigna brand, but some larger corporate buyers orient still around either an a la carte or point solution and increasingly looking for some additional leverage around that, we talked about coordinated benefits by bringing, say, pharmacy and behavioral together to coordinate those services and as a combined corporation with the Cigna brand and the Evernorth brand, we are really well-positioned to deliver for either buyer orientation. Josh Raskin : Thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Raskin. Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open, sir. Kevin Fischbeck : Hi. Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask about the commercial membership trends. In the quarter, you mentioned that things are getting better in part because of furloughs or also in part because of your customer segments that you are targeting. It sounds like you are assuming that attrition will accelerate in the future. But I guess, have your thoughts changed at all about the size of the decline that you might see during this recession and how resilient your customer membership might be over the next few quarters even with unemployment at these levels? David Cordani : So, Kevin, good morning. It\u2019s David. First, as we get into the commercial conversation, I do want to pause for a second and recognize from what we see is just a tremendous contribution that employers are making right now in these disruptive times facing COVID. We are seeing employers of all sizes work, stretch, innovate to do everything possible to support their employees and their family members, whether those are expanded services, additional coverages relative to testing and treatment costs. And they are working tirelessly to either minimize the layoffs or when they need to transpire, doing them through furloughs and having coordination. So I do think it\u2019s important to pause there and recognize the power of that system right now and corporations of all shapes and sizes working really hard to support individuals. As it relates to membership, as Eric noted, in the big picture of a disruptive environment, we are pleased with our performance. Our portfolio tends to be well-positioned by industry sub-segment and our transparency of our programs has us highly aligned with employers. For example, through the third quarter, our employer clients because of our transparent funding mechanisms have about $3 billion less spending than they otherwise would have projected to have given the environment and the continuity of cash flow that takes place around that is quite helpful, above and beyond that we have taken some additional steps. As we look forward, we know it\u2019s a disruptive environment. We expect right now as we look at the environment that we will continue to see employer customer disruption throughout the residual part of this year and into 2021. That\u2019s factored into our outlook when we talk about 2021 in detail. Next quarter, we will try to give you more insight relative to that. We are expecting, net-net, with our new growth, as well as retention as well this enrollment, we would go from the end of this calendar year\u2019s number to the beginning 2021 with approximately stable commercial membership, as we continue selling to Select segment, continue to have some retention losses, but all within our strategic range. And then throughout the course of the year, while we expect to see some continued disenrollment pressure, our outlook relative to growth is quite positive with some known traction into 2021. We expect to see some slight growth going forward. So, all in all, in a highly disruptive environment, we are very pleased with the results were able to deliver and we are fortunate to be partnered with so many commercial clients that are putting their employees first front and center. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open, sir. Ralph Giacobbe : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you talk a little bit more about how the onboarding Prime has gone and the opportunity not just on the retail but on the specialty side? And how the option or I guess options perhaps works for each of the blues? And then what impact that could have either in 2021 or if we have to consider a certain cost and whether it\u2019s more of 2020 impact? Thanks. David Cordani : Good morning, Ralph. So, first and foremost, relative to Prime, as I noted in the prepared remarks, we work every day to try to earn that right to be as we call it an undisputed partner of choice. It\u2019s a strategic imperative. It guides our actions and underlying that, we need to have the products, programs and services to deliver value. But we also have to have the orientation to partner and to seek mutual alignment. We are pleased with the early configuration with Prime. We established that and stood up in April of this calendar year and it\u2019s performing well. The further dedication we had around Evernorth and our performance relative to that first expansion services earned us the right, as we noted, too and the opportunity to be able to serve Prime in a more expansive basis. We will see that growth continue systematically throughout 2021. As I noted in my prepared remarks, the plans have choices. We are a choice-based framework. But the, for example, the Accredo value proposition is a tremendous value proposition and we are excited to expand that starting in January 1st for many of the Prime plans. There\u2019s investments -- there\u2019s ongoing investments we are making. That\u2019s factored in to our outlook for this year. There will be further investments we are making in the fourth quarter of this year for the tremendous underpinning of growth around that. But we are well-positioned to be able to make that happen and achieve our goals and objectives for 2020 that Eric noted in terms of our refreshed objective and as we get into the detailed 2021 guidance next quarter, we will try to give you a little bit more color. But we just see this as an ongoing expansion of a mutually beneficial relationship, where we are able to create together some tremendous value that individuals will benefit from as we expand those we are able to serve. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Giacobbe. Our next question is from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Market. Your line is open, sir. Matthew Borsch : Yes. I was hoping to just ask about the level of medical trend particularly in your commercial book but Medicare too that you are seeing now and I am trying to understand if we put aside the actions that you have taken to grant relief to patients and providers and just look at it from the standpoint of the recovery and utilization plus the direct cost of COVID. Are you below trend, above trend or at trend and where do you expect that to go as we get into next year? Eric Palmer : Matt, it\u2019s Eric. Good morning. So, with respect to the component pieces, I touched on it a little bit on my prepared remarks, but to unpack the components. I would have you think about putting COVID aside, utilization being slightly below kind of what we would have said would be normal. So call it 95%-ish for the third quarter in terms of kind of normal levels of utilization. When you add on top of that the impact of testing and treatment for COVID and on top of that the additional actions that we have taken to reduce barriers or reduce cost sharing and to ensure our customers have access to the care, that puts you all together a little bit above the normal. And you might remember, in the second quarter, we had set an expectation that the loss ratio for the second half of this year would be elevated relative to what you otherwise might call it a normal loss ratio. So when you put those pieces together, those are that big building blocks. The only other thing I note is, it really does vary by geography. So as we have had the COVID play in and out of different geographies that kind of move things up and down and such. But, again, when you roll it all up together in aggregate, it would be consistent with what I just described. Matthew Borsch : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Borsch. Our next question is from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Your line is open, sir. Mr. Windley, are you on mute? Mr. Windley, we are unable to hear you with your question. We will move on to the next question, who is Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open, sir. Scott Fidel : Okay. Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just interested if you can just throw in a bit more on, I know David had mentioned as one of the tailwinds for 2021 being some opportunities for administrative savings. And just interested if you have established or can identify a specific cost savings target yet or -- and if not, maybe just talk about some of the key buckets of admin savings opportunity that you see for 2021? Thanks. Eric Palmer : Yeah. Scott, it\u2019s Eric. Good morning. So I would not call out any particular initiative or program. I think about the opportunity here as really being much more in our continued ongoing drive for improving affordability of our services overall. I mean, just think about things like leveraging technology, improving the efficiency, automation, et cetera, of all the different processes throughout the organization. But, I think, again, it\u2019s just part of the culture of us continuing to create efficiencies versus any particular program. Scott Fidel : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Fidel. Our next question is from John Ransom with Raymond James. Your line is open, sir. John Ransom : Hey. Good morning. A two-part question, if you would. Number one, how do you think about the materiality if at all if the unlikely event happens that there\u2019s a wholesale pharma manufacturer revolt against 340B discounts at contract pharmacies? And then, secondly, we are seeing an acceleration of the rise of these new models that promise 20%, 30%, 40% savings on medical trend by integrating primary care doctors and data. Are you still committed to your CPI goal and do you think that the market can just continue to sustain mid single digit-trends for Evernorth or do you think the industry is vulnerable as the trend continues to kind of double and triple CPI? Thanks. David Cordani : It\u2019s David. Let me take it in reverse order. So when we step forward and put forth the CPI goal and objective, I think, it caused the market to question whether or not that was theoretical possible or otherwise. But it was a conversation that needs to be had, because we established it around an orientation that it was a symbol of sustainability, not that it was perfect, but it\u2019s a symbol of sustainability. Said otherwise, if total basket of goods costs from a societal standpoint are increasing by X, whatever X is, 2%, businesses need to find a way to approximate that to create a level of sustainability or better from that standpoint. And we are proud of the fact that we have delivered the lowest medical cost trend, and by the way the lowest pharmacy trend in our space as best anybody could tell apples-to-apples year in, year out. So that continuation is mission critical. This is a unique year, as everybody knows, relative to COVID in terms of disrupting the trend. But we continue to drive toward that. Second within the context of your question, we see many, to your term, disruptive or innovative models to drive step function improvements and we have many clients today pre-COVID that are benefiting from CPI or well better than CPI trend who are on the highly innovative dimension of consumer engagement, incentive alignment, heavy leverage and utilization of value-based care provider groups and center of excellence leverage from that standpoint, et cetera, et cetera. So, you used the word disruption, I will use the word innovation. We see the need for relentless drive relative to that, because as I noted in my prepared remarks, we can\u2019t continue to afford and no society can continue to afford paying at the levels that are being driven. The last point I\u2019d make here is, our open-framed partner orientation has us embrace, if you will, innovators or disruptors be they care delivery systems or alike from that standpoint. So, more to follow here. I appreciate you highlighting it and we remain extremely committed to driving optimal value here. As it relates to your first point, there\u2019s a bunch of, I\u2019d say, hypotheticals and theoreticals within that. The way I hear your first point though more broadly is, it\u2019s another example of pressing for a sustained affordability 340B was designed with a specific purpose and intent in mind. There are many hospitals and delivery system infrastructures that need 340B to make them work. It\u2019s an interesting time to have that conversation, whereby delivery system infrastructures are strained in ways we haven\u2019t seen in the past due to COVID causing massive revenue ramifications, of which governmental intervention and some player like our self and others in our space are providing support from that standpoint. So, it\u2019s an interesting time to have that theoretical conversation, but unlike most programs it will most likely evolve and our broader service portfolio is positioned to evolve with it. John Ransom : Thanks so much. David Cordani : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Ransom. And our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks for the question. I guess just a couple clarifications on Evernorth. I mean, first, just to follow-up on Josh\u2019s question on the Integrated Medical pharmacy offering. I am just curious if you are actually seeing less desire or less PBM carve-outs in the market today or is it still something more of a discussion point with your customers? And then just on the quarter, Evernorth did see a fairly meaningful step up in OpEx and you touched on some of these items. Just curious, is that kind of more one-time in nature this year versus next year or is this probably or potentially a more permanent level of spend as we think about the Evernorth business? David Cordani : Good morning, Rob. It\u2019s David. I will take the first question and I will ask Eric to address your second question. The simple answer is, no. We don\u2019t see a C change in terms of buyer behavior relative to wanting more of or less of. It\u2019s one client at a time. We have a very much of a consultative orientation trying to find the right configuration of benefits and funding mechanisms that work for clients. Now, within that, our Select segment is an integrated offering, full stop, period, the end. It\u2019s designed to be an integrated offering, whether it\u2019s on an ASO platform or a guarantee cost platform. As you move upmarket into commercial employer space within middle market and national accounts, you see different buying behaviors and it ebbs and flows. And I think the important message here is that, as an entity, we are extremely well-positioned to deliver what a client wants, whether they want a fully integrated offering, whether they want a point solution, a best-in-class PBM or best-in-class specialty pharmacy or both from that standpoint, or increasingly you are looking to get some additional value off coordination of services, be it care management services, behavior health, et cetera, relative to that. But I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s a C change. I would say think about Evernorth and Cigna together as being extremely well-positioned to deliver on the value that buyers want, be it integrated, point solutions if you want standalone pharmacy services in this case or evolving some coordination of services to get another step function of value that come along with that. Eric? Eric Palmer : Yeah. On the G&A ratio, in particular, there\u2019s just a couple of things I call out here. At the most macro level, we do continue to spend and continue to invest in building additional capabilities in this business and you see that in the G&A. There are a couple of other impacts that caused it as well. One, as you might remember, we talked a bit in the past, after the close of the acquisition, just kind of rebuilding of the amortization. So the amortization on the assets you acquired gets reset and then we have to rebuild that expense into that -- have built over the -- up over time. Offsetting that is us continuing to work to find synergies and find additional efficiencies. So, again, those would be the biggest buckets that play into that ratio in any given quarter. But it\u2019s not we will be looking to continue to spend and build additional capabilities there as we go forward. Robert Jones : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Jones. Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Your line is open, sir. Mr. Rhyee, your line is open. Are you on mute? Moving on to our next question, it\u2019s from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Your line is open, sir. Lance Wilkes : Yeah. Good morning. Just had a question on the Prime Therapeutics opportunity and maybe if you could help us to frame that as far as like what\u2019s the further penetration into the existing relationship? How could penetration improve as you kind of do direct relationships or subsequent relationships with other blues? And then their sell-through so they get carved out less, how does that improve really the Prime penetration opportunity? And then maybe just as a clarification, you mentioned decreased specialty contribution in the prepared remarks, if you could just maybe clarify what that meant as well? Thanks. David Cordani : Lance, good morning. It\u2019s David. I will take the first part of your question. I will ask Eric to take the second part of your question. I think to frame the first part of your question broadly is, first and foremost, we need to earn the right to serve clients each and every day. We were fortunate to be selected to be a partner with Prime as we set up the opportunity earlier this year, began servicing them in April and those service offerings are working quite well. That positioned us and was -- reinforced with our commitment with Evernorth to expand those services and we will have the ability to grow at a choice based on the Prime participants as they so choose relative to our specialty pharmacy and alike. It allows us to have an opportunity to mutually grow together. Your point relative to the sell-through and otherwise, our team is focused on strengthening the value proposition of Prime and of the Prime members -- member plans to have more value offered to their customers and grow their portfolio businesses, full stop. That is the commitment of the team supporting the Prime relationship, and therefore, it should allow for us to continue to grow off of the existing platform. It should allow for us to continue to grow as the Prime representation grows and it should allow us to continue to grow, as to your point, their sell-through has more traction on a go-forward basis and our business model is designed to do so. So stay tuned for more. But the positioning that we have today we really love, because now we will be able to leverage our high performing specialty portfolio, as well as our very strong and well-performing a mail order pharmacy services operation for their benefit. Eric? Eric Palmer : Yeah. On the specialty contribution, Lance, to the comments that I made around specialty contributions here refers to the portfolio of specialty capabilities we have benefits overall. So things like health, behavioral, disease management, care management, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. This has been a core part of our go-to-market approach for some time and a high performing business. And as you know, we did call out, a bit lower contribution from these products in the quarter. And as you think about a couple of items here, one, as an example, we have seen significant increases in behavioral costs in 2020 in the third quarter in particular. Utilization there above our prior expectation as we have seen stresses and anxiety take a toll just on the mental health of the nation at large, one. And then, two, the impact our volumes, right? So as we had a little bit of lower volume that comes through this business as well. But those would be the items that I\u2019d refer to you in terms of specialty contributions. Lance Wilkes : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Wilkes. Our next question is from Sarah James with Piper Sandler. Your line is open, ma\u2019am. Sarah James : Thank you. I was looking back at the transcript of the second quarter and I know at that time we talked about you not seeing a slowdown in claims receipt as of July 30, but then today you are talking about 100 basis points of 3Q MLR being related to June. So it sounds like there\u2019s a slowdown in claims receipt in June that maybe wasn\u2019t there in April or May. I am wondering, as a result of that, did you change your assumptions in completion factor for how you reported 3Q and for what percent of claims comes 60 days out or greater? And was there any impact on how you think about reserves or DCP as a result of that? Thanks. Eric Palmer : Hi, Sarah. It\u2019s Eric. So on the -- good memory, I remember your question from the last call as well on that front, and I would still say, we haven\u2019t seen a change in speed of submission or anything along those lines from a claims perspective. Now the month of June, as I noted in response to one of the other questions and in my prepared remarks that, the most recent month we estimate really based more off of our estimation of activity, not so much extrapolating from kind of the claims that have been received yet or anything along those lines. So, and as I noted, all else equal, we would have exited the month of June now a bit higher than what we did a quarter ago. But think of that as pretty isolated in terms of the impact. As we now have looked at the development of June and looked at our experience in July, August, September even if the emerging experience from October seem quite consistent in terms of the return to normal, the levels of utilization, levels of speed of processing, et cetera. And if you look at our day claims payable metric, well, that metric is not perfect, I mean, you see actually a pretty good degree of consistency in terms of the basically entail the metric for where we sit here at the end of third quarter 2020 compared with prior third quarters or things along those lines. So, at a macro level, quite comfortable that we have got the right estimates and such year, and the estimation of claims and the overall speed of utilization, et cetera. Sarah James : I guess just to be more specific, when you 3Q MLR, did you assume whatever factor in June that that you are seeing now continued through 3Q MLR. So whether that\u2019s a slowdown or ends up being conservatism and swings the other way with positive development, but did you hold that consistent and so you placed though by month? Eric Palmer : Yeah. So we placed through -- yeah. So we placed through the assumptions consistently by month. So, again, just to unpack that a bit further, we had estimated the month of June, I made some comments a quarter ago about June being closer back to normal levels of utilization with the benefit of hindsight, it was much closer to normal. So, previously, think about that as having been the single-digit closer to kind of a zero level of variation from utilization and we placed those types of assumptions all the way through in terms of each of our estimates for the month since then. So, again, we would think that the June impact was isolated to the month of June. Operator : Thank you for your question, Ms. James. Our next question is from Stephen Tanal with SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Stephen Tanal : Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess, David, I hope to follow-up in your comments in the commercial market and clarify the point about enrollment into 2021, maybe tie that back to the selling season for group accounts. I think I heard national accounts enrollment might be down 20%, 21%, but offset by Select and middle market growth. I just wanted to clarify that? And also wondering if you could elaborate on your comment in the actions employers are taking in response to the pandemic as it relates to this business. Are you seeing benefit buy down there, what kind of innovation that you mentioned is resonating with employers into 2021, maybe if you could give us a sense for how pricing is going in the group insured side as well that would be helpful? David Cordani : Good morning. Let me take it in reverse order. So specific to employer actions, obviously, unique to each employer, but if we step back and talk about a few of the general trends. First and foremost, the press for improved affordability and value transcends buyers of all shapes and sizes. And through our both prepared remarks and our dialogue today, we continue to reinforce the actions we are taking relative to further improvement of affordability and value trend deflection in the light from that standpoint and our results remain quite strong relative to that. Beyond that, employers are both reaching. So expanding services of a self-funded employer determines, are they going to waive the cost responsibility for individuals around testing, around treatment from that standpoint, example one. Two, are they going to expand services for telehealth or virtual service fulfillment at little to no cost from that standpoint? Many employers have expanded those services. Third, pressing, as Eric articulated before to recognize that the behavioral challenges that had been ramping from a societal standpoint, as we have been oriented around mind and body, have stepped up to another threshold level. So, reaching for identifying additional, we will call it, behavior health and wellbeing services to help to deal with beyond the core of what mental health services are dealing with around stress or on anxiety, around resiliency, around loneliness from that standpoint. So we are seeing employers step into a whole variety of actions and press from an innovation standpoint, press themselves from a care delivery standpoint, et cetera, before we get to the decisions they make when they decide to furlough somebody versus lay them off to try to have continuity of benefits for the benefit of those individuals. Back to the comments relative to the selling season, I must try to provide a little bit of direction there so I punch it up a little bit, but we will go through the appropriate detail on the fourth quarter call. What I indicated is as we look at the overall commercial medical customer environment. First and foremost, our results through three-quarters of this year are strong, given the dislocations happening in the environment and our overall portfolio continues to perform well from that standpoint. Second, I indicated that as we sit here today, we would expect that the medical membership that will end the year with and we expect to see continued disenrollment pressure throughout the course of this year. The medical membership that will end this year with will be about the same medical membership we will have on January 1 plus or minus. There\u2019s puts and takes there. There\u2019s always some lost accounts. Although, our retention outlook is quite strong. There\u2019s always some one accounts that come through from that standpoint and this enrollment will continue. The net of all that in the month of January, our estimation is that we will be about stable and that we will see some membership growth throughout the course of the year. In part, what you heard with that is the Select segment sells every month. Every month is the most important month for that segment. So we will see continued growth contributions come along relative to that. We have visibility relative to some additional growth in the mid part of the year, and then ultimately, we are expecting that the disenrollment pressure in 2021 will continue at a minimum throughout the first half plus of 2021. So I hope that color helps you kind of shape both what we are seeing in terms of the buying environment as well as what we are seeing relative to our outlook. Stephen Tanal : Helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Tanal. Our next question is from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, Mr. Hill. George Hill : Yeah. Good morning, guys. And this is actually a bit of a follow up on Steve\u2019s question, which is kind of given the rapid growth of telemedicine and all these digitally enabled solutions that we have seen come to market over the last year. So, could you talk about the demand this selling season for the digital formulary solution and the Embarc specialty insurance product? And I guess how far away do we think they are from being meaningful contributors to the Evernorth segment? David Cordani : Good morning. It\u2019s David. So as we step back to think about there\u2019s two different examples to use the digital formulary and Embarc, but embedded in the first part of your comment. As we look at what the COVID environment has done, it\u2019s probably jumped multiple years of adoption relative to additional services from that standpoint. Not unique to our industry but specific to our industry, as we take telehealth and as we take the kind of re-envisioning what can be fulfilled in the home, both safely and a highly personalized way in a more affordable way, leveraging technology in a different way. So we see, what we call, virtual care, so taking telehealth a little bit more broadly in a more comprehensive way as a market trend that will not reverse itself, where we will see some both tremendous adoption growth, and importantly, value for individuals not just from an affordability standpoint, but from a personalization standpoint through that lens and there are a variety of issues, we have both through partner relationships, we have organic initiatives we have and alike. Specific to digital formulary, Embarc, I would not ask you to think about any one launch within our portfolio as the launch or the silver bullet. Rather, we are really proud of the fact that even over the first two years as a combined corporation, we have had a consistent drumbeat of new innovations and new offerings that we have been able to bring to market for the benefit of our existing and prospective clients that we are able to serve through that through the Evernorth framework and there\u2019s a dedicated innovation infrastructure and body resources there. So, the digital formulary has had very good receptivity. Embarc, Embarc is a little bit of a different value proposition, where it\u2019s client-by-client opportunities, but it also is indicative of us changing the narrative, trying to take a problem statement that societies said is unsolvable relative to the high cost game changing super specialty drugs from that standpoint and trying to turn it into a more affordable, predictable simplified offering and you should expect us to bring more offerings akin to that to the marketplace. So we see those as positive contributors, indications of also our conviction relative to innovation and conviction relative to value delivery, and it\u2019s contributing to our revenue growth chassis. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ma\u2019am, your line is open. Ricky Goldwasser : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Biosimilars was highlighted as a growth driver this quarter and some of the supply chain costs. When you think about the impact of biosimilars on Express in the quarter, have you seen any outsized benefit? And also just how do you think about biosimilars positioning within formularies versus innovator products? Eric Palmer : Yeah. Ricky, it\u2019s Eric. I will start. So, in terms of calling anything out in the quarter, I really wouldn\u2019t note any particular impact. I think the potential here is meaningful in the future. So quite excited about the future opportunity as there are more therapies and treatments in the market and things along those lines, but I wouldn\u2019t call out anything related to the third quarter in terms of notable impact. David Cordani : Ricky, picking up on an Eric\u2019s point, I agree with his statements instead picking up on the opportunity. As we think about biosimilars fallout from a U.S. societal dimension, it represents a tremendous opportunity. And while it is grounded in supply chain it\u2019s by no means limited to supply chain, because the biosimilar dimension, you need to have deep and broad political acumen, both in the pharmaceutical arena, but then the additional reach within the practicing physicians to ensure that the decisions made one patient at a time are grounded in the appropriate clinical orientation. And as a combined corporation now we not only have the supply chain infrastructure and the deep and well performing pharmacy clinical infrastructure, but we have deep medical relationships through value based care underlying relationships that positions us quite well. And we are excited to get on with biosimilar adoption rate, where the U.S., if we are honest with ourselves lags, some other countries relative to the approval rate and from an affordability and value standpoint, we need to get on with it and we are well-positioned as a combined corporation to deliver great value there. Operator : Thank you for your question, Ms. Goldwasser. Our last question is from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Your line is open, sir. Charles Rhyee : Hi. Can you guys hear me? David Cordani : Yes. We can. Charles Rhyee : Okay. Great. Okay. Thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in here. And just maybe a two-part question here. First, on vaccines, with the potential COVID vaccine coming, can you talk about sort of the how that kind of impacts the company both positive from -- I guess, a revenue standpoint and a cost standpoint? And talk about sort of what -- how pricing and reimbursement, as you understand it, maybe at this point I know it\u2019s very early -- could happen because I understand the government has bought a first big tranche of vaccine. How do you understand the distribution of that to work particularly as we think maybe more from the Evernorth side? And then, secondly, related to that, I think, yesterday Biogen had a very positive ad com meeting for their new Alzheimer\u2019s drug. Again, maybe if you could, Dave, walk through how we -- or Eric, how we should think about that impacting maybe the Evernorth business. Is that something you would expect to distribute to the Accredo brand and is this something I would fall into the Embarc program as well? Thanks. David Cordani : Good morning. It\u2019s David. So, in your first point, there is there\u2019s multiple dimensions within that. But stepping back on the vaccine, in the current configuration, we don\u2019t step into this viewing that the vaccine presents a unique revenue generation opportunity. It\u2019s a service opportunity. It will be facilitated through Evernorth for sure. The pricing, the reimbursement structure, et cetera, that will evolve will be very based on the specific vaccines that manifest themselves, as you know. Our political leadership team is highly embedded in the national dialogue relative to this including the distribution, complexity that comes along with these vaccines that our society is starting to get their arms around relative to more than one dose, the continuity that needs to transpire, how society will be kind of prioritized from medical professionals through first responders, to high-risk individuals, et cetera. And we are well configured as a large service provider to be in support of and in service to that initiative and we look forward relative to that. Our team is taking prudent estimates relative to what we think the cost of the vaccines would be relative to 2021 outlook as well through that lens. As relates to the Alzheimer\u2019s drug, I think, it\u2019s another good example of ongoing innovation where as we hit the pause button for a moment and recognize that the vast majority of innovation in the present environment and as we extrapolate forward around healthcare innovation is and will continue to transpire pharmaceutically, right? The chapter is evolving on an accelerated basis that clinical innovation globally will be heavily pharmaceutically oriented from that standpoint. And the Alzheimer drug, which is quite exciting from a societal standpoint, is also extremely complex and costly. Hence having market leading specialty pharmacy capability per Accredo position does quite well and to your last point, presents additional opportunities to potentially expand the Embarc program, which we would suggest would transpire over time. So I think it\u2019s a good concrete example of what the future has in store relative to very exciting and life-changing drugs, but also highly complex and costly and having the capabilities to be able to serve and support that, whether who the Alzheimer drug you just questioned or previously Ricky questioned relative to biosimilars going the other way, our Evernorth portfolio is really well-positioned to be able to create great value for society here. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Rhyee. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : Thank you. So as we wrap up here, I\u2019d like to first and foremost acknowledge Cigna\u2019s more than 70,000 colleagues around the globe, who again have worked tirelessly and with great empathy throughout this pandemic in support of those we are able to serve around the world, customers, patients and clients. Our mission at Cigna to improve the health, wellbeing and peace of mind of those we serve has never been more important and continues to guide all the actions. Specific to Evernorth, it represents an exciting new chapter for our company and along with our other growth platforms, we seek to leverage our broad suite of capabilities to create innovative and flexible solutions to tackle some of society\u2019s toughest healthcare issues and drive sustained growth. From a results perspective, we once again deliver strong results this quarter and remain on track to complete the integration of Cigna Express Scripts by the end of this calendar year. We are also well-positioned to deliver very strong revenue and EPS outlook for 2020, as well as our 2021 EPS target of $20 per share to $21 per share. With that, we thank you for joining our call. Hope everybody remains healthy and safe in these trying times. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna\u2019s third quarter 2020 results review.

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter the queue to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Ms. Alexis Jones. Please go ahead, Ms. Jones. Alexis Jones : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Alexis Jones, Lead Principal for Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's full-year 2020 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2021. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations, and adjusted revenues which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders' net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2021 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the fourth quarter, we recorded in after-tax special item benefit of $3.2 billion or $8.91 per share for sale of Cigna's Group Disability and Life business that was completed on December 31, 2020. We also recorded an after-tax special item charge of $148 million or $00.41 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Beginning next quarter, in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement, the Group Disability and Other segment will be combined with Corporate and called, Corporate and Other Operation. This change to simplify our reporting was enabled by the aforementioned sale of the Group Disability and Life business. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full-year 2021 outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the potential impact of any future share repurchases and anticipated 2021 dividend. With that, I will turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thank you, Alexis. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call today. When we met a year ago, the challenges from COVID-19 were just beginning to fully emerge around the globe. With the arrival of vaccines, 2021 is likely to be a year of transition, as communities and businesses seek to turn the page. I am very proud of the ways in which our 70,000-plus colleagues led, and continue to lead through this difficult time for customers, our clients, our providers, our partners, and our communities. Starting last spring, we were amongst the first to waive out-of-pocket costs COVID-19 testing as well as treatment. Our Evernorth business quickly leveraged our supply chain expertise to ensure a consistent prescription drug supply and delivery during the uncertain times. In our U.S. Medical Business, we ramped up to meet the significant increased demand for behavioral health services by growing our network, adding virtual provider partners, creating demand webcasts, treating first responders, and adding search capabilities for provider ethnicity. All over, we were deploying hundreds of millions of dollars to support our clients and partners who were hit hardest by the pandemic. In partnership with New York Life, we launched the Brave of Heart Fund to provide charitable grants for families, frontline workers, and volunteers who lost loved ones to COVID-19. And last month, our Cigna Medical Group was amongst the first non-hospital organizations in the nation to administer antibody therapy for high-risk COVID-19 patients, freeing up much needed hospital space. And just a few weeks ago, we partnered with industry leaders from across the public and private sectors to ensure that people who received the vaccine had digital access to the vaccination records so they can safely return to their jobs and daily activities. As we continue to work to serve our clients, our customers, and our patients during the pandemic, we also balanced our responsibility to deliver for shareholders as well. For 2020 full-year, we grew our adjusted revenue by 14%, to $160 billion. We also delivered adjusted earnings per share of $18.45, consistent with our overall expectations, which included the ongoing elevated cost of COVID-19-related services. Today, I'm going to talk about how our strategic actions we took in 2020 position each of our businesses to navigate what we expect will be another very dynamic year, one that will require us again to balance the very needs of all of our stakeholders. I'll also tell you about our growth framework and how our execution of it will drive our success throughout this challenging environment and beyond. Following my comments, Brian Evanko will share more details about our 2020 financial results and our 2021 outlook, and then we'll take your questions. At Cigna, we've been in a journey, an important one over the past two years to significantly accelerate our strategic path. During the 2020, we completed the integration of our combination with Express Scripts, and delivered on our integration priorities, including revenue growth, cash flow generation, de-leveraging targets, strong client retention, high levels of coworker retention, and working to keep our vision top of mind with innovations and improved affordability, predictability, and simplicity delivered to the market. In addition, we delivered another important milestone of our strategic journey by launching Evernorth, our health services platform, which has meaningfully grown our strategic partnerships and is bringing innovative solutions to the market already. We also made a series of leadership changes to align our capabilities and further operationalize our strategy, reinforcing our talent depth, and our commitment to continue to grow and develop our team. And based on the capital and cash flow strength of our company, we are demonstrating the ability to have [an and] [Ph] orientation to our capital deployment strategy. This means we're able to reinvest in our business for ongoing growth, and pay a meaningful quarterly dividend, and deployed substantial capital to share repurchase, and target and pursue strategic M&A. At the same time, we continue to execute effectively across each of our businesses by delivering value to our clients and customers or patients. In Evernorth, our 2020 adjusted revenue increased 20% driven by ongoing strong retention, the completion of Cigna volumes, and organic growth, including our partnership with Prime Therapeutics. In U.S. Commercial, our relentless support of our customers, and our employee clients and partners throughout the pandemic led to strong client retention levels again in 2020, along with better-than-expected in-group strength, building a solid foundation that we will carry into 2021. In U.S. Government, we grew our Medicare Advantage customer base by 18%, exceeding our annual growth target of 10% to 15%. And we expanded our geographic and product footprint to now be making market offerings in 20% of all available Medicare Advantage bio markets. In addition, 88% of Medicare Advantage and prescription drug paying customers in 2021 are in four-star plus rated plans, with our national weighted average of four-and-a-half stars, the highest amongst our national competitors. And in our International business, despite navigating the challenges of the ongoing pandemic in multiple countries, we delivered full-year adjusted earnings growth of 18% fueled by our strong partnerships. Related to Group Disability and Life, which we sold to New York Life, on December 31, I am proud of the way in which our team worked to deliver in a very challenging environment, fueled by the pandemic, for the benefit of our clients and customers. As a result of the pandemic, it created a significant reduction in our earnings contribution for our business last year. However, we remain focused on serving our clients and customers. Throughout 2021, we expect the macro environment to remain dynamic, which presents both challenges and opportunities for us. Among the challenges, we expect COVID-19 and the rollout of the vaccine to continue to tax an already overburdened healthcare system. And we expect intensified and much needed focus on health disparities to continue as well. At the same time, we also see opportunities. They include greater recognition of the importance of the employer-sponsored market with companies playing even more critical role in ensuring the wellbeing of their employees by offering comprehensive medical, pharmacy, and behavioral services. There were also a number of accelerating trends that will further drive fundamental changes in healthcare. For example, pharmacological innovations are quickly becoming the future of healthcare driven in part by the continued rise in specialty pharmaceuticals, gene therapies, and the evolution of the biosimilars. There is also a greater recognition and acceptance of the link between mental health and physical health. And we see care access rapidly changing as a result of consumer behavior and technology and data innovation leading to growing use of virtual visits and coordinated home-based care all aided by advancements in remote monitoring as well. Against this backdrop, the progress we achieved in 2020 along with the strength of our capabilities that gives us confidence that we will deliver at least $20 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021 even in the face of COVID-19 headwinds primarily in the form of elevated medical costs. Our ability to achieve these levels of continued long-term success starts with growth framework which is three fundamental building blocks. First, we delivered differentiated value in the form of affordable, predictable, simple solutions for our clients, customers, and patients. This drives our ability to retain, further deepen, and grow our business platforms. Second, we work to partner and innovate. This enables us to rapidly bring new solutions to the market that creates even more value for our clients and customers. And it also fuels our third priority, the expansion of our addressable markets which we achieve by growing our geographic footprint further, by moving it to underpenetrated markets through service coordination, and through addition of new solutions that gives us the opportunity to sell to new buyer groups. Taken together, these building blocks provide us with multiple levers to continue to achieve differentiated and sustained growth not only in 2021, but over the long-term. In Evernorth, this means bringing an expanded set of solutions to our existing health plan, commercial and government clients by leveraging the strength of our pharmacy, care management, health intelligence, and benefit management capabilities. In U.S. healthcare, this means continue outstanding retention along with further deepening relationships and target new business adds. In U.S. government, it means delivering at our goal of accelerated customer growth of 10 to 15% in Medicare Advantage. It also means continue to expand our geographic footprint in the individual exchange market where, for example, in 2021 we will be offered in 220 counties. This is a more than 50% year-over-year increase. And in International, it means continuing to grow as we deliver differentiated value for our globally mobile customers as well as our supplemental health solution customer. We look forward to delving more deeply into our growth strategy with you at our Investor Day which is slated for March 8th. So, now to summarize, I am very proud of my colleagues in our company for delivering for our customers, patients, clients, partners, and shareholders in an extraordinary year by maintaining a relentless focus on delivering on our commitments and leading through a rapidly changing landscape. Our performance is a testament to the resilience of our organization and our ability to thrive and deliver differentiated results in the most challenging of environments. We delivered strong revenue, earnings, and cash flow results in 2020. In 2021, we expect to deliver at least $20 of adjusted earnings per share. And we will continue to drive attractive operating cash flow which fuels our ability to return value to our shareholders through a meaningful quarterly dividend and through ongoing share repurchase as well targeted M&A. Overall, we have confidence that we'll achieve our 2021 outlook and our long-term growth objectives. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Evanko : Thanks, David. Good morning everyone. First if we look back at 2020, I am very proud of the actions we have taken in the company to meet the needs of our customers, clients, provider partners, communities, and coworkers while also delivering on our commitment to our shareholders. And as we enter 2021, we remain focused on delivering differentiated value and driving growth across our businesses. My remarks today, I'll review Cigna's 2020 results including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business and provide our outlook for 2021. The consolidated financial highlights for 2020 include adjusted revenue of $160 billion, adjusted earnings of $6.8 billion after-tax, adjusted earnings per share of $18.45 and operating cash flows of $10.4 billion. These results reflect strong execution across our businesses through an unprecedented environment. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Fourth quarter 2020 adjusted revenues grew to $30.5 billion and adjusted pretax earnings grew to $1.6 billion. Evernorth strong results reflect organic growth with outstanding client retention and new partnerships, effective execution of supply chain initiatives, and continued strong performance in Accredo, our industry leading specialty pharmacy. During the quarter, we fulfilled $388 million adjusted pharmacy scripts, a 19% increase for our fourth quarter 2019. Overall, Evernorth delivered a strong fourth quarter as we completed our integration efforts and we entered 2021 with good momentum. Turning to U.S. Medical, fourth quarter adjusted revenues were $9.7 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $328 million. These results reflect COVID-19 related impacts and the return of the health insurance tax. COVID-19 related impacts in the quarter include the direct costs of COVID-19 testing and treatment, the costs of actions we have taken to support customers, providers and co-workers and decreased specialty contributions partially offset by a reduction in non-COVID utilization. As we progressed through the fourth quarter, we experienced an increase in direct COVID-19 costs for testing and treatment as incidence rates spiked across the country. While we also saw increased levels of care deferral for non-COVID costs during the latter part of the quarter, the direct COVID-19 costs outweighed the impact of lower non-COVID costs. Turning to membership, we ended the year with 16.7 million total medical customers. This represents less than a 0.5% declined sequentially excluding the loss of a 240,000 life claims as expected due to an acquisition, as our book of business remains resilient. We finished the year with 18% Medicare advantage customer growth and delivered mid single-digit growth in the Select and International segments, despite a challenged economic backdrop. Overall results for Cigna's U.S. Medical segment reflects strong fundamentals and the impact of the increase in direct COVID-19 costs as we progressed through the fourth quarter. In our international markets business, fourth quarter adjusted revenues were $1.5 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $91 million, reflecting the costs of actions taken to support customers and coworkers and investments in the business for future growth. For our Group Disability and Other Operations segment, fourth quarter adjusted revenues were $1.3 billion. Fourth quarter adjusted pretax earnings for this segment were $11 million, reflecting elevated life claims related to the pandemic and unfavorable disability claims. As previously noted, we completed the sale of the Group Disability and Life Business to New York Life on December 31, 2020. For our Corporate segment, the fourth quarter adjusted loss of $381 million reflects lower interest expenses due to lower levels of outstanding debt. Overall Cigna's 2020 results reflects focused execution across each of our businesses through a dynamic environment, as we continue to meet the needs of those we serve, while delivering strong financial results. As we turned to 2021, we have entered the year with strength and momentum driven by our strategic actions in 2020, which David detail. And we expect the environment in 2021 to continue to be dynamic presenting both challenges and opportunities for our business. Before going to our detailed outlook with the sale of our Group Disability and Life Business contributions from group should be removed for the purposes of year-over-year comparisons. With that for full-year 2021, we expect consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $165 billion representing growth of approximately $10 billion after adjusting for 2020 group revenues. We expect full-year 2021 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $6.95 billion, or at least $20 per share. This is inclusive of an expected COVID-19 related headwind of approximately $1.25 per share. In 2021, we expect elevated medical costs including the impact of direct COVID-19 related costs and more normalized non-COVID utilization. And we expect impact the gradual economic recovery on our customer base in 2021. Given these COVID-19 dynamics, we expect the primary impact to be in our U.S. medical business. Further, we expect the COVID-19 headwind to be more concentrated in the first quarter of the year, and so we would expect the cadence of earnings per share in 2021 to be more weighted to the final three quarters of the year. Specifically, we expect approximately 20% to 22% of 2021 earnings per share to emerge in the first quarter of the year. For 2021, we projected expense ratio in the range of 7.5% to 8%, and a consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%. I'll now discuss our 2021 outlook for our segments. In Evernorth, we expect full-year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $5.6 billion. This represents year-over-year growth of at least 4%. In Evernorth, we expect the 2021 quarterly earnings cadence to be directionally in line with 2020. For 2021, we expect adjusted pharmacy scripts of at least $1.55 billion scripts. And we see significant opportunity to bring new innovative solutions to market through Evernorth, with less than 15% of our Evernorth revenues derived from Cigna's U.S. medical business, we have a significant external customer and client base, and we expect to continue to track the growth through existing and new Evernorth relationships. For U.S. Medical, we expect full-year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $3.8 billion. This outlook reflects focused execution in our businesses driven by organic customer growth, deepening of customer relationships and disciplined expense management. This outlook also includes the projected impact of COVID-19. As I said earlier, the COVID-19 headwind primarily impacts our U.S. medical business with the greatest impact in the earlier part of 2021. Key assumptions reflected in our U.S. medical earnings outlook for 2021 include the following. Regarding total medical customers, we expect 2021 growth of at least 325,000 customers. This includes continued organic growth throughout the year in our commercial business led by the select and middle-market segments, partially offset by lower national accounts enrollment. We also expect Medicare advantage customer growth in our target average annual growth range of 10% to 15%, and we expect growth in our individual ACA business, which will be largely offset by our exit of our legacy non-ACA individual market offerings. We expect the 2021 medical care ratio to be in the range of 81% to 82% reflecting the impacts in 2021 of elevated medical costs including the impact of direct COVID-19 related costs and more normalized non-COVID utilization, the repeal of the health insurance tax effective for 2021, and continued focus execution and delivery of strong clinical quality across our U.S. commercial and government businesses. We also expect continued contributions from international markets. As we continue to deliver differentiated solutions that improve the health, wellbeing and peace of mind of those reserves in our global markets. Regarding interest expense, we expect costs of approximately $1.3 billion pre-tax in 2021. All in for full-year 2021, we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of at least $6.95 billion or at least $20 per share. Overall, these expected results reflect the differentiated value, strength and strategic positioning of our businesses, as we deliver growth while navigating the headwind associated with COVID-19. Now, turning to our capital management position and outlook, we expect our businesses to continue to drive exceptional cash flow with strong returns on capital, even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. In 2020, we deployed $4.7 billion to repay debt and we repurchased 21.9 million shares of stock for $4.1 billion. We ended 2020 with the debt to capitalization ratio of 39.5% and improvement of 570 basis points over year-end 2019 as we met our de-leveraging targets of a debt to capitalization ratio of less than 40%. Now, framing our capital outlook for 2021, we entered 2021 with $2.5 billion of deployable capital from our strong cash flow generation in 2020, and the remaining proceeds of the Group sale, net of the expected debt repayment we announced on deal close. For 2021, we expect at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well-performing businesses. Combined, this gives us at least $10 billion to deploy in 2021, and positions us well to execute against our 2021 capital deployment priorities. First, we expect approximately $1 billion in tax payments and expenditures resulting from the Group sale. We also expect to deploy approximately $1 billion to capital expenditures primarily focused on technology to drive future growth. We expect to deploy approximately $1.4 billion to shareholder dividends, in line with our January quarterly dividend announcement. And we expect to largely deploy the remaining $6.6 billion for share repurchase and strategic M&A. Year-to-date, as of February 3, 2021, we have already repurchased 4.2 million shares for $906 million. For the purpose of the planning and 2021 earnings per share guidance, our outlook reflects the deployment of the vast majority of the $6.6 billion to share repurchase. Regarding M&A, we look for opportunities that are both strategically and financially attractive. And we would evaluate a given opportunity on its merits. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins, and attractive returns on capital. So to recap, our full-year 2020 consolidated results reflect strong execution led by our Evernorth segment. We enter 2021 with momentum. And we are confident in our ability to deliver our full-year 2021 earnings outlook. Further, we strategically positioned our businesses to leverage our growth framework, and to be service-based and capital light. This positioning drives significant financial strength and flexibility, and gives us continued confidence in our long-term growth targets. With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of our call. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Evanko. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Gary Taylor with JP Morgan. Mr. Taylor, your line is open. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. Appreciate the details. I just want to go back to sort of thinking about the COVID headwinds this year. And I know '22 is a far way away, but from this distance should we be thinking about $20.00 plus $1.25, and then putting your long-term growth rate on that. Is there any reason not to sort of generally be thinking about that as the setup for 2022? David Cordani : Gary, good morning, it's David. As Brian noted, we estimate the $1.25 for 2021. Big picture, we think you should view it as transient or removable. I'd caution you from, at this early stage, penciling all of it as an immediate return in 2022. But to be very clear, we do believe it is removable or recoverable from that standpoint through a variety of forces. One, obviously the effectiveness and the ramping of the vaccine that will transpire from that standpoint; two, further evolution of both programs and services, as well as treatments and therapies relative to dealing with COVID, and then third, ultimately, if necessary, pricing actions activities. So big picture, agree with your conclusion. We'd just caution you not to harden it fully 100% into a 2022 number yet. Gary Taylor : Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Taylor. Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open, sir. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, great, thanks. And I guess the dynamic that you saw in Q4 around elevated medical costs kind of more than offsetting the decline in [indiscernible] this a little bit different than what we've seen from other companies, but I guess directionally similar with commentary about the impact to commercial versus Medicare. I guess maybe since you are kind of more commercially focused, maybe you could help draw a little bit of a distinction between how you expect utilization in the commercial business to rebound in 2021? Is there less pent up demand than what you might see in the Medicare business, and therefore commercial gets to more normal more quickly in 2021 than other business lines, just wanted to get your thoughts on that given your performance versus your peers in Q4. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Kevin, it's Brian. So just a few kind of framing comments, and then I'll get to the core of your question. Throughout 2020, as the pandemic emerged, we certainly did witness an inverse relationship between COVID-19 claims and deferred care. And if you step back all the way to the second quarter of 2020, the impact to care deferrals more than outweighed the direct costs associated with COVID-19 claims for testing and treatment across both our commercial and Medicare businesses. During the third quarter, these factors approximately offset one another, meaning the cost to COVID claims approximately offset the effective care deferrals. In the fourth quarter specifically, as the back half of the quarter emerged, we started to see the cost of COVID-19 claims for both testing and treatment start to exceed the benefits we were seeing from increased care deferral activity. And so we ended the quarter with performance of medical costs in aggregate that was modestly above our seasonal baseline. That effect was consistent across both the commercial and the Medicare book-to-business. Although I would note that the commercial care deferrals were lower than the Medicare care deferrals that we saw in the fourth quarter. So that's the way I would encourage you to think about it. And as we roll that forward into 2021, our guidance contemplates the respective books-to-business in the $1.25 headwind. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question is from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open, sir. Matt Borsch : Yes, thank you. Maybe if I could just ask a question on that prior dialogue. So do I have it right that in Medicare you're actually seeing the direct costs of COVID as higher than the deferral in the fourth quarter, and if so do you expect that to continue into 2021? Brian Evanko : Morning, Matt. This is Brian. So yes, you have that right. For the fourth quarter we did see the direct cost of COVID-19 testing and treatment exceed the benefits of care deferral for the quarter in aggregate, with the back half of the quarter where the acceleration really occurred. I would note though that the fourth quarter also saw elevated care deferral relative to the third quarter in Medicare. And again, as we roll that forward stepping into 2021, we assume that the first portion of the year there will be elevated medical cost experienced in our book of business across U.S. Medical. And then as the year unfolds that will gradually dissipate toward the back half of the year. Matt Borsch : Yes. And sorry, just one clarification, I'm trying to isolate Medicare, and not looking for any specific guidance but directionally Medicare. Just Medicare, to understand it in that book in the fourth quarter, it was the deferrals were less than treatment costs, and if that's expected to continue this year? Brian Evanko : In the fourth quarter, both our commercial and Medicare businesses in aggregate saw total claim costs that were modestly above the seasonal baseline. Matt Borsch : Okay, thank you. Brian Evanko : [Technical difficulty]\u2026 Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Borsch. Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open, sir. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning. Last year, you had talked about a potential opportunity to go back to customers and maybe take some risk off the table for them for 2021. I'm not sure if that program resonated or not and whether that had any impact on the guidance. And maybe if there are considerations around your stop loss book specifically for this year that we need to consider in terms of what's baked into the guidance. Thanks. David Cordani : Ralph, good morning. It's David. I think what you're reflecting back on is, as the pandemic, the breath and magnitude of it began to take hold and become obvious, we made the decision as an organization that we would seek to return all the favorable economics that were manifested because of COVID disruption to clients, customers, patients, our provider partners, and our coworkers. So you're reflecting back to that. We did take proactive action throughout the course of the year to work with clients, that's a client-by-client set of actions depending on the client's position, desire, funding mechanisms, et cetera, to both return value in absolute sense, and in some cases restructure programs with an eye toward 2021. In some cases you could think about the, call it, the risk sharing relationship with those clients may have moved somewhat depending, again, on the clients' preference. But that's again a client-by-client call. To the latter portion of your comment, I would say there's no meaningful different between stop loss either structure or performance expectation for 2020 versus 2021. And we continue to feel very good about the way stop loss is performing for piece of mind for our clients, as well as for ourselves. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. Our next question is from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir. Robert Jones : Great, thanks for the question. And maybe just on Evernorth and the guidance. If I look at this $5.6 billion of operating profit expectation, it doesn't seem like it bakes in too much underlying growth, if I'm thinking about this right. So I just wanted to talk through some of the pieces. And if you account for the expected benefit from the Anthem overhead costs rolling off, some of the incremental deal synergies, the Prime Scripts, just want to make sure I'm thinking about the underlying business there correctly, and what you guys are assuming the kind of organic underlying growth could be in this business for '21? David Cordani : Good morning. It's David. So let me start, I'll ask Brian to add some additional specificity. Stepping back relative to the Evernorth platform, we're delighted. We're really pleased with the performance, the growth that is being realized because of the value that's being delivered to our clients. Our commercial clients, our helpline clients, our government clients, from that standpoint. Two is, to put a pin in it, this is specifically relative to transit overhead, we were able to more rapidly accelerate the extraction of this transit overhead largely because of executing our efficiency initiatives, but also the significant growth. So this transit overhead extraction was more accelerated from its initiation in 2019 through 2020. Third point, before I hand it over the Brain, I would just ask you to recognize the fact that we continue to invest significantly because of the rate and pace of growth in the business as we are continuing to add significant business to that portfolio, and we've called out before, investments that are being made relative to OpEx, largely operating expenses, to add our first phase of our Prime relationship. Now, we're evolving the second phase of the Prime relationship, and we're delighted to do so. And that will take place throughout the totality of 2021, while reinforcing the growth in the underlying strength. Meanwhile successfully continuing to grow earnings in line with our prior strategic target, we will look forward to providing you some additional insight relative to the forward-looking both revenue and earnings trajectory of that business at our investor day. Brian, some adds? Brian Evanko : The only comment I'd add on top of this, to remind you, Robert, that the 2020 performance, when you exclude transitioning clients it showed 20% revenue growth in Evernorth, and 22% growth in adjusted pharmacy scripts year-on-year. So coming off a very strong year in 2020, and stepping into 2021 with continued momentum. Robert Jones : That's fair. Thanks so much for the comments. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Jones. Our next question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir. Mr. Lake, are you on mute? Moving on to our next question from George Hill with Deutsche Bank, your line is open, sir. George Hill : Yes, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I guess as we think about the $1.25 headwind for calendar '21, are you able to give us an order of magnitude on what is the gross impact of the COVID headwind versus the gross impact of the expectations for reduced medical claims and reduced medical costs, that would be helpful, thank you. Brian Evanko : Morning, George. It's Brian. So I appreciate the question, and the nature of the way you structured it. I'm going to approach it maybe a little bit differently, but hopefully this will get at what you're looking for here. As we do mention the $1.25, I would encourage you to think about it in three broad categories. The first one being the impact of elevated COVID-19 testing, treatment, and vaccination costs, as well as some of the pressure we anticipate in our revenue, for example, in our Medicare business. I would size that at about half of the $1.25. In fact, as it relates to the 2021 effect on our U.S. Medical book. And you'll see that primarily in the medical care ratio, or the MCR. The second component that's sizable is in customer volumes, again specifically in our U.S. Medical business, we would expect about 35% to 40% or so of that $1.25 to show up in the form of lower volumes due to the ongoing economic pressures associated with the pandemic and then the balance is smaller components that will show up in different parts of the company. George Hill : Okay, maybe as a quick follow-up, is there any impact expected to the Evernorth segment? David Cordani : The Evernorth impact is quite modest. I would characterize it's immaterial relative to the size of that business. George Hill : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Hill. Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Mr. Goldwasser, are you on mute? Moving on to our next question from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse, your line is open, sir. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Just to ask about Evernorth, two aspects there, one with now enhanced capital for deployment. It seems like part of the story for Evernorth is diversifying the service offering beyond the pharmacy benefit focus that it currently has. Can you comment on how quickly and you think you can diversify and maybe update us on the areas that you're thinking about adding to the capability there and then just base it on Evernorth, there was some talk last year that the PBM selling season, people were renewing for a year because of the pandemic. And do you expect the selling season to have more RFPs than normal this year? Or is it sort of a normal RFP season from what you're seeing so far? David Cordani : A.J. good morning, it's David. Relative to your first question, the platforms that we're operating within Evernorth and again, we'll walk through it in some good detail at our Investor Day, there are four platforms within that portfolio are well performing pharmacy services, our care management or benefit management or health intelligence platforms that are functioning, operating, delivering significant value today, and each one of which we'll continue to be invested in first and foremost, organically. Brian referenced the CapEx deployment that we have within our portfolio and Evernorth is a part user of that $1 billion CapEx. Secondly, through partnerships, the way we work to partner in different ways, shapes and forms and thirdly, potentially, through M&A from that standpoint. But the platforms we have we feel quite good about as an illustration in terms of the M&A capabilities we've talked about expanding our ability to serve customers, where they are, and where they seek to be served, whether that's expanded virtual platforms, expanded in-home capabilities, et cetera through that lens. As it relates to your second question, the selling season et cetera grounded in the comments we made relative to just the very strong growth results we've put up over multiple years now. We'll be able to carry that momentum through 2021. We're pretty thick into the 2022 selling season right now. The health plan season is far along, the large commercial season is meaningfully along, and the middle market consortium selling season is in the early stages. As of right now we know we have two health plan losses for 2022. We've had essentially 99% plus retention up until that point for our health plan business and we would like to retain every client every day. And we know that that's not possible. But we have two no losses that have been written about in the marketplace. Notwithstanding that, we have visibility to meaningful new business ads from the 2022 selling season and we'll be able to continue to build on the momentum we posted for 2019 and 2020. A.J. Rice: Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rice. Our next question is from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Your line is open sir. Dave Windley : Hi, good morning. I'm hoping to hear David how central and important telemedicine is to Cigna and Cigna's strategy, thinking about how are you baking that into product design? How are you thinking about extended higher reimbursement deferral of patient copay, and does like remote passive digital monitoring of high risk patients fold into that picture, I'd just love to hear you talk about how central that is and how much say Cigna is pushing that as opposed to waiting on customers to pull that from you? David Cordani : So, good morning. It's interesting the way you ended in terms of push pull. We've talked before around our orientation is being we think about ourself as a consultative solution provider. So I pause a little bit on the push side of the equation, but stepping back, your framing I think is quite healthy. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we see the change in which care will be accessed and coordinated is one of the three defining trends over the decade in front of us. And we see significant opportunity to be clear. So let me agree, we see significant opportunity to deliver more value, more choice, more simplicity, with appropriate coordination back to customers and patients through effective use of virtual programs. This is well beyond telemedicine, it's well beyond Urgent Care triaging. There's longitudinal nature that is attached to that, it is aided by remote monitoring, it is aided by a coordinated system to make that longitudinal delivery work. We see this transcending from healthcare through behavioral health to coordinated health care and behavioral health services from that standpoint, and we see it as a significant opportunity. I'd also note that, we've been mindful in terms of the positioning of the corporation whereby we see that as not only a significant opportunity in the market, but for us, because we've sought not be positioned in, we'll call it bricks and mortar delivery or fixed delivery infrastructure, but having the flexibility of the variable delivery infrastructure that is aided for clients. And then lastly, we do see your point, you have the ability to design benefits; you have a virtual primary benefit structure that are being tested in the marketplace today. And you can push that, you can put that in the push category, but it's a choice that you would offer. And we've already seen some positive markers. So a significant opportunity, our company is positioned to pursue it. And you should expect us to spotlight this in a little bit more detail on March 8. Dave Windley : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Windley. Our next question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir. Justin Lake : Thanks. Can you hear me this time? David Cordani : Yes, we can, Justin. Justin Lake : Sorry about that. So couple quick numbers question, one the Evernorth revenues were materially higher than at least I was modeling yet it didn't seem to flow through to the bottom line in terms of earnings, which were more in line. So curious there, if there's anything I'm missing, and then on the exchange business, can you give us an update of a lot of competition there, I know you're rolling into a bunch of new markets, can you share with us how much new membership you expect to have there and any kind of margin impact, kind of versus typical targets that we should think about for '21? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Justin. It's Brian. I'll take the first part of your question, then, David will comment on the individual exchange part. In terms of the Evernorth business really pleased with the revenue performance that we drove in 2020, and your comment about the relationship to the earnings, couple of things I would keep in mind there. One is the relationship that came out with Prime Therapeutics, effective April 1st, and that became expanded on January 1, 2021. When we onboard any new clients, there's a level of startup cost associated with that, as we think about bringing on new headcount to make sure that we're ramped-up for the volumes that will come. So we had a little bit of expense related to the startup associated with our relationship with Prime Therapeutics in 2020. Additionally, the Cigna U.S. medical insourcing, which is now complete, brought revenue, but deminimis earnings contribution in 2020 to Evernorth. So those are really the two dynamics that caused a little bit of the revenue versus earnings growth difference that you think, David anything you want to call out relative to the individual business? David Cordani : Sure, Justin, good morning, relative to the business. First, we're pleased with the performance that we're stepping into 2021 with rolls to that portfolio. As I noted in our prepared remarks, we're expanding to counties, we're participating in by about 50%. Brian did also note that we're exiting the non-ACA portion of that business. As it relates to margins, Justin, I would remind you, we were early to note that a couple of years ago, we thought that that portfolio of businesses nationally was earning margins above a sustainable margin threshold and we said targets have to revert to a sustainable marketing threshold. And in fact, the MCR we posted this year, we indicate it would show some impact of the margins, more normalizing and that indeed to take place. As it relates to the 2021 and beyond positioning, we think that our margin targets are sustainable, given our provider relationships and our service proposition and we look to grow that portfolio. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question is from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open. Steven Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good morning. So if you think about the commercial membership, like you mentioned you expect continued organic growth throughout the year in overall commercial membership. Curious if we can read into that maybe that Cigna is perhaps already troughed on the quarterly progression of commercial enrollment as it relates to COVID impact, economic impact etcetera. And then just within that with national accounts expect that to be down a little bit, any sense on when we may see the trough on that, whether it's early in the year or late in a year in 2021. Thanks. David Cordani : Good morning. It's David. I think you've identified several important features there. So, as it relates to commercial customers for 2021, as we expected to step into 2021 with about the number of customers we would end 2020 with, as relates to the years pattern. I'd ask you to think about it as follows. First, we expect the ongoing COVID impact to disenrollment to continue to have pressure on customers throughout the first-half of 2000, our customer number-- throughout the first-half of 2021. Second, as typically takes place in the national accounts segment, there are some non-COVID related disenrollment that happens historically in that business because most of the selling takes place during the first portion of the year. Offsetting that is continued growth and strength in the Select segment that has a very active selling season throughout the course of the year as well as some known middle market and new business ads that will take place during the middle portion of the year. Now, as it relates to looking forward, you asked the final part of your question relative to the trough in national accounts. Our early look at 2022 is we would expect a very attractive retention number at this point for our U.S. medical national account relationships, as well as the selling season has been pretty active right now for us. The RP volume is up. The quality of the RP volume is high. We have some new business opportunities wins that we have on board already. And we're an active pursuit. So we have a level of optimism relative to the outlook for that segment for January of 2022. Steven Valiquette : That's great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Mr. Goldwasser you are on mute. Moving on to our next question from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research, your line is open. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Congrats, David and Brian, and the rest of the team on the new roles. So our question here is more around Cigna was relatively early in sort of that development of an ACO strategy. It seems like the market is certainly been catching up quickly. So was wondering if you could speak to your efforts around engaging providers, especially primary care physicians and maybe perhaps how that approach differs in your Medicare book versus your commercial book? David Cordani : Good morning Josh. Josh Raskin : Good morning. David Cordani : So, relative to the ACO strategy, I think that's a broad definition of what the market calls value-based relationships and you're correct, we had an early start and a lot of passion and drive and therefore strategic direction relative to it. I would start with the end and that is the Medicare advantage book in general has a higher penetration of a comprehensive nature of value-based care relationships per customer that we serve versus commercial. So and you probably see that in other ways, you look at the marketplace, the primary care physicians integrated, multi-specialty physician groups, et cetera, tend to adapt many internalize value based care, more comprehensively for Medicare advantage given the population's health needs and the opportunity to deliver really significant value. The exciting and piece of it is we've been working now for a decade to prove that thesis in the commercial space. It varies by market in terms of the level of breadth and depth, but we have well in excess of 600 collaborative accountable care relationships that are up and running and delivering meaningful value. The more mature ones are delivering meaningful value for customers and clients. What does that mean? Clinical quality, so higher gaps in care closure, service quality, strong service experience, and improved affordability from that standpoint. And then the last comment I would add here is the market is always dynamic, but one of the impacts of COVID-19 is it, it jars everybody in every norm and as it relates to value based care, it puts a spotlight back on value-based care that shared risk and shared performance relationships. Now may look a little bit more palatable to some that may have not viewed it in the past and were more white to a fee-for-service model. So, we see an opportunity to further expand and deepen some of those relationships both in commercial specifically, but as well as in some of the Medicare advantage opportunities. Josh Raskin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question is from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Your line is open. Charles Rhyee : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask again about the direct cover cost in this year in this $1.25 and [indiscernible] you gave it, but is there a way to give a split between maybe testing cost relative to treatment cost in that number that you expect this year? And I think there has been some talk about potential for changing rules where plans would be required to cover additional testing cost like about return-to-work kind of cost I think plans are currently covering, just wanted to get your sense first on that first part. And then, secondly, is that a big amount that you -- if that were to happen, how big amount is that in the testing scheme overall? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Charles. This is Brian. So in terms of the first part of your question there, dimensioning the test versus the treatment, we have gone through extensive modeling as you might imagine to project what we think is going to transpire in 2021, which led us to $1.25 COVID impact that described earlier. And as I went through to a previous question, we expect about half of that to come through in the form of elevated claim cost and/or revenue pressure in our U.S. Medical MCR book. So I am not going to split apart each of the different components in that for you. But just rest assured we've got a variety of projections that underlie that. So, David, maybe you want to comment on the effects of some other components? David Cordani : So, related to testing as we stand today first and foremost, the industry broadly speaking stepped in early clear and aggressively in support of clients and patients related to testing initially as well as evolving through process, procedures related to treatment. As it relates to what I would describe as unmed or worksite support, the posture has been thus far in term -- and good collaboration with HHS, I mean [indiscernible] staff, but that is outside of what an insurance or a service relationship should be. To the extent that we visited, we visited dynamically. But, that's typically carried by the employer through an unmed relationship or otherwise. It also reminds you that 85% of our commercial business is self-funded. So, we act as a fiduciary. I mean in cases where individual employers want assistance relative to that, we're proactively supporting through that lens. But we do not see that as (a), likely in the immediate future even relative to engagement on these topics this week, or (b), a needle mover for us given the makeup of our portfolio of businesses. Charles Rhyee : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rhyee. Our next question is from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Your line is open. Lance Wilkes : Yes, good morning, Brian and David. So let me just pull up a little on the strategic capital deployment, and if you could just talk to maybe two dimensions on that? Appreciate your earlier comments. As you were talking about bricks and mortar being of less interest and specifying of the areas in virtual home and remote monitoring et cetera that were of interest, maybe you can just call out the distinction? Maybe I am putting too emphasis on physician practice as being bricks and mortar and excluding them as an area of focus. And then similarly if it's in Evernorth, will be more focused on providing these services to employers and health plans? Or, how much of the focus is providing these services to risk bearing primary care or other value based care sorts of companies? Thank you. David Cordani : Hey, Lance. Good morning. It's David. I'll start with the latter portion of your question first. So, as we evolve our capabilities both the present states, but evolve our capabilities, you should think about in general all that happens within Evernorth. It happens within Evernorth as it relates to a platform of services to serve health plans, to serve corporate clients, to serve governmental agencies, and to offer services to, as you articulated, risk bearing or performance based healthcare delivery systems. And you should think about Cigna's U.S. Medical portfolio as a consumer of those services. Now clearly an important development partner, but a consumer of those services as another client of Evernorth. As it relates to the first portion of your question, I think your basic framing of it is right. And so, if just reiterate it and step it up a notch, our view is that the U.S. is not in need of more physical proximity and physical plant to serve the population in general, especially in urban and suburban areas. We obviously have additional need states relative to rural areas in that standpoint. Secondly, the consumer behavior in a variety of areas including healthcare has reinforced desire not an acceptance, but a desire for bringing care and services to me in a real-time basis in a highly personalized basis, therefore virtual care coordination, and obviously that's augmented with clinical staff, but it's bringing the service to the individual and an immediate real-time basis so long as it could be longitudinally managed and coordinated effectively. And then, the last point I want to be really clear on, our view of it is as a complimentary aspect to the care delivery system, not as addition to remediation play, but as a complimentary aspect, because to make it work properly, it needs to be connected back into the healthcare delivery system. And we have many examples of it working today in our approach to virtual, both for medical as well as behavioral. We just see the ability to ramp it significantly given both the demand and the acceptance, and then the tool availability. Lance Wilkes : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Wilkes. Our last question will come from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open, sir. Scott Fidel : Okay. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I had a question just maybe helping us to think about the Medicare advantage margin progression that you're thinking about for 2021 in 2022 and particular maybe if you can call out, I don't know maybe within that $25 headwind from COVID just how you're, what you're thinking specifically about the impact from the lower raps in 2022, which I guess would probably impacting you a bit more just because of all the enrollment growth, the 18% growth that you had in MA just last year, but then as we go into 2022 how much sort of improvement in margin you could potentially get as you normalize the raps. And then also it looks like we have a pretty solid base rate update from CMS as well in terms of that 4% plus. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Scott. It's Brian. A few components to your question there, and just broadly the way I would encourage you to think about it is, we're on a multi-year growth turning for this business, right? And we're a year or two of our geographic and product expansion with the expectation of 10% to 15% annual growth. Really happy with the 18% growth we put up in '20. AND well on track to achieve 10% to 15% and '21. The margin profile tends to vary for a few different reasons. One is when we go into a new market, there tends to be a build-up in terms of investments, in people, in marketing before the customers start to come in. Two is when we rate a new customer, typically there's a bit of a ramp relative to profitability from a durational standpoint due to the risk adjustment coding, which you've appropriately called out. Thirdly, due to the unique nature of 2020 and the COVID-19 headwinds that we faced, the results of lower utilization, right? So as a result of that, we were not able to get all of the risk adjustment codes that we would in a normal year, if you will. We factored all that in due to 2021 outlook, the $1.25 earnings per share headwinds that we've called out here. A component to that is associated with Medicare advantage and it's associated with lower revenue that we would have otherwise anticipated having. So, as you kind of step forward as David said in the beginning 2022 and thereafter, we expect some of that will work itself out. And we're not going to give you exact 2022 guidance here today, that's the way I would encourage you to think about the margin profile. Scott Fidel : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fidel. I will now turn conference back over to Mr. David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : Thank you. So just to wrap up, I'd like to highlight a few key points from today's discussion. First, I'm very proud of the way in which our colleagues supported the needs of our stakeholders throughout this pandemic, while also ensuring that we delivered on our shareholder commitment. We delivered solid 2020 financial results, including revenue and EPS growth and outstanding free cash flow. And our strong 2020 performance and the strength of our businesses give us confidence that we will achieve continued attractive growth in 2021 and beyond driven by a significant increase in revenue, ongoing profit growth, and very attractive cash flow performance. We thank you for joining our call today, and we look forward to going into more depth with you around our growth plans at our Investor Day, which is slated for March 8. Have a good day.

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter the queue to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Ms. Alexis Jones. Please go ahead, Ms. Jones. Alexis Jones : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Alexis Jones, Lead Principal for Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's first quarter 2021 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2021. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations, and adjusted revenues which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders' net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2021 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the first quarter, we recorded an after-tax special item benefit of $1.1 million or $0.29 per share related to debt extinguishment costs incurred during the period, as well as after tax special item charge of $22 million or $0.06 per for integration and transaction related cost. We also recorded an after tax special benefit of $21 million or $0.06 per share related to charges associated with litigation matters. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues and our discussion of financial results. As previously noted, as a result of the sale of the group disability and life business, in our first quarter earnings release and quarterly financial supplement, corporate and other operations combines the results previously reported as corporate and the segment previously reported as group disability and others. In our security filings, the segment previously reported as group disability and others is now reported as other operation. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full-year 2021 outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2021 dividend. And excludes the impact of any business combinations or divestitures that may occur after today, such as our recently announced planned divestiture of the Texas Medicaid business, which we expect to close in the second half of 2021. With that, I will turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks, Alexis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call today. But today's we meet our environment remains highly dynamic with COVID-19 continues to affect the world, our industry and our economy. At Cigna, this rapidly changing landscape has only reinforced the tremendous responsibility we have to improve the health, wellbeing and peace of mind of those we serve. This remains the primary focus that drives our 70,000 co-workers each and every day. And it's the reason we work to continue to deliver for our customers, clients, patients, partners and our communities, all while delivering strong financial results for you, our shareholders. During the first quarter, we delivered adjusted revenue of $41 billion and adjusted EPS of $4.73 per share. We also deployed significant capital to our investors through share repurchase and the payment of a meaningful quarterly dividend, reinforcing the strength of our capital like framework. Building on our conversation from several weeks ago at our Investor Day, today, I'm going to talk more about how we are continuing to navigate through the current environment to balance and meet the needs of all of our stakeholders, our ability to consistently deliver strong results by executing on a growth framework and the competence we have in achieving our increased outlook by delivering differentiated and sustained growth for the long term. Then Brian will share more details about our first quarter results and our 2021 outlook. And after that, we'll take your questions. Since we last met at our Investor Day in March, the macro landscape remains fluid. In the U.S. proposed legislation as well as regulation and executive actions to expand extend and further support both public and private programs. Globally, social and political tensions remain high as COVID-19 with its multiple variants continue to take a toll on a number of countries, such as India, where cases have again dramatically spiked. All these forces are shaping healthcare and influencing the political and economic landscape around the world. At Cigna, we are navigating through this environment by continue to innovate for and support our stakeholders with COVID-19 services, while also executing other strategies to make healthcare more affordable, predictable and simple For U.S. commercial customers, we're ensuring they get the preventative care they need, including mammographies, colonoscopies, cervical cancer screenings, and childhood immunizations, which today are consistent with pre pandemic levels, reflecting the continued strength of our clinical programs, and proven engagement capabilities. Within Evernorth, for those customers served by Express Scripts home delivery, we've delivered further improvements in medication adherence for people with diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. At the same time, we're also supporting the mental wellbeing of our customers. We're doing this through our own best-in-class capabilities where for example, we engage with oncology patients with comorbidities by spending an average of $2,000 on their behavioral health care, we can save an average of $20,000 in avoidable costs. And we can innovate and leverage our strategic partnerships, including, for example, with Ginger, through Cigna ventures, which provides industry leading on demand 24x7 behavioral health coach and further extending our behavioral health access for the benefit of our customers. We're also leveraging data in actionable intelligence to understand the most common long term complications of COVID-19 infection, then building predictive models to determine who is at greatest risk of becoming a COVID law hauler, so we can quickly provide targeted case management and behavioral health services, as well as other resources to help our customers regain their health. For our clients, we're serving as a trusted partner. by supplying additional physical and behavioral health assistance to aid in the recovery for employees who are infected by COVID-19. We're helping employers build their own communities of immunity by assisting them in launching vaccination clinics. And we're collecting our data and analytics help employers determine when and how it is safe for employees to return to work. For provider partners, we're working to guide people to the most effective sites of care and further closing gaps in care with our clinical teams and our virtual capabilities. For coworkers, we're supporting them in this highly disruptive environment by for example, providing $200 incentive for co-workers who choose to become vaccinated for COVID-19 and continuing to offer expanded leave capabilities with our emergency time off program to provide flexibility necessitated by the current conditions. And finally, for our communities, we're taking steps to address social determinants of health. For example, we all know the alarming statistics on the disproportionate impact COVID-19 has had on communities of color. As part of our safe initiative, we brought additional underground resources to target communities by launching COVID-19 awareness campaigns, distributing PP&E kits, dispatching our health improvement mobile resources to help you administer free flu shots and provide healthy meal, as well as other support. Similarly, we're leaning in to fight breast cancer with disparities, for example, well, amongst black women remain startling, tough to address this disparity gap, we again went directly into communities. Starting in Tennessee, for example, where we collaborated with local partners to offer mobile mammography vans at churches, and at other local neighborhood locations. At Cigna, balancing the needs of our stakeholders is deeply rooted in our corporate purpose. We constantly challenge ourselves by asking the basic question, what more could we do to help us stay focused on delivering each and every day for the benefit of our customers, our clients, patients and our partners. Against this backdrop, the strength of our foundation propels us forward and guides our growth. As we share with you at our Investor Day, through our three growth platforms Evernorth, U.S. Medical and International Markets, we are well positioned to leverage the three trends we see shaping healthcare into the future, specifically, pharmacological innovations, the rising demand for coordinated mental and physical health services, and the changing preferences as it relates to access to care models. And through a proven framework, we're able to drive attractive sustained growth by delivering differentiated value within our portfolio of integrated, coordinated endpoint solutions, continuing to work to partner and innovate, and working to expand our addressable markets. As a result, we're off to a strong start in 2021, with strong fundamental execution, and the strategic and capital flexibility to further our momentum into the future. During the first quarter Evernorth continue to build on its differentiated and steady performance it had delivered throughout the pandemic, by evolving the healthcare experience for our customers and clients through continuous innovation, and by building investing, and strengthening our strategic partnerships. For example, in January, we further expanded our partnership with Prime Therapeutics by leveraging our home delivery and Accredo Specialty Pharmacy to drive greater value and delivering our promise to make healthcare more affordable. We're also advancing our strategic capabilities with our MDLIVE acquisition which closed last month. This acquisition will expand Evernorth's cares ability to further broaden access, lower cost of care, and strategically positioned us to grow in the rapidly changing access to care environment. At the same time, Evernorth pharmacy is also driving affordability improvement. One example is our patient assurance program, which caps the cost of prescriptions for patients with diabetes. During the quarter the number of patients in this program increased by 64%. And the value of patients delivered from this program is on track to more than double what we achieved last year. Turning to our U.S. medical platform, we see bright spots and growth in our U.S. commercial portfolio. For example, we continue to take share in the Select segment, which includes employers with 51 to 500 employees. As clients continue to value our integrated, align, self funded, medical, pharmacy behavioral and stop-loss programs. And more broadly, we're driving value by bringing differentiated offerings to market fueled by innovations and advancements we are accessing from our Evernorth capabilities, particularly in areas of pharmacy services, and behavioral health. Through our willingness to strategically partner with innovative companies like Oscar, we're also well positioned to take advantage of market growth opportunities in the small employer market, a market we view is currently being underserved. As a result, we expect to see an uptick in growth in our U.S. Commercial platform during the residual part of this year. Additionally, one important impact of the pandemic is that businesses have expanded access to support services for the employees, backing is a trusted source of information and providing an extended range of benefits to support whole person health. As more and more employers recognize the critical link between mental and physical health. In the wake of COVID-19, more employers are also recognizing the connection between healthy workers, higher productivity and a growing economy. In fact, the National Bureau of Economic Research found that in the U.S., we benefited by $1.5 trillion of value by having employers play a major role in health care. This reinforces the critical role, our U.S. healthcare business plays as an important partner to employers in providing access to quality, affordable care for the benefit of their employees. Turning to U.S. government business, we're driving strong year-over-year customer growth by continuing to expand our addressable markets. The number of Medicare Advantage customers increased by 11% year-over-year reflecting the ongoing execution of our strategy, as well as our sustained strong star performance. And the number of customers in our individual and family plan business grew by 17% year over year, driven by our geographic expansion, and the introduction of new plans that provide expanded coverage for maintenance drugs, to further improve affordability for customers with certain chronic conditions. In our International Markets business, we're focused on actively supporting our co workers, customers and partners around the world who continue to be impacted by COVID-19. For example, in India, our foundation is providing financial support through UNICEF to meet the critical needs on the ground, including additional rapid testing capabilities and expanded access to vaccines. And we're providing matching gifts from the Cigna foundation to our co-workers who donate to charities in India. Staying true to our mission is not only the right thing to do, it reinforced to our clients, our customers and our patients, our commitment to make a difference in the moments that matter most. Our purpose driven orientation, together with our strategic flexibility created by our service based model and recapitalize framework that generates significant cash flow from operations, as well as our track record of strong financial performance, where we delivered a 15% adjusted EPS compounded growth rate over the last decade, all give us confidence we will continue to sustainably grow in both the short term and the long term in this dynamic environment. And now taking into account the strength of our first quarter results, we expect our full year adjusted EPS to be at least $20.20 in 2021. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver our long term targets of average annual adjusted revenue growth of 6% to 8%, average annual adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 13% and continue to play an attractive dividend while delivering cumulative operating cash flow growth of $50 billion through 2025. Now to briefly summarize, we delivered strong first quarter results by executing our growth framework, while harnessing our capital strength to deploy meaningful capital for the benefit of our shareholders, reinvesting in our business, and leveraging our strategic flexibility to continue to innovate and adapt, all of which sets us up for sustained long term success. We remain confident in our ability to continue to grow as we focus our efforts to make healthcare more affordable, predictable and simple each and every day. Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Evanko : Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's first quarter results, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business, and I'll discuss their updated outlook for the full year. Key consolidated financial highlights for first quarter 2021 include adjusted revenue of $41 billion, adjusted earnings of $1.7 billion after tax and adjusted earnings per share of $4.73. Results in the first quarter reflects strong top line growth with contributions across our businesses. And first quarter earnings came in somewhat ahead of our expectations. The favorable first quarter earnings were primarily driven by strong Evernorth performance, favorable net investment income, and favorable prior year medical cost development, partially offset by non-recurring operating expenses. Our results reflect our ability to deliver a dynamic, rapidly evolving environment, including navigating the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding our segments, our first comment on Evernorth. First quarter 2021, adjusted revenues grew to $30.6 billion and adjusted pretax earnings grew to $1.2 billion. Evernorth strong results in the quarter were driven by effective execution of supply chain initiatives, continued strong performance in Accredo, our industry leading specialty pharmacy, and organic growth of our services with deepening partnerships, all while continuing to invest for ongoing growth. Our adjusted pharmacy script volume was $393 million during the quarter, a 9% increase over first quarter 2020. Overall, Evernorth continued as positive momentum and delivered another strong quarter financial results. Turning to U.S. medical, we entered the year expecting to see the majority of COVID-19 testing and treatment cost pressure in the U.S. medical segment in the first half of 2021, particularly in the first quarter. As we progress throughout the first quarter we saw COVID-19 case counts and hospitalizations declined more rapidly than we originally anticipated. Additionally, as COVID-19 cases decelerated, we saw an increase in non-COVID utilization. Importantly, throughout all of this, we continue to see key components of preventive care, utilize the pre pandemic levels for U.S. commercial customer's taken as a whole and excluding prior year medical cost developments, our first quarter medical care ratio was in line with our expectations. With that as context, I'll now comment specifically on first quarter financial results for the U.S. medical segments. First quarter adjusted revenues were $10.4 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $987 million. Our first quarter U.S. medical earnings were slightly ahead of our expectations, primarily driven by favorable net investment income, and prior year medical cost development, partially offset by non recurring operating expenses. Excluding these onetime factors, our us medical earnings were in line with our expectations. Turning to membership we ended the quarter with 16.7 million total medical customers, an increase of 30,000 customers sequentially. As expected, U.S. commercial customer volume declined sequentially due to disenrollment throughout the first quarter, partially offset by new sales in the Select segment. And our U.S. government businesses performed well throughout the annual open enrollment periods. Overall results for Cigna's U.S. medical segment reflect strong fundamentals. In our international markets business, first quarter adjusted revenues were $1.6 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $262 million, reflecting business growth, favorable net investment income and foreign currency movements offset by higher claims costs during the period. I would also note that a refinements to the accounting for acquisition costs lead to a one-time favorable benefit in the first quarter of 2020 that did not recur in the current period. Corporate and other operations reflect a first quarter adjusted loss of $330 million. These results reflect lower interest expense due to lower levels of outstanding debt offset by the absence of contributions from the group disability and life business, which was invested on December 31, 2020. Overall, as a result of strong execution and a dynamic environment, we continue to deliver value for all of our stakeholders and strong financial results across our businesses. Now looking forward to our outlook for full year 2021. As we look to the balance of the year, we expect continued strong execution across our growth platforms. And we expect to make continued meaningful investments in our businesses that are responsive to the forces changing healthcare, positioning us for continued long term growth. Taken as a whole, we are raising our prior guidance for full year 2021. We now expect consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $166 billion, representing growth of approximately 7% after adjusting for the divestiture of our group disability and life business. We now expect full year 2021 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $7 billion or at least $20.20 per share. Within our outlook, we continue to expect a full year COVID-19 related headwind of approximately $1.25 per share, primarily within our U.S. medical business. And we continue to project an expense ratio in the range of 7.5% to 8%. I'll now discuss our 2021 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we now expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $5.65 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of at least 5%. This outlook reflects ongoing investments in our Evernorth portfolio, including investments in care solutions and MDLIVE as we continue to see significant opportunity to bring new innovative solutions to market. For U.S. medical, we continue to expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $3.8 billion. This outlook reflects focused execution in our businesses, as we expect to drive organic customer growth and deepening of customer relationships. We expect direct COVID-19 related testing and treatment to decline throughout the balance of the year, and also anticipate more normalized non-COVID utilization. And with the strength of the U.S. medical first quarter results, we will further accelerate strategic investments to support future growth, thus leaving our full year earnings outlook for U.S. medical unchanged. Regarding total medical customers, we now expect 2021 growth of at least 350,000 customers. This includes organic growth throughout the remainder of the year in our commercial business, led by the middle market and select segments partially offset by disenrollment in national accounts. We also expect Medicare Advantage customer growth in our target average annual growth range of 10% to 15%. And we expect continue growth in our individual business. Turning to medical costs, we continue to expect the 2021 medical care ratio to be in the range of 81% to 82%, reflecting the impacts in 2021 of elevated medical costs, including the impact of direct COVID-19 related costs, and more normalized non-COVID utilization, and the repeal of the health insurance tax effective for 2021. All while we continue to deliver strong clinical quality and overall affordability for our clients and customers. We also expect continued growth and strong margins in international markets. All-in for full year 2021, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of at least $7 billion, or at least $20.20 per share. Overall, these expected results reflect the differentiated value, strength and strategic positioning of our businesses as we deliver growth, while navigating the impacts associated with COVID-19. Now, moving to our 2021 capital management position and outlook, we expect our businesses to continue to drive exceptional cash flow with strong returns on capital, even as we continue reinvesting to support long term growth and innovation. For 2021, we continue to expect at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well performing businesses. During the quarter, we met our previously stated share repurchase expectations and year to date as of May 6, 2021, we have repurchased 14.4 million shares for $3.2 billion. And we now expect full year 2021 weighted average shares of 346 million to 348 million shares. We ended first quarter 2021 with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 39.9%, in line with our long term target of approximately 40%. We had $2.5 billion of cash available to parents at the end of the quarter. And on April 28, we declared a $1 per share dividend payable on June 23 to shareholders of record as of June 8. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins, and attractive returns on capital. So now to recap. Results in the first quarter reflect strong top line growth with contributions across our businesses. And first quarter earnings came in somewhat ahead of our expectations. These favorable first quarter earnings were primarily driven by strong Evernorth performance, favorable net investment income, and favorable prior year medical costs development, partially offset by non recurring operating expenses. Our strong results give us confidence in our increased outlook for full year 2021, all while continuing to support our customers, clients and co workers. As such, we now expect 2021 full year adjusted EPS of at least $20.20 per share, and have continued confidence in our long term growth targets. With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Finally, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question to allow sufficient time for questions from those remaining in the queue. One moment please for our first question. Our first question comes from Mr. Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead with your question, sir. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe it's just done on the PBM. The segment grew pre-tax income 13% year-over-year. And I think this is the quarter where you're actually lapping some benefits from COVID pull forward last year. So just wanted to see if there's anything you'd call out further within the PBM in the quarter? And then relatedly, if I look at the guidance from this point forward, it does seem to imply for the remaining three quarters kind of mid single digit growth, income growth within the PBM. So curious if you have line-of-sight into what might cause a deceleration from the strong performance in the first quarter? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Bob. It's Brian. So thanks for the question. And yes, we're really pleased with the strong start to the year in Evernorth, which as I mentioned in my comments, gives us the confidence to increase the full year guidance to at least $5.65 billion of operating income. Quarter-to-quarter there will be some level of variability in the segments. I would encourage you not to overreact to the singular quarter that we had here. But certainly pleased with 13% quarter-over-quarter earnings growth. I would remind you that our Prime Therapeutics partnership launched April 1, 2020. So the base period last year and the first quarter did not have contributions from Prime Therapeutics. So that was a bit of a benefit to this quarter that will not recur to the same degree for the balance of the year. So to your point on the operating income growth appearing to slow to some degree later in the year. That's one contribution that you should -- that they should keep in mind. Additionally, we continue to invest aggressively in Evernorth to expand and diversify the suite of solutions in that portfolio. So, as you think about Care Solutions, Benefits Management insights, we will make a continued organic and on a targeted basis in organic investments to continue to expand that portfolio, which will increase SG&A in to some degree temper the income growth for the balance of the year. David, anything you want to add to that? David Cordani : Just highlighting the fact that in support of that, for example, our Evernorth Benefits business performed very strongly in the first quarter. So on a year-over-year basis, that was a partial contributor to the year-over-year increase as Brian articulated. And we remain committed to continue to invest in the businesses, all while meeting now our increased earnings outlook for the full year. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Jones. Our next question comes from Mr. Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning. The SG&A on the U.S. Medical side that was higher. And I think you mentioned non-recurring operating expenses. So just hoping to give a little bit more details on what that exactly was and if you're willing to quantify the Evernorth? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Ralph. It's Brian. So maybe let me unpack the U.S. Medical non-recurring items a little bit. This might speak to the core of your question a little bit. As I mentioned in my comments, overall, our U.S. medical earnings in the quarter were above our expectations. But when you remove the effect of the three non-recurring items, we were in line with our expectations. So there's a three non recurring items that I cited, we had some favorability in the quarter and net investment income. We had some favorability in the quarter and prior year medical cost development, and that was offset by non-recurring operating expenses. And so, to the core of your question, the non-recurring operating expenses, you can think of as litigation-oriented matters associated with operations from several years ago. So these are not related to current time periods. These are unrelated to Anthem. These are matters from several years ago, but they're related to operations. And as a result of that, we chose to book them through SG&A as opposed to considering them as a special item below the line or anything like that. They were appropriate in our eyes to book through SG&A above the line. And in order of magnitude, you can think of that as approximately offsetting the favorable benefit that we had from net investment income in the quarter within U.S. medical. But those are truly non-recurring items since they're related to periods from several years ago and those matters should now be closed. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. I want to squeeze in a couple quick questions. First, in terms of medical cost expectations through the year, you give us an update on COVID, but wanted to get an idea of what you're thinking into the back half of the year in terms of -- in terms of utilization pick up, post the vaccine. What you built in versus kind of typical trend. And then, you mentioned, you divested -- plan to divest -- to sell that Texas Medicaid business. Just wanted to see if there's any background there in terms of what drove you to kind of the divest that? And then, kind of updated thoughts on your kind of Medicaid strategy going forward to be helpful? Thanks. David Cordani : Hey, Justin. Good morning. It's David. Let me just frame the medical costs for a moment and then ask Brian to talk a little bit more about our framework and our expectations for the year. And then I'll come back and address the Medicaid divestiture and our Medicaid direction more broadly. First, from a medical cost standpoint, big picture. We're pleased with the start to the year. Big picture broadly speaking, we're pleased to start to the year. And I just want to underscore a couple of components. One, our organization works tirelessly to try to drive elevated utilization of certain services like preventative care services. And importantly, we saw in the first quarter, the use of preventative care services like mammographies, colonoscopies, childhood immunizations, cervical cancer screenings to be at an approximate level of pre-pandemic levels. That's a tremendous result of offsetting what might have been a dampening to utilization. The national data we see more broadly is that utilization of those preventative care services is at a more dampened rate, but ours is an elevated or more consistent rate from that standpoint, which is quite important. Secondly, I would just remind you that and I'll tie this back in our Medicaid comment a little later, is that we have a de minimis amount of Medicaid within our portfolio. And our national data suggests to our services businesses, through Evernorth services business that in the first quarter Medicaid medical costs were a bit more dampened year-over-year in the first quarter of 2021. That's not an effect on our portfolio. But we can see that in the services that we're providing. And I'll ask Brian to give you a little bit more color forward looking on the year, then I'll come back and address Medicaid. Brian Evanko : Yes. Good morning, Justin. So, just a few other comments on the quarter and the balance of the year. Overall, as I mentioned in my comments, the U.S. Medical MCR was in line with our expectations for the first quarter, when you exclude the benefit of PYD [ph], or prior development. When you include the benefit of prior year development, we're actually a little bit favorable on the first quarter. And that was at an elevated level, as we expected, when we stepped into the year. For the balance of the year, we expect that deceleration in COVID-19, testing and treatment costs, we expect an uptick in non-COVID related utilization in quarters two through four, with those factors roughly offsetting one another. And so, when we constructed our full year outlook of an 81% to 82% medical care ratio, we stress tested a variety of scenarios about -- associate with those two levers and are quite confident in our ability to achieve the full year 81% to 82% medical care ratio for U.S. medical. David, maybe on the Texas Medicaid and our broader Medicaid strategy, over to you sure. David Cordani : Sure. Justin. We chose to divest of that single site Medicaid operation we had. So number one, it was -- we have one of one. So it was one off within our portfolio that has a de minimis impact on our P&L at the enterprise level. So putting that aside, we determined it was best for that business to be served by an expert or specialist. And we're pleased to effectuate and seek to close a successful transition to Molina. We think that's beneficial to the customers being served than our co-workers in that business. Looking forward, we continue to see Medicaid and government services first and foremost as an attractive growth opportunity within our Evernorth service portfolio. Whether it's Evernorth Pharmacy, Evernorth Care, Evernorth Benefits, Evernorth Intelligence, the opportunity to bring expanded services largely through health plans today in support of Medicaid will be a growing organic part of our portfolio. Over time, we see opportunities that will manifest themselves state-by-state on state specific service relationships against Evernorth. And then finally, as you recall from our Investor Day conversation, within our M&A priority, we continue to have an expansion of our U.S. government programs as an M&A priority. So we'll be opportunistic from that standpoint, if we see the ability to further strengthen any of our capabilities looking forward. But that divestiture was again, it was a one-off de minimis impact and we deemed that was best in the hands of a specialist. Thanks, Justin. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Mr. George Hill with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. George Hill : Yes. Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. I guess, David, I would ask a little bit more color about the MDLIVE acquisition? And how you guys are thinking about care delivery partnerships? And I'd love a little bit of commentary maybe on how the digital formulary is progressing. And if you could maybe talk about if that's going to have meaningful revenue contribution that's in the Evernorth segment? David Cordani : So thanks for the question, George. So specific to MDLIVE, first important to reference the fact that we had a multiyear relationship with MVLIVE both partnering to continue the services, but also through our very successful multiyear Cigna Ventures organization. So, we start from a learned shared experience and even deeper collaboration during the COVID environment. Specific to the asset and the direction, as we discussed in our Investor Day, we see rapid expansion of what we call alternative side of care to be one of the three major trends as we look forward over the next five to 10 years. This is an important part of those building blocks, and it's an important part of our Evernorth care portfolio of capabilities. We see it as much greater than telemed or even basic virtual care triaging. We see the ability to obviously expand virtual care, primary care, behavioral care. We see the ability to expand that further in terms of longitudinal chronic care programs, polychronic, and ultimately complex care programs and capabilities. So it provides us an accelerant to our strategic direction with a known partner that will now be part of the overall Cigna portfolio. And we're excited. Because net-net, it drives, improved service, improved access, improved affordability with strong clinical outcomes for the benefit of our consumers. So truly an aggregate win-win in the portfolio. Specific to the digital formulary that innovation continues to be somewhat unique in the marketplace. Our clients really appreciate the approach relative to the digital formulary, helping to essentially curate and apply externally validated expertise to the vast array of digital alternatives that exists in the ecosystem to help, to provide employers more informed decisions for those that may have the greatest outcome and impact for the benefit of the customer. So, I view that as a part of our consultative approach in terms of providing support, and a part of our approach to -- in this case partner and curate additional services on a go forward basis. Taking in the whole, we see, again, our Evernorth care capabilities as an exciting part of the broader economic growth capabilities, and we see the ability to do that in a complimentary nature with our proven value based care relationships within our Cigna, our portfolio as well. Hope that helps, George. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Hill. Our next question comes from a Mr. A.J. Rice. Your line is open sir, with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. I'm going to just ask about the selling season, both for Medical and for Evernorth on the PBM side. I know last year, there was some discussion about potentially people being delayed, different people had different views as to how much of that activity actually happened. I wondered what you've seen in terms of RFP activity on both sides of the business, anything to discuss in terms of new and innovative ways that Cigna is going to market in those two sides of your business? And any discussion about early wins, losses? David Cordani : A.J. Good morning, it's David. So relative to the selling season, looking to 2022, your question goes at the commercial side, as well as the services side of the business. First, on the commercial side of the portfolio, at this stage of the year, we're typically looking at the national accounts environment. And remind you that we define national accounts in -- for our U.S. commercial portfolio a little bit more narrowly than some in the market. So it's commercial employers, 5,000 or more employees who are multi-state in nature. As we look to 2022, right now, we see an environment where the RFP volume, so the opportunity to pursue new business is up somewhat. I think order of magnitude 10%. And we see the portion of our book of business that's out to bid is being up marginally less than that 10% number. So that's a little bit of framing. We have some early traction, some early wins, that exists in our portfolio. And as we sit here at this stage of the environment, we're optimistic that we'll have a very good commercial outlook in aggregate for our portfolio as we look to 2020. I'll bridge with a trend comment and then I'll come to the Evernorthportfolio. Clearly affordability remains a top decision criteria for commercial employers,. There's no doubt about that. We spent ample time on that at our Investor Day, and it remains a top strategic imperative. Further, beyond that is the flexibility necessary, and then the innovation required to truly integrate or coordinate mental and physical health programs, and then expand and coordinate access to care in a less fragmented way through alternative site of care framework, et cetera. So we see the trends being well lined up to our direction. As relates to within Evernorth and specific to your question within pharmacy services. As you recall, we have now multiple years of very attractive growth under our belts as a combined organization. And we're pleased with that. As we look to 2022, we have an environment where to date our employer renewal process is manifesting itself quite strongly. And our health plan renewal process is manifesting itself rather strongly beyond the two known losses that we previously discussed, relative to the health plan business. Taken as a whole, we'd expect the retention in that business as we sit here right now to be a bit less than our recent couple of years, which have been historic highs in the upper 90s, we'll expect it to be more in the mid 90s as a consistent rate. And then taken as a whole, we will expect to see both revenue and earnings growth in our Evernorth portfolio in 2022. So, both pointing in a positive direction would be the summary I would leave you with. A.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, great. Thanks. The way that you were framing the drop-off and COVID utilization, and then I guess the earlier return in volumes. To me implied that the COVID impact might actually end up being less than what you were forecasting. But you obviously reaffirm that number. So just any thoughts about kind of the puts and takes of COVID is dropping faster than you thought? Can then, do you still feel like about half of that coming back next year is the right way to think about that? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Kevin. It's Brian. So, a few thoughts on your question. I appreciate the framing of it. Broadly in the quarter, as I said earlier, the MCR for U.S. Medical was in line with our expectations when you include the federal benefit from prior year development. Now the components within were a little bit different than we anticipated. So to your point, the COVID-19 testing and treatment burden on our book was a little bit lower than we anticipated for the quarter. However, non COVID utilization was a little bit higher than we anticipated coming into the quarter. So net effect of those two factors led to the U.S. Medical MCR, being back in line with where we expected it to be. As we trend out the balance of the year, we continue to expect that phenomenon to perceive, meaning, deceleration in COVID-19 testing and treatment costs, and a little bit of an uptick in non COVID related utilization. So to your point, we expect about 50% of the EPS headwind associated with COVID-19, a $1.25 to continue to show up in the U.S. Medical MCR. And bridging over into 2022, we continue to anticipate about half of that $1.25, or a little bit over half of that to return in the form of earnings in our 2022 enterprise portfolio. And as such, we would expect that our long term annual growth rate in EPS of 10% to 13%. We would expect to achieve results that's at or above the high end of that range relative to our updated guidance of at least $20.20 per share. Kevin Fischbeck : Helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Miss. Lisa Gil with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Lisa Gil : Thanks very much for taking my question. I just wanted to go back, David, and ask a question around the comments that you made around MDLIVE. Specifically, you talked about expanding primary care and longitudinal care. You talked earlier about your relationship with Ginger around mental health. So, my question here is really twofold. First, where do you see the opportunities with MDLIVE around lowering overall medical costs for Cigna? Second, do you believe that you need to buy or continue to build out something around behavioral health? And then thirdly, can you just give us an idea of how many Cigna Lives actually use MDLIVE today? David Cordani : Lisa, thanks. Appreciate the ongoing interest in the space for sure. So number one, bigger picture framing, I appreciate that you brought MDLIVE, Ginger together, for example. We don't -- we do not believe that this is a one-and-done type activity. So, we don't believe that a corporation secures itself a virtual care asset. And then this were for the alternative delivery space. This is a fluid environment. It's a dynamic environment, and it\u2019s an environment that has massive promise relative to bringing the expanded access, coordination of services, and improve overall value coming back to the affordability. Our organic capabilities are strong, the MDLIVE asset advances that massively. But as Brian noted in his prior comments, as well, we continue to invest in the space. So I want you to view that we view it as a dynamic and fluid space and we very much like our positioning. Two is, just like in the -- what we'll call it the traditional care delivery space, the coordination of physical and mental health is mission critical. Just because it's in a virtual care environment, doesn't mean that the coordination of the leverage opportunity there is not -- is critical. And in fact, the virtual capabilities allow us to take fragmentation out of the system more aggressively and more comprehensively. To your affordability comment, unequivocally, we see an ability to further improve affordability through alternative site of care and through our virtual capabilities. You may recall from Investor Day, we identified alternative site of care or site of care leverage as a meaningful opportunity to further deflect or improve overall affordability. And an example maybe, we see already in a virtual care delivery, less use of unnecessary or redundant diagnostic services. That's a tangible illustration of a improvement in affordability. Conversely, we see opportunities to even further close gaps in care or increase utilization of the right services, like maintenance medications, through the dynamic, more intimate, ongoing interaction with customers or patients from that standpoint. So my points are threefold. One, continuation of investment here and innovation off of a very strong base. Two, a continued need to use the capabilities to close fragmentation within the system or get more complimentary leverage, most notably between the medical health and the mental health capabilities. And three, unequivocally a contributor to further improved affordability. Lisa Gil : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Miss. Gill. Our next question comes from Mr. Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question. Joshua Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Here with Eric Percher as well. Can you speak to the progress in both the individual exchanges? I think I heard 17% number as well as the small group markets. I'm specifically interested in membership growth. And when you think you have enough information around medical costs and sort of utilization of new product, et cetera to better understand sort of profit trajectories here, this year? David Cordani : Hey, Josh, good morning. It's David. Let me just start and frame the growth trajectory. And then ask Brian to will provide a little bit of additional color, relative to our insights on the performance. First, we're very pleased. We're very pleased with the sustained performance starting with the individual exchanges. Just as you recall, we entered the exchanges in the first year, and we've sustained engagement in the exchanges since its inception. We've innovated within the exchanges. We've delivered a proven model. And now we're in an expansion mode relative to additional geographies, in large part with our collaborative accountable care and aligned value based relationships from the healthcare delivery system. And we're pleased with the results, both the base results in individual exchange, as well as thus far our early look at the additional enrollment we're seeing because the expanded SEP. I'll ask Brian just give you a little color relative to that dimension. As relates to the small employer marketplace. As you know, we, Cigna historically have not played in the small employer marketplace. What we've focused above 51 lives or above 100 lives depending on the regulation more broadly. We have continued to view it as an underserved market, a market that has had more traditional or rigidly designed programs, less innovation and less flexibility, and less leverage of more modern specialty and clinical services. And our determination was, it was best to pursue that market in partnership, leveraging our partnership DNA. And we've entered that market successfully with our partnership with Oscar. We're really early in that journey, some positive indicators for sure, we're really in the journey. Our early indicators are positive, though, that has us accelerating our geographies. And in collaboration with Oscar, and again back to in partnership with our healthcare delivery partners. So, Brian, maybe just a little color in terms of what we view the SEP process looking like and the economics within the individual exchange? Brian Evanko : Sure. Good morning, Josh. Our individual membership year to-date is a little bit above our expectations for a couple of different reasons. One is, I'm sure you know, we stepped into 80 new counties in 2021. And the enrollment, the annual enrollment period there was a little bit above our expectations. Additionally, the expanded special enrollment period window that President Biden introduced has generated some new lives in our portfolio as of the end of the first quarter. We have no reason to believe at this juncture that those customers will perform meaningfully differently than the balance of our individual exchange portfolio to your point on when will we know for sure. It will take several months, as we understand the risk adjuster profile, and the persistency of those new lives, et cetera. But I also would remind you the individual exchange membership only represents about 5%, 6% of our total U.S. Medical portfolio. So it won't be a significant needle mover relative to the MCR for your outlook for U.S. Medical. Joshua Raskin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Mr. Scott Fidel with Stephens. You may ask your question. Scott Fidel : Hi. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Question just first, if it be helpful, maybe you could break down just on the $1 billion raise revenue guidance. How you would sort of break that down between each of the three segments? And then also, interested just in sort of what you're seeing in aggregate right now around the debate around inflation, and not just think about medical inflation, but obviously, Cigna has a lot of insights into just general inflation dynamics across all of your businesses. So, interested in terms of what you're seeing in the first quarter as relates to whether you're actually seeing inflation rising and, and how you're thinking about the outlook for that over the course of the year? Thanks. David Cordani : Scott, good morning. It's David. I'm going to ask Brian, just to give you a little color on our really strong sustained revenue performance. And then I'll come back and seek to address your inflation question. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Scott. So really pleased with the Q1 performance on revenue as well as the full year increase in our guidance of at least $166 billion. You should think of the majority of that increase coming from the Evernorth segment. But importantly, we're also seeing strength within U.S. Medical. So we think of most of it from Evernorth and a bit of an uptick in U.S. Medical as well. David, back to you on the inflation question. David Cordani : Sure. Scott, on the inflation question, I'm going to come out with two ways. First, through the core visibility of our business and then more broadly for those we serve. Thus far within our business, we do not see a large trajectory change relative to what I would call cost of goods sold inflationary pressure. There's always some, makes no doubt about it. There is always some. But through ongoing innovation, ongoing productivity, ongoing value based collaboration, broadly speaking, I would not call a large sea [ph] change from that standpoint. Beyond that, in the broader economy, whether we look at it through a U.S. lens or pockets of markets outside the United States, there's clearly a warming up. There's an indisputable warming up of the economy. And there's a clearly warming up of inflationary indicators, but none of which have triggered across a threshold to suggest any one industry safe for some unique outliers, any kind of orange going to red threshold levels of inflation, but the robustness of the economy and some of the underlying cost drivers in some sub sectors are slowly beginning to elevate. And I think have a lot of industry leaders watching to ensure that any movement in curves, any movement in cost curves could be anticipated, either eradicated through pricing actions, like CPG companies that are being intensively discussed, cost pressures in some sub sectors of the technology ecosystem where the chip industry is out of pattern relative to supply and demand from that standpoint. But broadly speaking, I would say again, nothing affecting our space over the immediate term horizon from an inflationary standpoint. Scott Fidel : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fidel. Our next question comes from Mr. Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Matthew Borsch : Thank you. Let me ask the question about Medicare Advantage in the outlook. How do you think it's going to work with rates? I know that I'm asking about 2023. And I know that's a light year away. But my question really is Medicare Advantage benefited from the lower expenses in 2020? I'm wondering how you think that's going to roll through the rate calculation. Because right now, CMS has 2020, down 8% per capita, and then increasing about 11% in this year and the next year. And so I guess my question is, do you think that kind of trajectory is likely for medical costs? And then, if you can comment on how you think that might work into the 2023 rate? David Cordani : Matthew, a pretty complex, Rubik's cube would put on the table. Thoughtful, but nonetheless complex. I think a you -- as I think your question and [Indiscernible] question. If we look at the 2020 to 2021 environment, clearly, the posture of CMS recognize the COVID dislocation, recognize that dislocation, for examples, implication on risk adjusters sought to in their own methodology, seek to provide some offset to that relative to their rate setting environment, as well as their guidance relative to delivery system reimbursement, and set themselves up for what I would say is a pretty fluid and complex environment over the ensuing couple of years ahead. So, I would expect the next couple years cycle to be a little non-traditional from that standpoint, given the need to adjust the various moving parts that result in a net rate setting environment. History would tell us that the result of all of the above, plus or minus a point or two largely gets the program to a balanced sustainable outcome. And looking forward, I would expect that because the Medicare Advantage program continues to deliver outstanding value, as you know, for seniors, hence the tremendous support from a senior standpoint, as well as overall clinical quality and affordability of which through the bonus programs and the reimbursement programs the federal government's budget actually benefits from. So I would expect it to be able to be balanced for that, but a little bit more lumpy than it has been in the past. And I think this year's risk adjuster through ups will be really mission critical in terms of how CMS sees the industry, recapturing a little bit more of the information that they deem necessary to get the risk adjusters and then they'll factor that into the forward looking 2023 rate environment. Stay tuned for more. Matthew Borsch : Okay, David. Thank you. Operator : Thank you Mr. Borsch. Our next question comes from Miss. Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. One for David. You talked about sort of the return of some of the diagnostic procedures did now are in line with for pandemic. Are you clearly, acuity is a big uncertainty for the rest of the year? But now that you starting to have this data as individuals are starting to come back for preventive care testing. Are you seeing any changes in acuity? That's one. And then my second question goes back to M&A and investments, clearly, a very big focus and part of your growth strategy. So what metric do you use when you evaluate a buy versus a partner or a build decision? David Cordani : Ricky, good morning, It's David. We're going to take both of your questions. And your first question. To be very clear, we have seen consistent, strong utilization of preventative care services. And notably, what I called out is, for example, in the first quarter of 2021, broadly speaking, preventative care services inclusive of mammographies, colonoscopies, childhood immunizations, cervical cancer screening, plus or minus in the commercial portfolio business, approximate pre pandemic levels. We think that's a very good thing. I mean, underscore. It's a very good thing and something that our team has worked tirelessly to try to effectuate elevating those levels. We see that performance against a national dataset that suggests the utilization of those preventative care services are down versus pre pandemic levels 10% to 15% for our book of business they are not. As a predictor then to the future, we see that as a mitigant for an elevation of acuity, all other things remaining equal, because you're consistently identifying an earlier stage through the preventative diagnostics or the preventative services. Equally as important, as I noted in my prepared remarks, are, for example, within our Evernorth portfolio and within our Evernorth Pharmacy portfolio, for those customers being served by our mail order, we've actually seen get even further elevation of medication adherence. That's really important for the chronic population to avoid spikes in acuity moving forward, whether it's for a diabetic, COPD, asthmatic or other patients from that standpoint. So, broadly speaking, we're working tirelessly to get the right clinical quality and services to be consumed and supported with the clinical resources we have to avert spikes and acuity going forward. And therefore we don't expect a large spike in acuity on a look forward basis, given the strong preventative or medication compliance. As it relates to your M&A question, there's not a simple way to answer your question, importantly, though, to frame. We look at all either growth or expansion of capability opportunities through buy-build-ally frameworks. We relentlessly go through a buy-build-ally framework. So for example, today within our Evernorth benefit portfolio, we're organically building out additional post acute care capabilities after evaluating buying, further partnering or insourcing those capabilities. We typically will look at that three, right-to-win, a strategic positioning and an economic framework. So you'll look at it through a variety of frameworks. It's not a simple economic hurdle rate. Your question didn't infer that it was a single measure, but it's not a single economic hurdle rate. It's through a right-to-win size and trajectory of the market, the resources with which to pursue whether it's organic build collaboration through a partnership, or from an acquisitive standpoint. And obviously, certain economic hurdle rates come into play, which we don't discuss probably, those are proprietary, but you would imagine we're quite disciplined in terms of our return to capital thresholds. Ricky, hope that helps? Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Miss Goldwasser. Our next question comes from Mr. Steve Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Steve Valiquette : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So there was a question earlier on inflation. I actually have a question on deflation. Just want to check the box and get your quick thoughts on generic pricing as there's been some mixed signals and the level of generic deflation in the first quarter. I guess I was curious, was there any evidence of accelerated deflation that may have played a role in better cost of goods sold in your mail water operations within Evernorth? And also you mentioned the effective supply chain initiative again this quarter. Just curious what that means for 2021 in particular, whether is that just code for better drug purchasing and procurement this year? Are there other factors within the \"supply chain initiative\" driving better results? Thanks. David Cordani : Good morning, it's David. So two-point questions. First, there's no doubt there are some pockets of generic deflation within the within the pricing environment which is the cost environment. Importantly, they're in line with our expectations. So it's not a deviant or driver of deviation for us in any way shape or form in terms of our broad portfolio. But unequivocally there are some pockets of deflation there in line with our expectations. As relates to the supply chain activity, I would ask you just to continue to think about supply chain initiatives as being an inherent strength within the overall portfolio through a variety of lenses, whether it's collaboration on the medical side of the equation, the traditional supply chain activity, the value-based supply chain activity, et cetera. And we have a continuous drive to improve value, albeit, to partner as we go through the process and as we get into some more of the complex dimensions of the higher costs, drugs and medications, we think there's further opportunity through the supply chain activity around value based care relationships, aligned incentive relationships more specifically with the manufacturers and with ourselves on a go forward basis. So I wouldn't call out any unique driver. More importantly, it's a continuous improvement part of our portfolio, and it's an underlying strength of our portfolio. And lastly, our sustained growth supports that in a very positive way. Steve Valiquette : Got it? Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our last question comes from Mr. David Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question. David Windley : Hi, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to come back to the telemedicine topic and David thinking about your capital light strategy relative to providers and network. I'm wondering if Evernorth and Cigna has an opportunity to leverage MDLIVE into your collaborative care partnerships or otherwise into partnered networks as opposed to own networks in your case? And then alternatively, do you have an opportunity to use MDLIVE to feed volume or refer volume, catch volume if you so to speak in parts of -- other parts of Evernorth, especially pharmacy mail or delivery, things like that by owning and controlling telemedicine through MDLIVE? David Cordani : Good morning. Appreciate the question. So twofold. The first part of your question, the simple answer is yes. So to be really clear. Again, we see the opportunity, obviously, from a standalone, if you will fulfillment and delivery of the service but also an opportunity in collaboration in alignment as a panel extender for high performing collaborative accountable care relationships. And those conversations are dynamic and underway. To the second part of your question, very thoughtful framework and appreciate it. If we come back and think about first and foremost, our ability to further improve affordability. You may recall at our Investor Day, we talked about four major ways in which we further improve affordability off of our strong overall cost environment today. One, is to further increase the percentage of utilization that takes place in the highest performing clinical settings, be they physicians or facilities. Second, is to work to reduce the cost of drugs further. Third, is to effectively leverage alternative sites of care. For example, the difference between a knee replacement that is inpatient versus outpatient is about a third less than cost. And we see a massive shift at the physical side of care is similar in virtual side of care. And then fourth, the ability to further coordinate the fragmented system specifically in the areas of medical and behavioral. So back to your question. Our evolution of our telemedicine and virtual care capability present opportunities to contribute to a variety of these areas to help to support individual customers or patients accessing higher cost healthcare specialists or delivery system partners, helping to drive further leverage relative to the pharmaceutical equation in terms of medication compliance, or alternative lower cost medications, and the ability to merge or coordinate services be the behavioral and pharmacy behavioral and medical are being in that quarterback position with a customer patient from that standpoint. So we see it as being complimentary to a variety of those initiatives. And we see it being both complimentary to your first question, proprietary driving on our own, and in collaboration is a panel extended for high performing healthcare professional partners. Thanks for the question. David Windley : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you Mr. Windley. I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : First, thanks for our time today. We really appreciate spending time to discuss our Cigna results and our outlook. I just want to wrap up our call with a few headlines. First and foremost, we delivered strong financial performance during the quarter as we continue to navigate through what is undoubtedly a dynamic environment. And we work to meet and balance the needs of all of our stakeholders, as we act as champions for healthcare that is affordable, predictable and simple. In addition, our strong foundation driven by our growth framework and track record of success gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our increased EPS outlook for 2021 of $20.20. As well as positions as well for our ongoing long term average annual revenue growth rate of 68% and our 10% to 13% average annual adjusted EPS growth rate, all while continuing to pay attractive dividend. With that again, we thank you for joining our call and we look forward to our future conversations. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's first quarter 2021 results review.

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter the queue to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Ms. Alexis Jones. Please go ahead, Ms. Jones. Alexis Jones : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Alexis Jones, Lead Principal for Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's second quarter 2021 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2021. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations, and adjusted revenues which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders' net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2021 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the second quarter, we recorded an after tax special item benefit of $9 million or $0.03 per share related to debt extinguishment costs incurred during the period. We also recorded an after tax special item charge of $14 million or $0.04 per share for integration and transaction related costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues and our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2021 outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2021 dividend, and excludes the impact of any business combinations or divestitures that may occur after today. With that, I will turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks, Alexis and thank you for everyone for joining us on today's call. So I'm going to spend a few minutes talking about the current environment and the forces that are shaping it, the strength in durable nature of our model that enables us to capitalize on opportunities and continue to grow even in the most disruptive conditions and how the strength and durability is fueling our short and long-term success. Then Brian will share more details about our second quarter results, as well as our outlook for the rest of the year. And we'll take your questions. So, let's jump in. During the quarter, we delivered adjusted revenue of $43 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.24 per share, all what we could do to drive balanced capital deployment as we execute on M&A, share repurchase and our quarterly dividend plan. We achieved these results in a fluid and challenging environment. As we continue to execute our strategy, we are confident in our ability to navigate these dynamic conditions. Our portfolio with three growth platforms enables us to create value for our clients and customers and drive sustained business growth. During the quarter, the strength of our Evernorth business was clearly a standout. We are seeing high demand for health services programs, and we continue to invest in broadening our service offerings, as well as our reach. Our sustained success validates our ability to be a trusted partner of choice for customers and clients, as they manage many of the most challenging aspects of healthcare today. We do this by leveraging our portfolio. That includes pharmacy solutions, benefit management solutions, care solutions, and intelligence solutions. Evernorth is helping to improve access to care, keep costs down and deliver better outcomes, as we serve our clients, patients, and customers. And another quarter of Evernorth strong revenue and earnings growth reinforces that our customers and clients value these capabilities. In Cigna Medical, we did see elevated medical cost pressure in the quarter, as costs associated with direct COVID-19 care and the broader ramp-up of utilization levels exceeded our projections. Within this challenging environment, we continue to take proactive steps to ensure our customers have access to the care they need. This includes the elevated mental health services needed during these unprecedented times, as well as continued to work with our customers and patients to help navigate them to optimal sites of care. During the quarter, we achieved customer growth in Cigna Medical, in both our U.S. Commercial and Government business. And we continue to be on track for medical customer growth of at least 350,000 customers in 2021. Brian will share additional perspective on our results and outlook and his comments. Overall, our performance, which is strong through the first half of the year, reflects the resiliency of our business and the balanced profile within our organization. With our focus on driving performance during the remainder of the year, it's imperative that we understand and account for the challenges our customers and clients will face, as well as the continued evolution of the healthcare landscape. At a macro level, the environment is marked by ongoing uncertainty for business, governments, communities around the world. For example, COVID vaccination levels have brought welcome relief to millions, given only about half of the U.S. is fully vaccinated, and that percentage is much lower for the world's population. With the spread of the more contagious Delta variant, COVID infections and hospitalizations are on the rise in some regions, bringing renewed attention to travel restrictions and mask mandates. We see the economic recovery, while positive, has let uneven and varied amongst industries, as companies continue to cope with supply chain disruption, emerging inflationary pressure and various issues impacting the workforce. More broadly from a health perspective, federal and state policy makers continue to be actively engaged. And as we've previously discussed, we continue to see three primary forces of change shaping the healthcare landscape today and into the future. Specifically, pharmacological innovation, including specialty pharmaceuticals, gene therapies, evolved oncology medications, vaccines and acceleration in biosimilars. Second, the recognition of the link between mental health and physical health continues to grow, especially accelerated in this COVID environment. And third, the rise of virtual care and other alternative access to care models are rapidly changing. Together, these macro dynamics are profoundly influencing buying behaviors and service innovation in healthcare. Now, with respect to clients, we are seeing a renewed commitment of employer clients to providing healthcare benefits vital to helping them to both attract and retain talent, as well as increased productivity by maintaining a healthy workforce. This includes, for example, adopting alternative side of care programs and access programs. We see an intensified need for affordability across all of our clients, including pharmacy services, as demand surges for high price, breakthrough drug therapies. We see a desire for more concentrated solution based services, as many clients are confronting the convergence of social, physical, and mental health issues in ways they have not experienced before. With respect to the individual customers and patients utilizing our service, we see that they're increasingly valuing their employee-based service models. They're benefiting from support services that help them tend to their emotional wellbeing. And they have growing demand for coordination of care, both in COVID and non-COVID events. Against this backdrop, we are delivering differentiated value for the benefit of our customers and clients with our capabilities that address their emerging and evolving needs. For example, we have had a strong focus on providing virtual services, broadening networks, as well as coordinated clinical programs. In our pharmacy solutions, we've been answering the call for greater affordability, as we continue to see the emergence of new and expensive pharmacological advancements. Evernorth's recent expansion of our industry first comprehensive weight management program illustrates the benefit of a more coordinated approach. Patients can now receive treatment with Wegovy, a promising new therapy for obesity and other weight management medications. And now with MDLIVE fully operational within our Evernorth business, MDLIVE physicians along with other Evernorth clinicians are available to help patients. This program expansion also includes personalized support services from health coaches, peer support groups, and curated digital apps. This weight management effort is the latest addition to our Evernote suite of SafeguardRX programs. As we're impacting 2020, patients enrolled in SafeguardRX to save more than $6 billion in aggregate. In Evernorth care solutions, we've experienced an increase in demand for our behavioral health solutions from customers and clients as well. In the past year and a half, it has brought heightened stress and other personal challenges, and we see many more people reaching out for help and services. Clients now more broadly understand that someone with a chronic condition is more likely to have a mental health or substance abuse related illness and individuals are feeling the additional mental and physical challenges associated with the pandemic. With our market leading behavioral health capabilities, we are driving more value to our Evernorth and Cigna medical clients and customers by providing the tools and services they need to address their mental wellbeing and deliver better, sustained long-term outcomes. Within our Cigna medical platform in U.S. Commercial, we are working closely with our employer clients to provide our integrated suite of solutions, designed to make their workforce healthier and more productive. We know that employees receiving health and wellbeing benefits through their employers are less likely to miss work because of poor health. Our recent study shows a significant impact of the 70 fewer percent days missed over a year. With our integrated approach, we strive to bring the right mix of solutions that reduce the workforce challenges many of our clients are facing and helping to support them to engage and retain their employees. And affordability is remained the primary focus across our entire portfolio, as it is in Cigna medical. Our clients continue to manage through an incredibly dynamic environment for their business and is becoming even more important that they can count on us with greater affordability for the healthcare programs. New and expensive pharmacological advancements are predominant contributor to this challenge. And we have been a leader here putting these treatments in the hands of those who need them at a more affordable price. For example, Remicade is treatment for chronic conditions, such as Crohn's disease or rheumatoid arthritis, while life changing can also impose significant financial burdens. One year of Remicade infusion costs about $30,000 on average, and as much as $70,000, depending on site of care. We recently launched a Cigna pharmacy program that shares prescription drug savings directly with patients who switched from Remicade to one of the approved biosimilars. More than 20% of eligible patients in consultation with their provider have already switched to lower cost preferred alternative medications. This program has an immediate benefit to clients who save at least 10% of the cost of the drug. And we've taken a leadership position here by supporting our patients with a $500 incentive. This is a great example of aligning interest. Over the longer term, we can drive even greater impact as biosimilars become a more prevalent part in the United States as helping us further improve affordability And in Cigna medical, we're actively working toward improving affordability by ensuring that our customers continue to have the access to the care they need and optimize their long-term health. For example, in Arizona, we conducted a highly targeted outreach program to our customers who are high risk due to chronic condition, yet who have not been vaccinated. The initial results are encouraging, and we're seeing positive increase in vaccination rates amongst these targeted individuals. We are now taking the learnings from that pilot into other locations across the United States, with a particular focus on increasing vaccination rates amongst those in most need. This broad range of examples illustrates how our comprehensive and strategic approach to helping our clients and customers address their most pressing health needs help us going forward. And in this dynamic environment, we will continue to expand the services we offer our clients and customers, and therefore, we see many more opportunities to create value for both our clients and customers, and as a result for your shareholders. It is clear that the strength of our medical and pharmacy offerings combined with our strategic agility has enabled us to continue to capture growth, even in the most dynamic environment by delivering differentiated value, by partnering and relentlessly innovating, and by expanding our addressable markets, as we broaden our reach to new geographies and through the introduction of a broader suite of solutions. When you combine this compelling growth potential, along with our significant operating cash flow generated by our service-based capital light model, we have confidence in our ability to meet our long-term targets by achieving differentiated results, which include average annual revenue growth of 6% to 8%, average annual EPS growth of 10% to 13% and continued to pay an attractive dividends, all while producing cumulative operating cash flow of approximately $50 billion through 2025. Relative to 2021, we remain committed to delivering full year EPS of at least $20.20. Now to briefly summarize. First, we recognize in an environment like this it's so challenging, we know that growth doesn't come easily. It has to be earned each and every day. Second, we have a proven track record of delivering differentiated value, innovating and partnering and smartly expanding our addressable market to fuel sustained long-term growth, even in disrupted environment. And our company has attractive sustainable growth opportunities across our three well position growth platforms, and importantly the strategic and capital flexibility to take advantage of opportunities. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Evanko : Thanks David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna second quarter results, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business. And I'll discuss our updated outlook for the full year. Key consolidated financial highlights for second quarter of 2021 include adjusted revenue growth of 10% to $43.1 billion; adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion after tax; and adjusted earnings per share of $5.24. Results in the second quarter reflects strong top line growth with solid contributions across our businesses. Before I go into segment specific results, I'd like to spend a couple of minutes addressing the medical cost environment we are experiencing. Let me be clear. Our second quarter results and our full year outlook have been adversely impacted by elevated claim costs compared to our prior expectations. Despite this pressure, our diversified portfolio of businesses and multiple earnings levers drove second quarter adjusted earnings that exceeded our expectations at the enterprise level. Specifically within the second quarter, ongoing direct COVID-19 costs were above our expectations and non-COVID utilization returned more rapidly than we anticipated. During my comments today and in our Q&A, David and I will use the term baseline to refer to 2019 or pre-pandemic claim costs that will be trended forward for two years to 2021, to provide you with an estimate for what 2021 claim costs would have been in the absence of COVID-19. The return of non-COVID utilization has varied by both geography and customer group. For example, we saw the following within the second quarter : In U.S. Commercial, non-COVID costs were back to baseline level; while in Medicare Advantage, non-COVID costs accelerated from first quarter levels, but remain slightly below baseline for the second quarter. We expect to continue seeing elevated claim costs compared to our original expectations for the balance of 2021 within U.S. Medical. However, the strength of our diversified portfolio of businesses and our multiple earnings levers, give us the confidence to reaffirm our full year EPS outlook of at least $20.20. Additionally, as we look forward to 2022, while we recognize the dynamic environment in which we operate, we expect another year of attractive growth driven by all three of our growth platforms. Now, I'd like to turn to our segment level results and then provide an update on the details of our outlook, as well as our capital positioning. Regarding our segments. I'll first comment on Evernorth. Second quarter 2021 adjusted revenues grew 14% to $32.6 billion, and adjusted pre-tax earnings grew 13% to $1.4 billion compared to the second quarter of 2020. Evernorth's strong results in the quarter were driven by ongoing organic growth, driving both top and bottom line contributions and continued progress on a range of affordability initiatives for the benefit for our customers and clients. In the quarter, we also continued to make significant investments to support our ongoing growth, including our virtual care platform and technology capabilities. Our adjusted pharmacy script volume was $410 million during the quarter, a 13% increase over second quarter 2020, driven by strong organic growth, as well as the impact of vaccine volumes in the quarter. Overall, Evernorth delivered another strong quarter, continuing to create differentiated value for clients and customers, while driving better-than-expected top and bottom line contribution to the enterprise. Turning to U.S. Medical. Second quarter adjusted revenues were $10.5 billion and adjusted pretext earnings were $1 billion. Overall, our second quarter U.S. Medical earnings reflected the impact of elevated claim costs, offset by favorability from operating expenses, non-recurring items and net investment income. Regarding our medical costs. We entered the second quarter expecting a continued decline in COVID-related claim costs and a gradual return in broader care consumption patterns toward more normalized levels. While these directional patterns did transpire, as I noted earlier, both direct COVID-19 costs and broader utilization levels were above our expectations for the second quarter. Direct COVID-19 costs were highest in April, decreasing throughout the second quarter, while non-COVID costs approximated baseline levels for the quarter. Both U.S. Commercial and U.S. Government total medical costs reflecting the combined impact of direct COVID-19 and non-COVID costs were above baseline for the quarter, with U.S. Commercial further above baseline as those customers returned to utilize the healthcare system at a slightly higher level. Given these developments, the second quarter medical care ratio was above our expectation. We now expect that the level of non-COVID costs we incurred toward the end of the second quarter will persist for the balance of the year. This coupled with the ongoing direct COVID-19 related costs we expect to incur has led us to raise our guidance for the full year 2021 medical care ratio. Turning to membership. We ended the quarter with 17 million total medical customers, an increase of 249,000 customers sequentially. The customer growth in the quarter was largely driven by new wins in middle market and growth in the individual business through the extended special enrollment periods, supported by continued strong retention across our portfolio. All-in. for U.S. Medical, we continue driving customer growth and expanding services, while remaining focused on delivering value and supporting our customers and clients in the dynamic environment. In our International markets business, second quarter adjusted revenues were $1.6 billion and adjusted pre-tax earnings were $234 million. These results were approximately in line with our expectations. Corporate and other operations delivered a second quarter adjusted loss of $331 million. Overall, we continue to deliver value for all of our stakeholders with strong growth, reflecting contributions across our businesses, led by outperformance in Evernote, the diversified portfolio of Cigna businesses and the multiple avenues to create an ultimately capture value has allowed us to continue meeting our enterprise commitments despite ongoing uncertainties in the marketplace. Now turning to our updated outlook for full year 2021. We are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share guidance for full year 2021 of at least $20.20. Before I walked through the outlook by segment, I'd like to frame the key drivers underlying this outlook. The updated components include an increase in expected earnings from Evernorth, a decrease in expected earnings from U.S. Medical driven by a higher medical care ratio, a more favorable outlook for operating expenses, and other contributions that are net favorable for the year. Additionally, we now expect full year 2021 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $170 billion, representing growth of at least 9% from 2020, when excluding the divestiture of our group disability and life business. Within our outlook, we now expect a full year COVID-19 related headwind of approximately $2.50 per share, primarily impacting our U.S. Medical business. This includes approximately 80% related to impacts on the medical care ratio and approximately 20% related to lower customer volumes due to economy driven enrollment dynamics. Finally, we now expect an adjusted SG&A ratio of approximately 7.5%, an improvement relative to our prior outlook. I'll now discuss our 2021 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we now expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $5.8 billion, representing growth of at least 8% over 2020, reflecting the significant value we create for our customers and clients. For U.S. Medical, we now expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $3.5 billion. Underlying this updated outlook, we now expect the 2021 medical care ratio to be in the range of 83% to 84%, driven by our updated medical cost expectations for the second half of 2021 as I previously discussed. Regarding total medical customers, we continue to expect 2021 growth of at least 350,000 customers. All-in, for full year 2021, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of at least $20.20, with the underlying drivers being an increase in expected earnings from Evernorth, a decrease in expected earnings from U.S. Medical driven by a higher medical care ratio, a more favorable outlook for operating expenses and other contributions that are net favorable for the year. Now moving to our 2021 capital management position and outlook. We expect our businesses to continue to drive strong cash flows and returns on capital, even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. I would highlight that we had some timing related items, which impacted cash flow from operations during the second quarter. For full year 2021, we continue to expect at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well-performing businesses. Year-to-date, as of August 4th, 2021, we have repurchased about 18 million shares for about $4.1 billion. And we now expect full year 2021 weighted average shares of 344 million to 345 million shares. On July 28th, we declared a $1 per share dividend payable on September 23rd to shareholders of record as of September 8th. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins, and attractive returns on capital. So now to recap. Results in the second quarter reflects strong top line growth with contributions across our businesses. Additionally, we acknowledged that the environment remains fluid as evidenced by the impact of elevated medical costs in the second quarter and on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Even with this additional pressure, our diversified portfolio and multiple earnings levers have positioned us to achieve our outlook for full year 2021, all while continuing to support our customers, clients, and coworkers. We continue to expect 2021 full year adjusted earnings of at least $20.20 per share and have continued confidence in delivering our long-term EPS growth rate that will average 10% to 13% per year. With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Appreciate all the thoughts there. On the increased outlook for the medical cost ratio and what's you're giving us relative to COVID and non-COVID, it looks like my math is right about two-thirds of the increase in MLR would be related to the COVID costs, given the $1.25, now it's $2.50 EPS headwind. And I guess that would mean the remaining is the non-COVID. I want to just confirm that. And would the COVID costs be spread relatively evenly over the course of the year, rest of the year Q2, Q3, Q4, and then does that become a tailwind for 2022 is hopefully that reverses. Brian Evanko : Good morning A.J. It\u2019s Brian. So, a few different questions in there. I'll try to give you the overall picture. So, as I said my prepared comments there, we now anticipate about a $2.50 earnings per share headwind in 2021 associated with COVID and of that approximately 80% impacts to medical care ratio, and approximately 20% is related to enrollment levels being depressed here in 2021. Focusing on the $2 per share COVID-related headwind, that's impacting the medical care ratio, there's a few components underlying that. So, one would be the impact of Medicare Advantage risk adjuster revenue headwinds here in 2021. The other component of it is the level of total cost of care that we're experiencing in 2021 compared to our prior expectations, which includes both COVID direct costs. And it also includes non-COVID costs that returned earlier than we anticipated during the year here. And so, I wouldn't necessarily parse the two-thirds, one-third, the way that you did, but rather look at the total cost picture, be more elevated in comparison to what we had previously expected. COVID costs were highest for us in the first quarter. Within the second quarter, they were higher in April than they were in May and June. And we expect for the balance of the year that COVID costs will run at a lower level than they did in the first half of the year. So, that's what's embedded in our outlook. And as I said, the non-COVID utilization, we're anticipating to run at approximately baseline levels for the back half of the year. That plus the COVID costs we expect to incur leads us to all-in cost levels at slightly above our baseline for the back half of 2021. As it relates to what we expect to unwind heading into 2022, again, if you parse apart the components of that $2 I was just making reference to, the Medicare Advantage risk adjuster headwind, we expect to fully recover in 2022. So, between our bid strategies and the operational activities we're seeing, we have a full confidence that we'll fully recover that component. The components related to total cost of care, we expect to recover a portion of that in 2022. And so, a portion of that will come through pricing actions. A portion of that will come through clinical management activities and a portion of that we expect to be a little bit of natural abatement in aggravated costs between 2021 and 2022. So, we're currently estimating that about half of that $2 per share headwind will come back in 2022 in the form of incremental earnings. So, think about $1 of the $2.50 EPS headwind returning into the P&L in 2002. A.J. Rice: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Mr. Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning. Just staying on that topic. I think last quarter you had also suggested that, growth would be at or above the high-end in 2022. I think off that 2020 baseline, I guess, is that still the case? So the way to think about it is sort of at or above the high-end, and then add back that dollar that you just said Brian? Thanks. David Cordani : Ralph, good morning. It's David. So, as we think about 2022, clearly, early to give you a detailed guidance, but let me try to walk through the moving parts as we think about 2022. Underlying our outlook will be strong base earnings growth, contributions from ongoing capital deployment, and the recovery of some of the headwind that Brian articulated. There'll be an offset to that. Partially offsetting that will be, the lack of some of the non-run-ratable items we're realizing in our 2021, at least $20.20 EPS outlook. So when you take it all together, we expect 2022 will be another strong year for us. As relates to growth rates, the way I ask you to think about that is, first off, I take at least $20.20. When we adjust that for the non-renewable items, we would expect to grow at the high-end of our 10% to 13% range. Another way of thinking about it, if you take at least $20.20 outlook for 2020, we would expect to grow at least 10% on that. So, a net new item, that was the non-run-ratable items that we'll have in 2022, but an attractive growth rate on either parameter, as we expect to have another strong year for 2022. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. Our next question comes from Mr. Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Matthew Borsch : Yes. Thank you. I was hoping you could maybe just talk a little bit about the individual business, which has been volatile for some companies and the extent to which you saw that and how much that may or may not be contributing to headwinds you are seeing? David Cordani : Matthew, good morning. It's David. From the individual business portfolio, as you know, we've been active in that marketplace since its inception. And after a few years of test and learn and the marketplace stabilizing itself, we sought and began to more systematically expand our growth and that carries into the current year. As relates to the performance in the current year, we have some attractive growth in that business, both underlying fundamental growth, as well as growth contribution from the SEP period. And as it relates to the core of your question on performance, I'd asked you to think about the underlying -- what we're seeing the underlying performance of that book of business is similar to the trends and impact that Brian articulated before. So, we see an uptick in utilization within that book of business, more approximating from a non-COVID standpoint, baseline activity with some additional utilization on the COVID side of the equation. And lastly, our early look at the SEP, special enrollment period, additional lives, those lives are performing similar to other special enrollment period lives we've observed before. So, some of the MLR that we're seeing across our broader portfolio is showing through in the individual business, but not up proportion in either way from the overall behavior of that book. Matthew Borsch : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. I want to try to squeeze in a question and a follow-up here. So, first, you talked about 2Q being above baseline in terms of non-COVID costs in U.S. Commercial. I just want to ask how far above baseline versus that 100%. And did you say you expected to return down to do a 100% or do you expect that to continue at that level into the back half of the year?  And then my follow-up was to Ralph's question, you're -- I just want to make sure we understand 2022 here. Are you saying they're going to grow 10% off 2020 or $20.20 plus a $1, or is the 10% the total number and David, you keep talking to these non-recurring costs. Can you just delineate what those are and how -- what's driving them and how big the non-recurring items are for this year? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Justin. This is Brian. I'll start and then David to pile on here. So, on the first part of your question there, if I misspoke, I apologize. For the second quarter our non-COVID utilization or commercial was essentially at baseline, that plus the direct COVID-19 related costs we incurred put the total cost picture above baseline, but the non-COVID utilization was at baseline. For the back half of the year within our commercial business, we're expecting that non-COVID utilization will continue to run at baseline and we will incur direct COVID-19 related costs, but at a lower level than what we saw in the first half of the year. So, hopefully that clarifies a bit the commentary around commercial and the assumptions on the back half. Relative to the non-recurring items that you asked about, you can think about those as largely being SG&A oriented, with the bulk of it being associated with litigation from prior years where we had some favorable developments in the quarter, that allowed us to recognize some gains there. So, boxing that just directionally, you should think of it as about $150 million after tax. So think of it in the range of $0.45, $0.50 earnings per share in terms of the favorable benefit that we've seen here in 2021. David, you want to clarify on the 2022 commentary. David Cordani : Sure. So, Justin, crosswalk again. First from prior dialogue, as you recall, we would have talked about base earnings, capital deployment, and a recovery of COVID headwind as contributor to our 2022 expectations for ourselves. And that remains, the base performance, the capital deployment and recovery of COVID headwind. As Brian articulated with the COVID headwind, that opportunity is a little greater now for 2022 than it was a quarter of ago from that perspective. The net new item is what Brian walked through, which are the non-reoccurring items. And he gave you approximate order of magnitude. So, again, to repeat to the specific part of your question, we believe today, if you take the at least $20.20 that we will deliver for this year, our growth rate will be at least 10%. We believe if you take the -- at least $20.20 and adjusted for those non-reoccurring items, that we referenced -- that Brian just referenced, the growth rate will approximate 13% or so. So, those are the moving parts relative to our expectations for 2022 on either convention another year for strong, attractive balance performance. Justin Lake : And David, just to be clear, that includes the dollar, so you are growing 10% with the dollar. David Cordani : No. It includes, Justin, the dollar. So, let's come back -- and previously we would have talked about baseline earnings, capital deployment and the recovery of the headwind. That's what took us to the high-end of the range versus within the range. It currently -- the expectation includes that, but the dollar is somewhat offset by the lack of the non-run-ratable items next year. So, on an all-in basis, we'll grow in the 10% to 13% range, depending on the convention you use, either the $20.20, we will grow at least 10% all-in, or if you look at it, excluding the non-recurring items, that Brian just articulated, about $0.50 we will grow at about 13% all-in. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Ms. Lisa Gill with JP Morgan. You may ask your question. Lisa Gill : Great. Thanks very much and good morning. David, I'm just wondered if I can ask about the PBM, was really strong in the quarter. First, can you talk about the 2022 selling season and how that plays into the outlook that that you're talking about right now? And then secondly, can you tell us that the number of vaccines that are included in that, that script count, just want to get a better idea of what you're seeing on overall script count, including vaccines? David Cordani : Good morning, Lisa. I'll talk about the growth outlook in the environment and then I'll ask Brian to come back in and talk about the script count, specifically the vaccine. First, we're very pleased with the performance of the Evernorth portfolio. The durable nature of that and an environment of disruption provides some diversification within the portfolio and the service delivery for our clients, health plan clients, corporate clients, government clients remains quite strong. As it relates to the underlying growth rate, our growth in 2021 outstanding for that portfolio and we'll continue to see expected growth for 2022. As we discussed previously, we've known for some time that we have lack of renewal of two health plan clients. So, we knew that, and even with that, we will grow again in 2022 at an attractive rate. We also recognize that given our strong performance, we've been able to maintain appropriate pricing discipline, as we looked at the 2022 environment. So, take it as a whole, an active dynamic year for 2022. We'd expect another strong year of retention, even acknowledging those health plan clients in the mid-90s. And we would expect strong underlying growth of the Evernorth portfolio. Brian, I'll ask you to talk about the vaccine volumes within our scripts for the quarter. Brian Evanko : Sure. Morning, Lisa. So, in the second quarter, we fulfilled 9 million of vaccine related scripts. So, out of the 410 million adjusted scripts that we fulfilled in the quarter, about 9 million of those were associated with a vaccine, obviously that's not something to run rate, given we would not expect that level to persist for the balance of the year, but 2%, 3% of the total script volume. Lisa Gill : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Gill. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. You may ask your question. Steve Valiquette : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So, I guess, just back on the medical cost for a moment, just curious if you have any additional color on the medical costs ran versus baseline by cost category, for example, inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, et cetera. And some MCO have called up, behavioral health and also diagnostic and lab work as cost categories that are trending above baseline. I'm curious if you're seeing those same trends as well. Thanks. David Cordani : Good morning. It's David. Let me provide a little overview and I'll ask Brian to provide some specifics of what we're seeing in terms of some of the specific categories of utilization. You did call out an important category we've unequivocally seen, and I noted in my prepared comments, the mental health or behavioral and substance abuse category is growing. We see more individuals needing and utilizing those services, and appropriately needing and utilizing those services given the environment and our portfolio is really well-positioned to provide that level of support necessary. And we believe that it's not only appropriate required. It will provide some intermediate and long-term benefit to those individuals, obviously to clients, as well as to ourselves on a sustainable basis. Beyond that, we've seen an uptick in -- from prior levels and uptick in both inpatient and outpatient surgeries in the non-COVID category. And as Brian articulated, that categories more broadly approximated baseline levels, and we've assumed that we'll remain at that for the second half of the year. I'll ask Brian to give you a little bit more color in terms of some of the insights we're seeing in terms of the more detailed utilization patterns. Brian Evanko : Yeah. Sure, David and good morning, Steve. So, just to reiterate David's point, surgeries in particular were a hotspot for us, both in terms of inpatient, outpatient activity in the quarter. We also saw overall outpatient and professional utilization pick up pretty meaningfully in the quarter. Emergency room utilization, radiology remained below baseline in the quarter and kind of within these different categories, there was also some state of service shift, which is a good thing over time. We saw inpatient shift outpatient, particularly for some lower acuity procedures. And we saw some of the emergency room utilization shift, urgent care centers and physician offices, which we view as a good thing from the standpoint of optimizing, like to care. On your point about behavioral health, a metric that I'll share with you just relative to prior to the pandemic. Within our U.S. Commercial book, in 2019 about 8% of our customers were utilizing behavioral health services. And as you know, we have an industry-leading capability in this space. This year, that number is going to be up almost 40%. So, we're going to have nearly 11% of our customers this year, utilizing behavioral health services, which we think is a good thing for the long-term. It's putting a little bit of pressure on the P&L this year, but we believe it's a good thing for the long-term, and our recent acquisition of MDLIVE offers us the opportunity to further synergize that given the demand for virtual behavioral health has grown meaningfully over the course of the pandemic. Steve Valiquette : Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our next question comes from Mr. Scott Fidel with Stephens. You may ask your question. Scott Fidel : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I'm interested if you can just break down the 20% of the COVID headwind that's from the lower customer volumes, maybe a little more insight into that in terms of some of the key customer segments for you in terms of where you're seeing more of that drag. And then, also just want to -- just confirm on the $4 billion revenue raised. If you can also just break that down by segments. It feels like Evernorth is probably the bulk of that growth, but just want to confirm that in terms of the segment, the breakdown of the $4 billion of revenue heads. Thanks. David Cordani : Good morning, Scott. It's David. Let me speak to the headwind and I'll Brian speak to the revenue raise. If I understand your question correctly, you're coming out the portion of the headwind that is non-MCR related. And broadly, we see the impact of the pandemic on employment levels within the commercial population broadly. We had previously called that out as a headwind. We previously called that as a headwind that we believed would return as a favorable tailwind over time. We're taking the posture right now that given the current employment environment, that headwind will more likely persist or set otherwise that's the baseline with which to grow off of. We'll continue to grow no doubt, but that's the baseline to grow off of as we observed the marketplace and the overall employment levels beginning to move forward, but more slowly than anticipated in a variety of sectors. So, view it as disenrollment and/or aggregate employment levels, and the requisite level of changing those employment levels, having and flowing at a slower rate, given the prolonged pandemic. I'll let Brian speak a bit more towards the $4 billion revenue raise. Brian Evanko : Sure. Morning, Scott. So, relative to the revenue outlook, obviously we're very pleased with the aggregate growth for the company this year. Of the $4 billion, you should think of the lion's share of that being driven by Evernorth. So think of it as roughly 75-25 with the other segments and in totality Evernorth is on track for a year where both revenue and earnings will grow above well -- above our long-term average annual expectation 4% to 6%. So, we're really pleased with the performance of that business. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fidel. Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. Great. Thanks. I guess, the higher utilization that you're seeing this quarter, I guess, is internally surprising given what other companies are seeing so far this earning season. I guess, the question I'd have though is, what gives you confidence that this higher trend is not the beginning of an overall -- or this higher cost in the quarter is not the beginning of an overall higher trend that makes 2022 pricing at risk. I guess, what gives you that comment? I would think that a faster return to normal in Q2 would be the first thing you saw before you saw above average trend overall. So, why isn't that a concern? Brian Evanko : Good morning, Kevin. It\u2019s Brian. So, appreciate the question. If you think about how the second quarter unfolded, I think this is instructive for how we think about the back half of the year and into 2022. So, April, we saw the highest level of COVID costs. As I said earlier, those tracked downward pretty meaningfully in May, in June and the total cost of care when you combine the COVID and non-COVID costs together in the months of May and June is more in line with what we're expecting for the back half of 2021 and as we step into 2022. So, for those reasons, based on the more emergent data, we feel better about the next 18 months as compared to the first four months of the year where we had particularly elevated costs in our book. David, anything you want to add? David Cordani : Yeah. Good morning, Kevin. The only item I would add is, as we think about our book of business, approximately two-thirds of our risk business is yet to be priced for 2022. So, as you know, it's not all -- that portfolio of our business is not all one, one or front end loaded from that standpoint. So, we have the opportunity be appropriately responsive as the marketplace changes, but the underlying assumptions that Brian articulated in the medical cost pattern are the most important part of it. Kevin Fischbeck : But I guess you're saying that you got back to normal faster in Q2 than your original guidance, assumed you would get back to normal sort of price. So, again, that feels to be like the trajectory is higher. Why would it get higher and then level off, I guess, in the back half of the year? David Cordani : Sure. The underlying question comes back to, as Brian broke up -- broke out the portions of it. We essentially are looking at an environment in the second half of the year where the medical cost environment will be slightly above baseline. And the pieces of that are that the non-COVID or the -- call, traditional parts of medical costs approximately baseline in the commercial portfolio and above and beyond that there's some additional load for COVID. So, one would have to believe that either A, the non-COVID costs are going to run above baseline for some reason that they haven't to date when we look at the way we built up the policy for baseline and/or that the additional COVID costs that we're saying are additive to that, will be materially greater, right? So, we acknowledge it's the fluid environment beyond a shadow of a doubt, but we believe that the estimate we've made for the step-up in aggregate for the rest of the year to run slightly above baseline, is an appropriate assessment based upon the pattern we saw in the end of the first quarter and the way in which the second quarter was evolved and developed and as I noted that we have about two-thirds of the risk business yet to be priced for 2022. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Mr. Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question. Josh Raskin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to talk a little about the MLR. I know you guys stopped disclosing that MLR by segment a while back, but I was wondering if you just give us some color on the changes in the MLR in the second quarter, even the first half of the year for the commercial book, and maybe specifically that individual book of business, if that was different than the overall commercial? And then relative to Medicare Advantage, and maybe as a side, how much of the MA increase was risk adjuster related versus medical cost related? Brian Evanko : Good morning, Josh. This is Brian. So, a few different components there, the question. Big picture compared to our expectations, I would encourage you to think about the three books of business, meaning the commercial risk, the individual exchange, and the Medicare Advantage, as all being approximately off by the same amount compared to our expectations in terms of total claim costs. So, I'd start there in terms of, we are not seeing one being really disproportionately impacted relative to our prior expectations. They're all off by, call it, that 200 basis points or so that changed in our MCR guide. The Medicare Advantage business though in 2021 is further weighed down by the risk adjustment revenue headwinds. So, you should view the margins on the Medicare Advantage business as being particularly low relative to what our long-term expectations are. And as we step into 2022, we would expect margin expansion on each of those books of business off of what we're experiencing here in 2021. As it relates to the risk adjuster headwind, that's a component of the $2 per share headwind. We haven't specifically sized that. It's certainly a less than half of that. I would note, we recently received our mid-year settlement from CMS, which was favorable to our expectations, which gives us a further confidence in our ability to fully recover that headwind in 2022. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Rajiv Garg - UBS: Hi. Good morning. This is Rajiv Garg on for Kevin. Just wanted to quickly follow-up and see if there was any updates to your longer term targets provided on your Investor Day? Or are you still comfortable with those overall? Thank you. Brian Evanko : Sure. Good morning. Our longer term targets are consistent, and we remain committed to them. And to remind everybody, it\u2019s our attractive revenue growth rate of 6% to 8%, our EPS growth rate of 10% to 13% with the dividend above and beyond that. And our outlook of operating cash flow generation from current year to 2025 of approximately $50 billion. Those numbers are on average over a prolonged period of time. And as we've identified at Investor Day as well, as you look back over the last decade, we have a track record of delivering against those targets and objectives. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Caliendo. Our last -- our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Lance Wilkes : Yeah. Good morning, guys. I have a question on strategic capital deployment. And if you could just talk through a little bit of long-term, like five years out or so, what do you think is the mix of businesses you\u2019re expecting thinking of kind of employer managed care, government managed care, PBM and other services? And as you\u2019re out looking at things and contemplating that, what\u2019s the landscape like as far as attractiveness of opportunities, just availability of targets and the like. And within that value-based care, home care, Medicaid, are there any new views on categories that you\u2019d be interested in? David Cordani : Lance, good morning. It\u2019s David. Appreciate the forward-looking orientation relative to that. To answer your question, we got a ground back into our portfolio. The three platforms we have, which we feel very positively about, the services based platform within Evernorth, the U.S. Medical platform, both Commercial and Government, and then our International platform. We see attractive growth opportunities organically and inorganically in all three as we look to the future. Specifically, you start -- your real thoughtful question in terms of kind of apportionment five years out. We don\u2019t have a rigid target five years out that we want X percent in category A or Y percent in category Z. But however, we do see an environment where the services portion of our portfolio will continue to grow at an accelerated rate. We see the right to win, the ability to create value and our strategic position there for the multiple client segments we\u2019re able to serve there as being quite attractive, and you should expect this to continue to grow our pharmacy, our care, our benefits and our intelligence capability to be able to bring to bear against that. Secondly, we\u2019ve continued to call out U.S. Government as an attractive growth segment and that will transpire both organically and inorganically, as opportunities present themselves. And thirdly, we continue to see targeted opportunities in our International portfolio as attractive growth opportunities. On a final note, you articulated examples of home care, otherwise, et cetera, I won\u2019t call out any one precise example. But I\u2019ll step back and remind you, as we\u2019ve talked about it, we see what we call alternative sites of care. So, virtual -- longitudinal virtual, polychronic, home care, coordinated home care as attractive additional growth opportunities within our service portfolio, and we continue to extend ourselves and expand ourselves within that space. So, multiple strategic alternatives. Second, strong platforms to build off of. Third, the capital flexibility to be able to grow in multiple attractive markets that you appropriately called out. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Wilkes. Our next question comes from Mr. Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Ricky Goldwasser : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So, a couple of questions here. First of all, on the acuity levels, I mean, I understand that sort of new members are coming in at similar profile to existing. But are you seeing any increase in acuity for the existing book? I noted last quarter you talked about the preventive cartelization at pre-pandemic levels. So, just wondering -- trying to understand how it compares in second quarter and what are you seeing in terms of acuity. And then, just as a follow-up on your point on expansion into U.S. Government, just kind of like if you can give us maybe a little bit more direction in terms you looking more at Medicare versus Medicaid. And should we think about expansion on the medical side, or is it more in sort of the adjacent areas and more sort of kind of like the PBM side, the pharmacy service that could be expanded into sort of the Medicare and Medicaid market? Thank you. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Ricky. It\u2019s Brian. I\u2019ll take the acuity portion of the question and David to tackle the government component. So, big picture, we\u2019re not yet seeing signs of any meaningfully higher acuity amongst our customer base. Part of that due to the focus we\u2019ve had on preventive care, as you indicated in your question, as well as appropriate behavioral health utilization as we talked about earlier. There are a variety of metrics that we use to track this. And just one really specific one I\u2019ll give you, we track within our commercial book of business when we have new cancer diagnosis, how many of them are at a metastatic stage when they\u2019re first diagnosed. And so, prior to the pandemic, if you look at the top five cancer types, we saw 38% to 39% of these in a metastatic stage when they presented to us. In 2021, we\u2019re in that same range, 38% to 39%. So, that\u2019s an indicator that we track one of many that suggests we do not yet have those signs of acuity spikes. And as I said earlier, we\u2019re also seeing a site of service shifts in the book of business, which is a mitigant over time to the potential for a QE coming back into the book. David, maybe you want to talk a little bit about the government part of the question. David Cordani : Sure, Ricky. Good morning. The short answer is we see expansion opportunities in both the U.S. Medical side of the equation, as well as in the Evernorth services side. So, more specifically, within the U.S. Medical portfolio organically, we see and are continuing to deliver and pursue additional growth opportunities for both our Medicare Advantage portfolio in existing geographies as well as, as we\u2019ve discussed before, our continued expansion of those geographies and leveraging our broader product portfolio and platform, as well as in our exchange portfolio as we continue to expand our individual exchange portfolio, which we view as more government business versus not. On the services side, you referenced pharmacy unequivocally, but expanded beyond pharmacy to care and benefit management services, as well as intelligent services. For example, as we look to continue to serve our expanding portfolio of health plan clients, they have diverse portfolios that they serve, commercial obviously, Medicare, Medicaid, exchange and otherwise. That\u2019s an important part of our growth chassis as we go forward with dedicated resources. And then ultimately, direct to government contractor relationships as well. So, we see attractive growth opportunities in the government space, both off of the health plan side of the business in the Cigna medical portfolio, as well as in the services side of the business through Evernorth. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Goldwasser. Our next question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James. You may ask your question. John Ransom : Hey, I\u2019m going to ask about a happy topic, because you guys have been beaten up this morning, and I want you to end on a happy note. The -- if we go back particular time period, 12, 18, 24 months, obviously, the PBM side of Evernorth has done a lot better than I think anybody expected. Can you kind of point to the top one, two or three reasons why that is? And then secondly, if we think about the profit model of the PBM, how has that shifted away from kind of adjudication straight dollars and toward things like mail order and kind of backward fees into pharma that presumably might be a bit more sticky than some of the ways of making money? Thanks. David Cordani : Sure. Good morning, John. It\u2019s David. I'll start relative to your question. And I appreciate the tone, but candidly, I don\u2019t feel beaten up. These are dynamic and challenging times. And we\u2019re proud of the fact that our portfolio, our diverse portfolio can perform in this environment and importantly, deliver for our clients, our customers and patients, while we deliver our responsibilities from a shareholder perspective. But I appreciate the tone of your question. Now, specifically, as you go back in time, when we brought this portfolio together in terms of the companies, we viewed obviously that we had an opportunity to bring in a leading PBM portfolio of services, but it was broader than that. Secondly, we viewed, as we talk about now, that pharmacological innovation was a big part of the future of healthcare. And the acceleration of innovation is what we\u2019re seeing today through a whole variety of things, gene therapy, specialty, medications evolving, biosimilars, et cetera. And hence, if you\u2019re going to be helping individuals with their overall healthcare needs, being a leader in pharmacy services is mission-critical. We also saw the opportunity to expand that portfolio through a broader services platform, which we did through Evernorth, and then continue to feed that broader services platform for health plan clients, for corporate clients, for our government clients, et cetera. And as we\u2019ve noted -- both Brian and I have noted, we\u2019re very pleased with the performance within the portfolio and the service we\u2019re delivering. And importantly, we continue to invest in that portfolio at an accelerating rate relative to expanding products, services, capabilities, as well as our reach. Now as it relates to the profit model, the primary mechanisms would articulate for you to think about is back to the time you referenced, we acknowledge that the financing models were going to change, and we didn\u2019t resist that. We offer choice. We offer choice in terms of how purchasers or clients want to finance their offering. And we\u2019ve evolved, for example, with a higher percentage of pass-through arrangements for clients in the PBM services from well less than 50% to 50% to well greater than 50% over three cycles. And we\u2019ve been able to evolve our service based capabilities and our value creation capabilities for the benefit of clients. Secondly, we continue to press for more aligned relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers on the clinical outcomes, not just the consumptions. We know that broadly in the industry is value based programs, but think about them as aligned programs. And then lastly, as the biosimilars start to evolve at a more rapid rate, the positioning of our company to have the clinical depth, the coordination of clinical services, the manufacturer relationships and importantly, the medical physician relationships are mission-critical. And as I use the Remicade example, all those come to bear, because it\u2019s a patient-by-patient decision made with a practicing physician relative to the choices and alternatives. So, again, I appreciate your question. We\u2019re pleased with the performance, but maybe even more importantly than that underlying your question, we\u2019re delighted with the strategic position that the platform gives us right now to continue to drive growth and create value going forward. John Ransom : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Ransom. Our next question comes from Mr. David Windley with Jefferies. Your line is open. You may ask your question. David Windley : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, David, if I go back to your growth construct and think about a $20.20 minus the one-timers and grow that by 13%, it would seem that the dollar recovery for next year represents maybe 40% of that growth next year. Can you talk about the factors that you see at this point that would be limiting on your core business apart from the dollar. So, it looks like that would be mid to high single digit growth including capital deployment. And so, that would obviously be below your trend line. What are the factors limiting the core business apart from the dollar? Thank you. David Cordani : Dave, good morning. So, again, it\u2019s early for the detailed 2022 guidance, but taking the spirit of your question, it ultimately is going to come down to two things. Rate and pace of evolution of the cost environment -- medical cost environment, and rate and pace of our investment portfolio decisions within the organization positioning us for the future. We have a track record of sustained investment in the organization for long-term growth. We have -- as Brian articulated earlier, we have multiple growth and profit levers, and we\u2019ll seek to make trade-offs within that and ensure that we seek to deliver an attractive, sustainable result. So, I think those are the two major points I\u2019d ask you to think about. I talked about the growth rate in framework of at least. So, we weren\u2019t providing guidance to pencil a number rather how we\u2019re thinking about the growth platforms and trajectory. And there\u2019s nothing in our underlying business portfolio today. I\u2019ll leave you with, there\u2019s nothing in our underlying business portfolio today that suggests that the organic underlying growth of our earnings will be demonstrably different unless we determine we\u2019re going to make a trade-off in terms of rate and pace of investment within the portfolio or there\u2019s an exogenous impact for the industry on the cost side of the equation. We\u2019re just trying to frame the at least growth rates off of what we know now mid-year. David Windley : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. David Cordani : Thank you, David. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Mr. Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question. Stephen Baxter : Yeah. Hi. Sorry to come back to a more near term and less happy topic. Just thinking about the back half discussion and sort of the progression from where we were in MLR in the second quarter to the back half. It looks like you need MLR to decline a couple of hundred bps sequentially to kind of make that work. So, just in terms of thinking about it, it\u2019d be really helpful if you could potentially quantify what you\u2019re thinking about COVID costs in the back half of the year relative to the second quarter. And how we should balance that against sort of the typical deductible seasonality that we\u2019d expect to be pushing up MLR sequentially in a more normal year? Thank you. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Steve. It\u2019s Brian. So, I would encourage you to think of the year in two halves, one half and two half. So, the first half, we ran at 83.6% MCR, and we\u2019re modeling the back half to perform at approximately that same level if you use the mid-point of our guidance. So, rather than looking at quarter-by-quarter, because there\u2019s quite a bit of variability that\u2019s transpired in the different months. But big picture, the first half of the year, we ran a few points above baseline in total when you combine the effect of COVID and non-COVID utilization together. For the back half of the year, we\u2019re projecting to run slightly above the baseline in totality and that\u2019s comprised of non-COVID utilization running approximately at baseline, plus COVID utilization on top of that. To your question on how does that pattern relative to what we saw in the first half? You should think of the direct COVID-19 related costs as being the highest in the first quarter, lower in the second quarter and we\u2019re modeling slightly lower than that for the back half of the year on direct COVID-19 related costs. So, those pieces get you to that overall expectation of slightly above baseline for the back half of the year, and that essentially offsets the seasonality we would typically see in the MCR pattern for our book of business. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Baxter. I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : Sure. I\u2019ll be brief. I want to thank everybody for joining our call. And I just want to reinforce two points. First, I'm appreciative and proud of our more than 70,000 coworkers and their dedication to working to change our customers' lives for the better every day. They continue to rise to the challenges in the moment by helping our clients, our customers, our patients, working with our partners and in our communities to drive positive change. And second, we continue to demonstrate the resiliency of our business and our well-positioned three portfolios, and the strength of our strategic framework, given our results and our outlook. With that, I ask you to have a good day, and we look forward to our future conversations. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna second quarter 2021 results review.

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter queue to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Ms. Alexis Jones. Please go ahead, Ms. Jones. Alexis Jones : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Alexis Jones, Lead Principal for Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Evanko, Cigna 's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna 's Third Quarter 2021 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2021.  As noted in our earnings release when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the US, otherwise known as GAAP.  A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders Net Income and total revenues respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2021 and future performance. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release, and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.  Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the third quarter, we recorded an after-tax special item benefit of $35 million or $0.10 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues on our discussion of financial results.  Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full-year 2021 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2021 dividend s, and does not assume any impact from any business combinations or divestitures that may occur after today, such as our recently announced planned divestiture of Life, Accident, and Supplemental Benefits businesses outside of the U.S., which we expect to close in 2022. With that, I will turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks, Alexis. And thank you to everyone for joining us on our call today. This morning I'm going to spend a few minutes talking about our strong results for the quarter, how we are advancing our growth strategy, and I'll provide some additional perspective on our 2022 outlook, and then Brian will share some more details about our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, and then we'll take your questions. Let's jump in. During the quarter we delivered adjusted revenue of $44 billion, and adjusted EPS of $5.73 per share, all while continuing to reinvest back in our business to fund growth, expansion, and ongoing innovation, and we continue to return significant value to our shareholders.  These results reinforce we are delivering for our customers, our patients, clients, provider partners, as well as for you, our shareholders. With our high performing health service portfolio and sharp focus on executing our strategy, we are confident in our ability to continue driving growth and are again raising our full-year 2001 guidance for adjusted EPS and revenue. Our performance is strong, considering the ongoing impact of the pandemic on medical costs, as well as the higher claims we've experienced amongst the special enrollment period or SCP customers within our individual business.  As it relates to our MCR in the quarter, our commercial business did improve from the second quarter to the third quarter, and our Medicare Advantage business also improved sequentially. We continue to execute a series of actions in 2021 and 2022 to further improve our MCR. And Brian will walk through this in more detail in a few moments. Separately in early October, we also announced an agreement with Chubb to sell our Life, Accident and Supplemental Benefits business in our international markets platform in 7 countries from $5.7 billion -- $5.75 billion. We expect to realize about $5.4 billion in net after-tax proceeds and to complete the transaction in 2022 following regulatory approvals.  Guided by our strategy and similar to our 2020 divestiture of our group insurance business, this transaction unlocks the value of the best-in-class leading asset, while also enabling us to even more sharply focus our business on health and well-being services. So overall, our performance for the quarter reflects our clear strategy and strong execution and delivering attractive results, and importantly, our ongoing commitment to prioritize and support the evolving health and well-being needs of those we serve. Now, I'll walk through some additional detail for our Evernorth and U.S. medical businesses. A year-ago we launched Evernorth to tip the marketplace as our health service platform, focused on servicing health plans, employers, government organizations, and healthcare providers. Since that time, Evernorth has established itself with unique partnerships and innovative services that are resonating with multiple buyer groups. Our Evernorth pharmacy and our medical offerings through our U.S. medical platform are the 2 primary gateways through which most of our clients and customers form their base relationship with us.  Wrapping around these two exceptionally strong platforms are additional suites of Innovative Health Services through Evernorth, including benefits management, care solutions, and intelligent solutions. These help us to expand and deepen existing relationships. In the third quarter, Evernorth retained and expanded our relationship with the Department of Defense TRICARE pharmacy program, and renewed a 7-year contract. It's our privilege to serve almost 10 million active-duty service members, retirees, and their families.  Evernorth will continue supporting TRICARE pharmacy operations, including specialty pharmacy services, military pharmacy claims, and retail network pharmacies. The new contract also allows for expansion of specialty and care coordination services through 2029. As we look to the balance of the year and into 2022, Evernorth will continue to grow revenue and earnings. Turning to our U.S. Medical platform. In U.S. commercial, our teams are leveraging in deploying the innovative solutions from Evernorth to expand our service offerings and address the evolving needs of our clients and customers. For example, in our U.S. commercial platform, we are leveraging Evernorth 's MDLIVE capabilities to expand virtual care options for our customers through their employers with primary, urgent, behavioral, and dermatology care. As part of these value-based arrangements during virtual visits, MDLIVE physicians are leveraging our Evernorth intelligence capabilities, enabling them to provide more connected and coordinated experience. And we continue to expand our capabilities with MDLIVE as we recently launched a virtual-first health plan for employers.  Another great example of Evernorth in U.S. commercial partnering to bring more value to our health plan clients is a new arrangement we have with University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Health Plan. We will make in-network care available to UPMC customers who live, work, or travel outside their network service area. UPMC has been an Evernorth pharmacy client for 16 years, and this agreement illustrates how we are collaborating across our enterprise to deliver greater affordability and differentiated value for health plan clients.  We are pleased how the market continues to recognize the value we are delivering through our broad suite of solutions, and as such, we continue to grow through both our U.S. commercial and Evernorth platforms. Within Medicare Advantage, consistent with our strategy, we continue to grow in our existing markets and are expanding into new geographies. Our progress is further supported by our overall value of our offerings. For the 2022 calendar year, 89% of our Medicare Advantage customers will be in 4-star or greater plans nationally.  This is the highest level we've ever achieved, and it marks the 5th year in a row we've improved our stars performance. And at our Individual and Family Plan business, we've driven strong growth in this year, increasing customers by 47% through the third quarter. A substantial portion of this growth did come from the extended special enrollment period. As I previously noted, some of the MCR impact in the third quarter was driven by the medical cost, amongst those we added during the outpaced SEP growth.  We do expect this will moderate in 2022. We are positioning ourselves to build on this momentum in the individual and family plan business by expanding our addressable markets again as we enter in 3 new states and 93 new counties in 2022. These new markets offer the potential to reach an additional 1.5 million customers. The continued strength of our results and the growth we're generating through the execution of our strategy gives us confidence we will deliver against our commitments in 2021.  We will deliver EPS in line with our long-term targets and revenue growth well above our long-term targets for yet another year. We will also deliver EPS within our long-term target range in 2022. Specifically, for 2021, we are committed to delivering our increased guidance for full-year adjusted EPS of at least $20.35. For full-year 2021, we remain on track for generating at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations and we expect to return more than $7 billion to shareholders in 2021 through dividends and share repurchase. Looking to 2022, we expect to grow EPS by at least 10% off of our increased 2021 guidance of at least $20.35 per share. We anticipate a number of tailwinds, including core growth in our business and additional contributions from margin expansion in our U.S. Medical business as we drive pricing actions, execute affordability and efficiency initiatives and benefit from the return of Medicare risk adjustment revenue to more normalized levels. We're also expecting year-over-year headwind as we plan for net investment income to be more in line with historical levels.  And of course, the rate and pace of ongoing strategic investments will vary from year-to-year. In short, 2022 will be another strong year for Cigna. Now to briefly summarize, as we've demonstrated through the quarter, and throughout 2021, we are delivering for our customers, patients, clients, and provider partners as they experience the ongoing challenges of the pandemic.  We're also taking significant value enhancing actions, such as divesting a portion of our international business, returning substantial amounts of capital to our shareholders, and continuing to strategically invest in our capabilities and strategic partnerships. All of which position us to continue to advance our long-term growth agenda and continued to deliver shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian Evanko : Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will review key aspects of Cigna 's third quarter results, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business. And I will discuss our updated outlook for the full year. During the quarter, total medical costs were higher than our expectations within our U.S. Medical segment. Driven largely by the impact of the Delta variant in our U.S. commercial business and increased medical costs for special enrollment period customers in our U.S. individual business. Importantly, I would remind you that approximately 80% of our revenues are from service-based businesses that are not significantly exposed to medical cost fluctuations. Our balanced portfolio and multiple levers for value creation resulted in Cigna 's overall revenue and earnings exceeding our third quarter expectations. This strong third-quarter performance, coupled with capital deployment activities, led to an increased outlook for full-year 2021, which I will discuss shortly. Now, turning to Enterprise results, key consolidated financial highlights in third quarter 2021 include adjusted revenue growth of 9% to $44.3 billion, adjusted earnings growth of 20% to $1.9 billion after tax, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 30% to $5.73.  Results in the third quarter reflects strong top and bottom-line growth with contributions across all of our businesses, with overall performance above our expectations. I will now discuss our segment level results, and will then provide an update on the details of our outlook, as well as our capital positioning. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Third quarter 2021 a adjusted revenues grew 13% to $33.6 billion. A adjusted pharmacy script volume increased 8% to 411 million scripts, and adjusted pretax earnings grew 7% to $1.5 billion compared to third quarter 2020.  Evernorth strong results in the quarter were driven by organic growth, including strong volumes in retail and specialty pharmacy, along with ongoing efforts to improve affordability for the benefit of our clients, customers, and patients. And deepening of existing relationships, partially offset by significant strategic investments to support ongoing growth, including our virtual care platform and technology capabilities. Overall, Evernorth continues to create differentiated value for clients and customers, while driving overall revenue and earnings growth that exceeded our original expectations through the first 3 quarters of 2021. Turning to U.S. Medical. Third quarter adjusted revenues were $10.5 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were approximately $1 billion. Overall, our U.S. Medical earnings exceeded our expectations during the third quarter, reflecting the impact of favorable net investment income and increased specialty contributions, partially offset by higher claim costs due to the net impact of COVID-19, and increased medical costs for special enrollment period customers in our individual business.  The net effect of these claim cost impacts produced a medical care ratio of 84.4% in the third quarter. Looking ahead, we are actively managing overall medical costs and our MCR with the range of actions. Including continuing to leverage our insights from our strong data and analytics capabilities to address key drivers and identify opportunities such as guiding customers to more effective and efficient sites of care.  Continued discipline in our pricing and rate actions, and we're also continuing to promote preventative care and access to behavioral services to provide meaningful support to patients, and moderate overall medical costs over the longer term. Turning to membership, we ended the quarter with 17 million total medical customers, an increase of approximately 368,000 customers year-to-date. In U.S. Medical, the year-to-date customer growth was driven by net growth in select and middle markets within U.S. commercial and continued organic growth in Medicare Advantage and individual within U.S. government. In our international markets business, third quarter adjusted revenues were $1.6 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $250 million.  These results were in line with our expectations. Corporate and other operations delivered a third quarter adjusted loss of $275 million. Overall, Cigna's broad portfolio of services continues to serve the needs of our customers and clients. Cigna remains committed to delivering value for all of our stakeholders, leveraging our well-positioned businesses. Now, turning to our updated outlook for full-year 2021. We are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance for full-year 2021 to at least $20.35 per share, reflecting the strength of the quarter, the favorable impact of our year-to-date share repurchase, and acknowledgment of the ongoing fluidity of the broader environment.  This represents EPS growth of at least 10% from 2020, consistent with our long-term EPS growth range of 10% to 13%, even with the ongoing challenges associated with COVID-19 and while having significantly increased our dividend in 2021. As we look forward, it is clear that COVID-19 will continue to have an impact in the fourth quarter and in 2022. And as time progresses, COVID related impacts and the ongoing performance of the business are becoming more intertwined. Therefore, we no longer believe it's instructive to continue to quantify the impact of COVID-19. These dynamics are fully contemplated in our 2021 expectation for adjusted EPS of at least $20.35 and our 2022 expectation for EPS growth of at least 10% off this 2021 guidance. Turning to revenue, we now expect full-year 2021 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $172 billion, representing growth of at least 11% from 2020, when adjusting for the divestiture of our group disability in Life business. I would note this revenue growth rate significantly exceeds our projected long-term average annual growth goal of 6% to 8% and represents the third consecutive year of significant revenue outperformance since our combination with Express Scripts in late 2018. I will now discuss our 2021 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we continue to expect full-year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $5.8 billion representing growth of at least 8% over 2020, reflecting the significant value we create for our customers and clients.  For U.S. Medical, we continue to expect full-year 2021, adjusted earnings of at least $3.5 billion. Underlying this updated outlook, we now expect the 2021 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84% to 84.5%, which includes our expectations for elevated medical costs for individual special enrollment period customers. Regarding total medical customers, we continue to expect 2021 growth of at least 350,000 customers. Now, moving to our 2021 capital management position and outlook.  We expect our businesses to continue to drive strong cash flows and returns on capital even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. For full-year 2021, we continue to expect at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well-performing businesses. Year-to-date as of November 3rd 2021, we have repurchased 26.5 million shares for $6.3 billion. And we now expect full-year 2021 weighted average shares of approximately 342 million shares. This includes the impact of the $2 billion accelerated share repurchase that we announced in the third quarter. On October 27th, we declared a $1 per share dividend payable on December 22nd to shareholders of record as of December 7th. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient, service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins, and attractive returns on capital.  So now to recap, results in the third quarter reflects strong top and bottom-line growth with solid contributions across our businesses. Cigna has shown the ability to deliver value through dynamic environments with our breadth of businesses and multiple earnings levers. We continue to support our customers, clients, and coworkers, and deliver on our financial commitments.  We now expect 2021 full-year adjusted earnings of at least $20.35 per share, representing growth of at least 10% from 2020, consistent with our long-term EPS growth rate range of 10% to 13%, and we expect to grow 2022 adjusted EPS, at least 10% off our raised 2021 guidance. With that, we'll turn it over to the Operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Also, if you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the buttons. Finally, we ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question to allow sufficient time for questions from those remaining in the queue. And one moment please, for the first question. Our first question comes from Mr. A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. You may ask your question. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hello, everybody. Just maybe to try to drill down a little bit on that expectation for at least 10% growth of the new updated numbers for this year. I know it sounds like you're getting away from talking about that $250 of net COVID impact you're absorbing this year and others various inputs there, but I was wondering, because their last quarter it sounded like you were carrying a lot of your expectation for COVID related costs broadly defined into next year. As you think about your updated thoughts about '22, can you comment on how much of ongoing COVID headwind are you expecting and is there any other big changes to the puts and takes you'd laid out last quarter as you think about '22? David Cordani : Hey A.J., good morning. It's David. Let me try to shape our insights relative to 2022, now that we're much deeper into 2021. First, you're right earlier this year, we've tried to frame the magnitude of the headwind and indisputably COVID had many disruptions to the marketplace, whether it's testing, treatment, revenue, dislocation, etc. Against that backdrop, as you know, our broad service portfolio and a broad funding mechanism continued to perform quite well, and we're able to deliver from a marketplace standpoint. If you think about 2021, there's really four big chunky items. One was up pulling the headwind category. The headwind created by the COVID cost and the headwind created by MRA revenue decrement. And then, positives offsetting that somewhat which were favorable net investment income and some operating expense items. Now as we think about and look at the 2022 environment, our visibility in terms of our growth outlook, our rate execution, our affordability initiatives, our efficiency initiatives, and our understanding of how this year is coming to close, broadly speaking, those puts and take in 2021 largely offset one another as we step into 2022, the headwinds and tailwinds. Our at least 10% growth in 2022 off of our elevated 2021 EPS, essentially represents capital deployment in line with our strategic target of 4% to 5% of accretion.  And the residual at least 5% to 6% from fundamental operating growth to get us to that at least 10%. To recap, additional visibility in terms of the drivers for 2022 growth -- mix of growth, rate execution affordability. And then secondly, the puts-and-takes in 2021 are configuring in a way that they've largely offset one and other as we step into 2022, underscoring that at least 10% is largely fundamental for our business portfolio. A.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Ms. Lisa Gill with JP Morgan. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much, and good morning. David, I just wanted to better understand how you're thinking about the Ever-north business as we think about 2022? I know you've talked in the past about some of the business losses, but if you can give us an update as to how to think about Ever north going into 2022, and then as we think about the Ever-north business and think about the virtual primary care offerings that are out in the marketplace, what are you thinking with MDLIVE? David Cordani : Good morning, Lisa. So relative to Ever north, first as we step into 2022, as Brian and I both noted, we're quite pleased with the underlying performance of Ever north. If you look at the inherent growth that ever north has delivered for the organization, and the diversity of the growth, we're quite pleased with that.  Secondly, our ability to both drive fundamental growth because you'd invest in innovation and extend our partnerships, we feel quite good. So just framing Ever north and then coming to the MDLIVE question, our Ever north portfolio has 4 specific portfolios of services that are positioned well : Evernorth pharmacy, Evernorth care, Evernorth Benefits, and Evernorth intelligence. Our positioning growth at the serving health plans, large employers, expanding with governmental agencies, and increasingly with healthcare providers continues to resonate well in the marketplace.  For 2022, to your comment relative to some losses, we expect to retention rate in the Evernorth pharmacy business in the mid-90s, which is still a strong result even with the known losses we'd identified. And given the strength we've had of growth over the last several years, we're quite committed to maintaining price discipline in the marketplace, so the business portfolio will grow yet again. Specific to MDLIVE, we're delighted to have the MDLIVE capabilities in our portfolio and that now resides within Evernorth care.  We see the utilization of those services continue to grow. As I noted, beyond important, urgent or Triage care. But two primary behavioral dermatology. And then we've recently expanded our virtual-first offering. So, we see it as a great opportunity to both expand access, improve affordability. But finally, it presents a platform to broaden some access to care in terms of alternative side of care capabilities. So, in a nutshell, we're pleased, we'll grow again and we're investing in further growth, including within the virtual capabilities of MDLIVE. Lisa Gill : Great, thanks for the comments. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Gill. Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask David about the international sale. First, in terms of multiple, it looks like you've got about 10 to 12 times kind of net income for that business. Is that correct? In the right ballpark? And then if so, just curious in terms of the strategic nature of the sale in terms of -- the multiple looks depressed relative to a business that's historically been looked at as a double-digit top-line grower. And then could you tell us how we should think about capital deployment once you get those funds? Is it going to be similar to what we saw with the Life and Disability, where there's a lot of share repo or should we think about something else? Thanks. David Cordani : Sure. Good morning, Justin. Let me start and have Brian shape a little further both how we feel about the value realization here in the capital deployment. First, stepping back, we're quite proud of what has been built in our international portfolio over a long period of time. This specific portion of our international portfolio, so direct to individual life, accident and supplemental businesses, we've successfully grown over a long period of time. But using our strategy as a guide, the important underscore here, our strategy guides us to further enhance and deepen our health and well-being solutions.  This portion of our portfolio was less directly aligned over time to that. So, we use the strategy as a guide number 1. 2, we feel very good about the value realization, and the net value realization area is quite important in terms of a high-performing asset. And I appreciate your correlation to the group transaction, another high-performing asset where we felt quite good about using our strategy as a guide and capitalizing on a very attractive valuation.  And then finally, that strategic action is done to allow us to even further intensify our focus in the sub segments of the business that are more health and well-being oriented, both in the U.S. as well as globally from that standpoint as we'll continue to grow. I'll ask Brian to speak a little bit more towards how we look at the valuation and our capital deployment philosophy going forward. Brian Evanko : Yeah, sure, David. And good morning, Justin. The math that you asked about in terms of the 10 times to 12 times multiple is in the right ballpark if you're looking at U.S. GAAP earnings contributions from the divested businesses, but very importantly, this is a case where economics and accounting don't necessarily square up. If you look at the discounted cash flows of the business here and the purchase price that we were able to get, it's quite an attractive deal economically that we're quite pleased with the financial terms for that reason, as you look at the timing of when dividends were available to be extracted, as an example.  In terms of deployment with the proceeds, the the broad template as, David made reference to of our group disability and life divestiture, is what we would expect to fall in this instance as well, with the exception of we don't have the same need for long-term debt repayment as we did with the group disability and life transactions. So, we would expect the primary use to be for share repurchase. And when we indicated in the press release that this would be neutral to slightly diluted to our 2022 EPS outlook. That's under the assumption that the primary use is for share repurchase. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Ms. Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Michael Hall : Hey guys, this is Michael Hall on for Ricky. Thanks for the question. So, as it relates to 2022 commercial growth, a number of your peers have already mentioned expecting strong growth. They diffuse concerns around member attrition, and the dynamic, and emphasize share gains, I think one of your peers even mentioned '22 shaping up to be one of the strongest national account selling seasons in history. So, with that said, it's been a bright area, but also hard to imagine that everyone is winning contracts and gaining share. So, with that context, what are you guys seeing with the competitive landscape? And are you able to grow next year when everyone else comes in taking share? David Cordani : Mike, good morning. It's David. Just a minute of backdrop relative to our performance in the commercial market and then I'll jump right into '22. We have a very focused strategy and a long track record over the last decade of successfully growing in the commercial marketplace. As we seek the sub-segment and deliver the right solutions for our respective clients in that marketplace. And if you think about it over the last decade - ish, we've generally grown low-single-digit medical membership. We couple that with significant and targeted cross-selling of our new and innovative services.  And then we complement that with appropriate pricing actions and the net of that yields higher single-digit revenue growth. So that's the big picture of our strategic approach. I'd also highlight with Evernorth, we are further expanding the services that we're able to bring through to deepen relationships, like our prior conversation relative to virtual care as an example. Now, specific to 2022, to be clear, we'll grow again. We will clearly grow our medical customer base again, and specifically, within the commercial market, we have good visibility in terms of having net growth in our national accounts in large account business portfolio, and we'll have another year of growth within our select segment.  So, the net of all that, in a marketplace that is competitive, as we are oriented around solutions that have affordability and high engagement programs with the right funding mechanisms, we will again have another year of net growth in the U.S. commercial portfolio, and it's something we're quite proud of and positioned to continue on. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. It sounds like in the quarter you mentioned, you've benefited from investment income and specialty outperformance. I guess, two things. So, do you believe that the specialty outperformance is something that is going to be sustainable? And then if you could just talk a little bit more about the competitive landscape for commercial pricing for next year, do you think that you're going to be within your target range? Or I guess maybe where your target range is expected to be in the commercial business for next year. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Kevin, it's Brian. I'll start on the first piece of your question. I think this was in the context of our U.S. Medical performance in terms of your question on specialty. So, as you reflect on our third quarter performance for that segment, again, the earnings in totality were above our expectations in the quarter. We had two areas of favorability, as you called out, investment income, and specialty contributions. And your specialty contributions includes pharmacy, behavioral, dental, the full suite of portfolio capabilities we have in the specialty domain.  That was partly offset by the two sources of claims pressure that I articulated in the COVID related pressure in commercial as well as the special enrollment period. MCR is now in elevated in the Individual exchange. Specifically on the favorability that we recorded in the third quarter. The investment income is non-recurring, so you should not consider that to be something that would occur again in the fourth quarter or '22.  We would expect the specialty contributions to persist as favorability as we head into fourth quarter and into '22. That was a smaller component of the 2 in terms of the favorable items in the third quarter, but that is something we would expect to continue to persist going forward. David maybe will comment on the pricing environment for commercial. David Cordani : Sure. Good morning, Kevin. Relative to the pricing environment for commercial, and I'm going to maybe sneak in a little bit on the individual marketplace here as well. But specifically, that market has continued to be a competitive market, and it remains that meaning the commercial marketplace, more broadly, the employer commercial market. And with that as a backdrop into my prior answer, we will grow our commercial book of business and we will improve our MCR. Our visibility has us both growing and improving our MCR within the commercial book of business.  So, to do that, we will be quite disciplined, Kevin, to be clear, and we're willing to make targeted trade-offs for MCR or margin versus volume. And the net of that will yield net customer growth and net margin improvement as we step into 2022. An add-on specifically in the individual market -- our visibility in the individual market is that there are significant pockets of competitiveness in certain markets. And as such in the Individual marketplace, we would expect for 2022 to see no growth or more likely negative growth, some shrinkage in our book of business, but improvement in the MCR within that portfolio. And that's fully contemplated in our 2022 outlook of net growth for the portfolio, as well as earnings expansion. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Mr. Gary Taylor with Cowen. You may ask your question. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. Just wanted to go back to the MCR comments and appreciate what you just said, David, but just wanted to think a little bit more about 2021 so far. So, as we kind of look at the potential impact of special enrollment period enrollees based on your typical attrition. It doesn't look like that's particularly material to the increase in MCR versus 2019 baseline, which is up about 400 basis points in the 3Q when you had a lot of COVID costs, but it was up almost 400 basis points in the 2Q when you didn't have a lot of COVID costs and you had more deferred care coming back.  So, I guess the question is, is there any other substantial moving parts to how you're running versus the 2019 baseline, and then just going forward, what are your -- what do you anticipate as COVID and the Delta variant comes down? Do you feel like commercial utilization is largely caught up or we're sort of still back in a cycle, like you were in the 2Q where you see some of the deferred care increasing? Brian Evanko : Morning, Gary. It's Brian. So, I'll try to take the various components of that question here. So, as you think about where we are running in 2021 on the MCR, maybe I'll talk in terms of the full-year guide. I think that that's probably the most constructive way to pull it apart. the 84% to 84.5% refresh guidance that we issued. If the special enrollment period lives within the individual exchange portfolio had not grown to the level that they are, and had not had the elevated MCR that they did in the quarter, we would've had an MCR performance for the full-year that was more like the higher end of our prior guidance range, so towards the higher end of the 83% to 84% range, if you exclude the impact of the Individual SCP customers from the full-year outlook.  So just to give you a little bit of dimensioning as to the materiality there. Those customer lives have built up over the course of the year, so there were not that many in the second quarter, there were many more in the third quarter. And the elevated MCR hit us, particularly, significantly in the third quarter and we expect that pressure to continue into the fourth quarter. As David did reference to in a prior question, we would expect that to dissipate into 2022 as many of those lives attrit into our choose new carriers.  As it relates to other parts of the portfolio. The commercial business in the third quarter, we had some elevated COVID related costs, particularly in August and September, with the Delta variant hitting younger ages more significantly than earlier in the pandemic. So that created some elevated commercial claim cost pressure in the third quarter. I would note in our Medicare Advantage book, the MCR in the quarter was a little bit favorable to our expectations, which gives us greater confidence here as we head into 2022 on that subset of the overall U.S. Medical book of business.  Hopefully it gives you a little bit of a picture for how 2021 is shaping up. In terms of your question, looking forward on commercial utilization, are we caught up, etc. we have seen much less deferred care in the commercial line of business throughout the pandemic, and all the indicators that we track, whether that be preventive care utilization or whether that be rates of new cancer diagnoses, etc. I would tell you that there's not a significant amount of future pent-up demand or catch-up care to come. With that said, our pricing posture, as David mentioned earlier continues to be a prioritization of margin expansion as we head into 2022. Gary Taylor : Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Taylor. And next question comes from Mr. Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. You may ask your question. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning. I guess I want to go back -- you guys specifically called out the increased specialty contributions, and obviously that's always been part of the story. So hoping you can give more details there, what the specific drivers are there, and anything to call out. And then maybe within that, I was hoping you could talk about the stop loss product. I would have imagined that just given higher commercial trend that maybe more of that is being triggered and maybe some underperformance there. But we just like to get your commentary on how that's performed and how we should think about that for 2022 from a re-pricing perspective. Thanks. David Cordani : Morning, Ralph, it's David. Just a couple of minutes on the shaping and I'll hand it over to Brian. As you articulate the specialty components, so we look at that broadly back to our strategy. Our strategy has been and continues to be how do we wrap the right suite of solutions, employer by employer, to help to get the overall health and wellbeing offering aligned in the overall affordability line. And historically, one thinks about a specialty suite of a few products of behavioral pharmacy, Dental has expanded tremendously to 25, 30 different services when you take the subsegments of decision, support, chronic care management, specialty services, now virtual alternative services, etc.  My point of underscoring this has been as you articulated and continues to be a really important part of our strategy to try to get the right value to be realized for our for our clients, our customers, and our patients. And as I noted, our Evernorth service capabilities continue to grow, which add to the portfolio of services to be levered there. I will ask Brian to talk a little bit more in terms of the drivers. Brian Evanko : Sure, David. Good morning, Ralph. So in terms of the specialty contributions we called out they're the couple of areas I'd particularly point to as more material within our self-funded business, we had some strength in pharmacy in particular, and as I mentioned earlier, to a prior question, we would expect that to persist as we head into 2022. We also saw some upside within our behavioral health offerings as demand for that has continued to grow throughout the pandemic. So we saw some increased uptake there, which drove some additional margin for us within the quarter. And again, those are two areas we would expect to persist as we head into the new year. Relative to stop loss, obviously you gotta pull this one apart further because you got Individual stop loss cover as well as aggregate stop loss cover, and the dynamics there behaved a little bit differently throughout the pandemic, meaning most COVID related claimants didn't actually hit our Individual stop-loss thresholds. Yet we saw a little bit of pressure earlier in the pandemic on our aggregate stop loss business.  That business gets repriced along with our typical 12-month contract cycles for all the clients that we have. So we feel good about how we positioned there on a prospective basis. I'd also note we're seeing good demand for that product. You probably saw on the supplement there, we had 7% premium growth on our stop loss line in the quarter-over-quarter. So, feeling good about all the specialty solutions when you look at the total portfolio. Ralph Giacobbe : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. Our next question comes from Mr. Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Appreciate you guys taking the question. So the MLR, I know you guys, only disclose one sort of big MLR for the U.S. Medical segments. I was wondering if you could break out or give a little bit more color even if it just directional on the MLR 's for sort of commercial and then, government and maybe, even within government, how much was from the IFP versus Medicare Advantage? And then just a quick follow-up on stop-loss, what are the attachment points at the individual claim level typically? I know there's a range of those, but kind of maybe what's the most common thresholds than an individual has to hit? Brian Evanko : Good morning, Josh. So I'll try not to be too redundant with some of my prior comments, but just to kind of summarize a few important points here as you pull apart the MLR for the full year, as I mentioned earlier, the refresh 84% to 84.5% outlook reflects particular pressure from the Individual exchange lives and specifically the special enrollment period enrollees. So removing that, we would have been toward the higher end of our prior guide of 83% to 84%, but a sub bullet there is the individual open enrollment lives are actually performing pretty well.  So when we look at the profitability of the overall individual portfolio, we have good performance on the standard open enrollment lives. We have poor performance on the special enrollment period lives and the total picture there is therefore a bit elevated. Medicare Advantage as I made reference to actually ran a little bit favorable to our expectations in the third quarter. And then commercial was a touch higher than our projections due to the effect of the Delta variant in the months of August and September in particular.  So those are the broad buckets that I paint for you, do you think about what's inside the medical care ratio. Relative to stop loss, we do have a range of attachment points depending on the client. So we tend to see particular popularity around the $15,000 to $75,000 level, but it really depends on the risk appetite for a given client. So it's hard to say that there's one that's always the preferred choice. We have a distribution and the distribution evolves depending on the appetite for clients at any given point in time. Josh Raskin : Perfect. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Caliendo with UBS. You may ask your question. James Stewart : Hi, this is James Stewart on for Kevin. Just maybe with the sale of Chubb, you're signaling more of a focus to core healthcare business. Are there any other segments within the Company that you consider a non-core that you might be looking to dispose off in the future? David Cordani : Good morning. It's David. As you noted, the action we took relative to that part of our portfolio and previously the action we took relative to our group insurance business, we deem to be a good fiduciary management of the portfolio and looking at the strategy as a guide to our actions, headline is I would not signal anything of materiality that sits on the horizon. I would reinforce, it's a dynamic process. Our responsibility is to dynamically manage that. But I would not signal anything on the horizon. I'm quite proud of the organization and pleased with the successful execution of both transactions : one completed, second under regulatory review right now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Steve Valiquette with Barclays. You may ask your question. Steve Valiquette : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just a question that maybe tie as a lot of the other discussion points together. For the preliminary view of '22, I know it's early, but just thinking about the framework of '22 relative to some of your long-term targets that you laid out the analyst meeting. I'm curious -- so for U.S. Medical, you just talked about growth next year, but the long-term guidance range is 8% to 11% earnings growth in that segment, 4% to 6% for Evernorth, and the rest from capital deployment.  But should we think about -- is that still the usable framework going into '22, or should we think about maybe less operational growth, and maybe more from capital deployment. Just any additional thoughts around those components might help knowing that its preliminary right now. David Cordani : Sure. Good morning, it's David. Big picture as you look to 2022, brief reference to this previously, but our view of the earnings visibility and the growth visibility relative to 2022 essentially, if you take the -- at least 10%, we underscore that with capital contribution to our EPS growth in line with our strategic target, which is 4 to 5. Then if you back away from that, that leaves you 5 to 6 fundamental organic earnings growth contribution to get to the at least 10% number. And we think that's an appropriate and prudent and attractive outlook given the fluidity and dynamism of the marketplace. Broadly speaking, both components are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and we have a track record including 2021, which is a disrupted year of delivering in line with that. Good fundamentals, a little more than 50% of it being organic, a little less than 50% of it being capital deployment, and very much in line with our long-term strategic targets. Steve Valiquette : Got it. Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our next question comes from Mr. Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Matthew Borsch : Yes. Thank you. Just wanted to ask what you're seeing in terms of customer preferences and actions in the middle market, particular degree of interest in alternate ASO type funding for the products versus what you've seen over the last few years. And then maybe in the stop loss market associated with that. Am I correct that some of the other carriers may be correcting for what was perhaps overly aggressive pricing in earlier years, which is maybe giving you a little bit of a tailwind there on your own growth? David Cordani : Matthew, good morning, It's David. So you referenced middle market. I don't think there's a singular common definition middle markets, so let me try to frame your important comment. First, as you look at our go-to market offerings, we have a broad suite of funding alternatives and we seek to offer to our clients their respective decision of how they want to finance the purchase after the benefits are configured, after the access profile is configured, after the clinical programs are configured, and the service models are configured to align as Brian referenced before, the risk transfer in the balance relative to them, so having that broad suite is really important.  If we look at the select segment, 100 to 500 live clients, it varies from year-to-year in terms of how much of the client demand is guaranteed cost versus self-funded with stop-loss, but self-funded with stop-loss has been a meaningful portion. And as you walk from that into the heart of what I might consider middle-market, the further you walk up an average size, on average, more demand for self-funded, less demand for risk transfer. And in the in between range, some for shared returns of a fundamentals that exist. So a little bit of linearity as you just go off in respect to size from that standpoint, but the important part is choice that we offer in the marketplace and try to separate the financing decisions. from the design features from the program. I would say to the last part of your question, I do not believe that there's a boomerang or reconfiguration effect that happened that we've benefited from a stop-loss standpoint. We've seen just consistency in how we use stop loss.  And I'm remind ed from prior conversations, we have a large book, we have a dedicated team that manages that book because it needs to be specialization in that like many other aspects of our business. And it's both performed for clients, importantly, giving them the peace of mind and revenue predictability and expense predictability they need, as well as for us over a long period of time. But I would not call out anything unique in terms of ebbing and flowing that's changed our rate of growth in stop loss over the recent past. Matthew Borsch : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Our next question comes from Mr. George Hill with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. George Hill : Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. David and Brian, just a couple of being counting ones and a quick question. David, I just want to make sure that 2035 or whatever the number is post Q4 is the right jumping off point for the 10% or better growth in 2022, given it sounds like you're saying all the other pushes and pulls are on mute now, can you quantify PBM to commercial medical cross-sales this selling season? And I'll pause right there. David Cordani : So George Hill it's two questions I heard. Question 1, yes. The at least $20.35, which is our raised EPS is the appropriate jump off to attach the at least 10% growth. We're pleased to have that underlying strength in that clarity of message. The second question, I think you're asking relative to PBM, commercial cross-sell penetration, etc. In respective growth, I don't have an Individual number for you. We have not historically walk-through individual numbers there. I'd ask you to step back and remember our strategy here. We have a high cross-sell and high integrated offering within our medical business. As you think within the prior question that Matthew asked, as you go to our select segment, think about that as 100% integrated. It is so integral to our offering, and as you move upmarket, it's more of a standalone sale that needs to be made. We see continued progress there, and we're pleased to either have it as an integrated part of our medical offering or a standalone PBM offering that we could harness and sell additional services because at the end of the day, as I called up my prepared remarks, there were 2 fundamental ways in which a client or customer establishes their primary health and wellbeing relationship.  Either a pharmacy relationship or largely off of a medical relationship. and we're positioned to lever both. So I would leave you with a directional answer on the PBM commercial. Brian referenced PBM strength over pharmacy strength in our commercial portfolio. That's a net positive. And we continue to see on traction both on standalone pharmacy as well as integrated pharmacy within our business. George Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Hill. Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question. Stephen Baxter : Hi, thanks. Just wanted to come back to the individual market commentary you made. Appreciate that you're pricing, I guess conservatively in a fairly competitive backdrop. How much of the way back towards your target margins do you think that's going to get you in 2022? And then how should we think about growth beyond 2022 as you previously have talked about, doubling this market through 2025? Thanks. David Cordani : Good morning, Stephen. We were seeking to be quite clear in terms of -- there's argue -- indisputably, there's some pockets of intense competitive pricing in the IFP marketplace or the Individual exchange marketplace as it's probably articulated. Given the breadth of our portfolio, we're going to be able to achieve both our aggregate growth as well as our aggregate earnings objectives, while maintaining price discipline in temporarily dislocated markets, and we deem that to be 1.  So we expect to see a net flat or decrement in our volumes in the Individual exchange business and a margin improvement. I'm not going to give you a margin number. We're not guiding in detail for 2022 yet and we typically don't guide relative to individual margins. Having said that, we expect to improve that margin from 2021 to 2022, to a more attractive and more sustainable level and we'll maintain the discipline there. As it relates to intermediate to long term, we continue to see this as a growth market. But as we've managed it and if we demonstrate it over time, if there were temporary dislocations, we'll maintain discipline, and will lever other parts of the business to ensure the portfolio delivers. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we've entered 3 more states and almost 100 additional counties, to give us access to an addressable market of approximately 1.5 million additional customers to sell to.  And we've been in this marketplace since its inception in 2014. And we have a track record of sustained performance, albeit episodically needing to sharpen focus as we will in 2022, given the market conditions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Baxter. Our next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question. David Windley : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. David, I'm interested in your views, albeit early, on this Build Back Better bill that appears to be moving toward a vote, and maybe specifically, what you think the impact of government negotiation on a top 10 or 20 drugs beyond our exclusivity would have on your PBM business? David Cordani : Good morning, Dave. So clearly a lot of fluidity right now on the health and we've operated for a long period of time in an environment and we'll continue to that has an active both legislative and regulatory agenda. So we understand that fully. Big picture stepping back, any initiatives that are constructive and sustainable, that improve affordability and value for individuals, we're actively open to engaged in and generally supportive of.  Specifically in the pharmacy space where you double-click down on. We think the most meaningful way to test sustainable policies -- policy change that could further affordability is to stimulate and further accelerate more competition. And if a heart come back as an example to make it tangible, hepatitis C was, I think, a very positive example that reinforces that. But as the marketplace rapidly move from 1 to 2 suppliers for hepatitis C services, which was a breakthrough drug that society benefits from, the overall affordability changed dramatically.  That's an action that is different than who's negotiating or it's very different than putting in artificial cap on a rate of growth from that standpoint. Big picture, we will await specific details and we will remain actively engaged, no doubt. We believe the most sustainable way to further improve affordability, is to expand choice and expand competition.  That's what's worked in the marketplace in the model. And lastly, per prior conversation we've had our well-performing and broad portfolio pharmacy services and tools is well-positioned to be able to deliver value in a changing environment, and we're confident in the capabilities we have over the strategic horizon here. David Windley : Great, thanks for your thoughts. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Windley. Our last question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. You may ask your question. Lance Wilkes : Could you just give a little more color on Evernorth pharmacy and what I was particularly interested in is, from a vaccine standpoint in the quarter, how much of that impact volumes and margin? And then are you seeing much impact to margin from specialty pharmacy going generic, whether that's the beginning or your outlook for that? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Lance. It's Brian. So within the third quarter in Evernorth, we fulfilled about 4 million COVID vaccine prescriptions. So to put that into context, that's about 1% of our total script volume, and year-to-date, we're up to about 16 million across the three quarters here in 2021. So again, roughly about 1% of total script volumes for Evernorth, but not a material contribution from an income standpoint.  And if that number goes up or down next year, it won't materially move the needle for the Evernorth segment. More broadly on the second part of your question, as we think about specialty generics, and you can even broaden that to include biosimilars. We're really excited about those for the future from the standpoint of driving affordability on behalf of our clients and customers. We think competition is a good thing and ultimately, Specialty Generics.  While the timing with which they're introduced is hard to predict and does create some variability in our quarterly income patterns. Ultimately, we view that as a great thing for our clients, customers, and ultimately for our business. And fortunately, we have a wide range of earnings levers that allow us to capture value in a variety of ways depending on how different client contracts are constructed. We're really excited about especially generics and biosimilars going forward. Lance Wilkes : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Wilkes. I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : Just to briefly wrap up our call. I do want to underscore how proud and appreciative I am of our more than 70,000 co-workers around the globe who continue to be dedicated to the many stakeholders we serve.

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter the queue to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, in this conference, including the question-and-answer session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead, Mr. Giacobbe. Ralph Giacobbe : Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, Cigna's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's Fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results as well as our financial outlook for 2022. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2022 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note of today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. First, as previously disclosed with our Form 8-K filing and investor call on January 24, we announced changes in our segment reporting effective for the fourth quarter of 2021. These changes were made to align with the company's organizational structure as a result of the pending divestiture of Cigna's International life accident and supplemental benefits businesses in seven Asia Pacific markets. Effective in the fourth quarter, Cigna's results will be reported through the following three groups : Evernorth, Cigna Healthcare and Corporate and Other Operations. The international businesses that will be divested pending the close of the transaction will now be reported in Other Operations, which is included within Corporate and Other Operations in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. The International Health business to be retained by Cigna will join our U.S. commercial and U.S. government offerings in a new segment called Cigna Healthcare. This segment replaces the prior U.S. Medical segment. Second, regarding our results. In the fourth quarter, we recorded an after-tax special item charge of $119 million or $0.36 per share related to a strategic plan to further leverage the company's ongoing growth to drive operational efficiency through enhancements to organizational structure and increased use of automation and shared services. We also recorded an after-tax special item charge of $70 million or $0.21 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2022 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2022 dividends. Also, our full year 2022 outlook assumes that the pending divestiture of Cigna's International life accident and supplemental benefits businesses will close in the second quarter of 2022, but does not assume any impact from other business combinations or divestitures that may occur after today. Finally, I would like to announce our intention to host an Investor Day in June where we will discuss our long-term strategic growth and value creation story. We look forward to sharing more details in the coming weeks. With that, I will turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. As we step into 2022, our clients, customers and patients continue to face a rapidly changing landscape with new COVID variants, changing testing and treatment protocols and pressures on the global economy. Throughout these challenges, we have remained focused on addressing and balancing the evolving needs of all of our stakeholders. As a result, our 70,000-plus colleagues around the world continue to deliver differentiated value for those we serve and also continue to grow our businesses. Today, I'll share a perspective around our 2021 performance and the sustained growth opportunities we see for our organization in the year ahead. And Brian will provide additional details about our 2021 financial results and our 2022 outlook. Then we'll take your questions. With that, let's get started. In 2021, we grew full year adjusted revenues to $174 billion, a second consecutive year of growth above our long-term target. We delivered full year adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% and to $20.47, and we returned over $9 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, we continue to invest in our capabilities to ensure we are positioned for sustained growth in 2022 and beyond. Our growth is and will continue to be fueled by our two high- performing platforms : Evernorth, our health services business, including pharmacy, care, benefits and intelligence services; and Cigna Healthcare, which includes our portfolio of U.S. commercial, U.S. Government and International Health businesses. Our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms complement each other through the breadth of their capabilities and the ability to serve multiple buyer groups. Here, we typically lead with either a medical or pharmacy solution and then we build on those relationships by innovating and delivering new services. We have a proven track record with this approach, a diverse, high-performing portfolio of solutions and a sustained commitment to continued innovation to expand that portfolio. Additionally, we are positioned so that accelerated growth in one area can compensate for temporary pressure in another business within our portfolio. We see this as extremely valuable in a dynamic environment. Relative to our 2021 performance, it was a very strong year for Evernorth. We grew adjusted revenues by 14% in 2021 as Evernorth's corporate clients, health plans, governmental agencies and healthcare delivery system partners increasingly recognized the value of our health services, including in our specialty pharmacy business, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a moment, in our virtual health capabilities, which have been expanded through MDLIVE to include urgent and dermatology care as well as behavioral health services; in our core pharmacy services portfolio, which continues to generate outstanding results for our clients; and we are further broadening our reach through deeper and new partnerships. For Cigna Healthcare, we had sustained growth, leveraging the strength of our U.S. Commercial, U.S. Government and International Health businesses. As we previously discussed, we also experienced elevated medical costs. We had higher claims costs in our commercial insured and stop-loss businesses and continued higher claims from our special enrollment period customers within the individual business. These included the impact of elevated COVID costs for testing treatment of vaccines. The elevated trend continued throughout the year. As a result, our medical care ratio for Cigna Healthcare was 84% for full year 2021. As Brian will discuss in further detail, we took targeted pricing and affordability actions earlier in 2021 for 2022 impact, as we continue to prioritize margin expansion for 2022. As I highlighted earlier, the breadth and complementary nature of our portfolio enabled us to exceed our revenue and EPS outlook and return over $9 billion of capital to our shareholders. Looking forward to 2022, we expect to continue to capitalize on emerging growth opportunities and achieve sustained attractive performance. We see additional opportunities to drive growth by leveraging Evernorth capabilities to respond to three forces that we believe are fundamentally reshaping the future of healthcare. They are pharmacological innovation, the increased recognition of the link between mental and physical health; and third, the growing trend toward alternative sites of care. I'll start by highlighting how Evernorth will lead the way to capitalize on the first trend, pharmacological innovation. New drugs represent one of the most promising areas for medical innovation in the coming years. And we're seeing good dramatic growth in specialty pharmaceuticals, gene therapies and vaccines. These potentially life-saving and life-changing advances also bring intensifying pressures on affordability. This creates significant opportunity for Evernorth to provide customers, patients and clients with the most innovative new therapies in ways that are accessible, affordable and predictable. By 2025, for example, 66 biologic drugs currently in the market will have the patents expire, opening the door for increased biosimilar competition and an increasing opportunity to decrease healthcare spending by an estimated $100 billion. Importantly, this trend is already unfolding in 2022 and will accelerate further in 2023. We are positioned to lead and fully intend to capture a large portion of those savings for the benefit of our customers, patients and clients by combining and coordinating capabilities that include our Accredo capability, which provides differentiated specialty pharmacy care for a number of specific conditions. I'd also highlight that today specialty pharmacy already drives only 1/3 of our Evernorth revenue, and Accredo is one of the fastest-growing parts of our health service portfolio. Additionally, leveraging Express Scripts, which draws upon its expertise in delivering improved affordability, leveraging a broad network, supply chain expertise as well as clinical and service capabilities. Managing biologics and specialty drugs is also a priority focus for our Cigna Healthcare business. Last year, we launched an innovative program to leverage biosimilars in the medical benefit that included incentives that improve access for integrated clients and customers. This illustrates just one way we will continue to leverage Evernorth's capabilities to drive greater affordability and value for Cigna Healthcare clients and customers. Evernorth will also continue to grow from the significant demand for more mental health services as well as the rapidly changing access to care models. For example, Evernorth is continuing to expand our virtual care services by leveraging our MDLIVE platform as well as expanding our behavioral care network. We know how important it is for both patients as well as clients. Our Evernorth research reinforces that total healthcare costs decrease when people, who are diagnosed with behavioral conditions receive coordinated, sustained treatment. For Cigna Healthcare in 2022, we expect to drive customer growth in each of our U.S. commercial market segments and grow earnings as we continue executing on our affordability and pricing actions throughout 2022. Additionally, Cigna Healthcare will continue to partner and leverage our Evernorth innovations. For example, we're continuing to expand digital experiences to help our customers connect with the highest performing and most affordable medical care. Our recent approach, we developed for patients diagnosed with orthopedic and musculoskeletal conditions provide highly personalized and actionable information to guide their choices and support improved healthcare outcomes and affordability. In our U.S. government business, as we've noted previously, we are operating in a more competitive environment stepping into 2022. For Cigna, aided by the strength of our broad portfolio, we've prioritized pricing discipline for U.S. government business for 2022. For Medicare Advantage, we will start the year with flat membership. Looking forward to 2023, we are confident in our position to accelerate growth further, as our customer satisfaction metrics are high, our Star's ratings are very strong, and we steadily expanded our addressable market by entering new geographies. In our Individual & Family Plan business, as noted previously, 2021 customers grew meaningfully in part due to the extended special enrollment period. We expect a decline in customers in 2022, in part driven by our product and price positioning that will adjust for the special enrollment surge we saw in 2021. We do continue to view this as an attractive long-term opportunity. And to support that growth, we continue to enter new markets. For 2022, we entered three new states and 93 new counties. With these markets, for example, we have the ability to reach an additional 1.5 million additional customers. In International Health, we are sharpening our focus, and we'll continue developing our services for the globally mobile as well as go deeper into domestic health and health services. One of the key ways we will do this is with innovative partnerships such as Honeysuckle Health, an analytics-driven health service company establishing our joint venture with the nib Group in Australia. Now taken as a whole, 2022 will be another year of attractive growth for our company. our EPS outlook of at least $22.40 and the increase of our quarterly dividend by 12% reinforces the sustained growth and strength of our businesses. Now before I wrap up, I want to reinforce a key aspect of our sustained performance is our positioning strategically to further expand our reach in addressable markets over time. Here, we will leverage organic partnerships and targeted inorganic opportunities to further strengthen our proven growth platforms. We see three areas of continued focus here. First, in U.S. government, we will seek additional growth opportunities and our ability to win in these markets is further enhanced by our current and expanding Evernorth service capabilities. Second, we will further expand our Evernorth service portfolio. This includes, for example, our Evernorth Care capabilities, including virtual, home and behavioral services. And third, in International Health, our decision to divest our Life accident and supplemental benefits business in several markets reinforces our discipline to focus on the health portion of our portfolio. Now to wrap up. Looking back at 2021, our business performed in a dynamic environment. We delivered adjusted EPS of $20.47 and returned over $9 billion of capital to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchase. 2022 will be another year of growth across our business, and we will continue to invest in innovation to position us for sustained long-term growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Evanko : Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's fourth quarter 2021 results, and I'll provide our outlook for 2022. Key consolidated financial highlights for full year 2021 include adjusted revenue growth of 9% to $174 billion or growth of 12% when adjusting for the sale of the Group Disability and Life business. Adjusted earnings of $7 billion after-tax and adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% to $20.47. We delivered these results despite an elevated medical care ratio in the quarter, partly driven by COVID-19-related claims. Our enterprise revenue and EPS results were slightly better than our expectations, reflecting the resilience and breadth of our portfolio, with particularly strong performance in Evernorth. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Fourth quarter 2021 adjusted revenues grew 15% to $35.1 billion, while adjusted pretax earnings grew to $1.6 billion. Evernorth's strong results in the quarter were driven by organic growth, including strong volumes in specialty pharmacy and retail, along with ongoing efforts to improve affordability and deepening of existing relationships. In the quarter, we also continued to increase the level of strategic investments to support ongoing growth of the Evernorth portfolio, such as our Accredo specialty pharmacy, our virtual care platform and our technology, including digital capabilities. Overall, Evernorth delivered a strong year, focusing on driving value for clients and customers, while achieving strong revenue and earnings growth above its long-term growth targets. Turning to Cigna Healthcare, which, as a reminder, now includes the prior U.S. Medical segment plus our retained International Health business. Overall, fourth quarter adjusted revenues were $11.2 billion, adjusted pretax earnings were $472 million and the medical care ratio was 87%. During the fourth quarter, we experienced elevated medical costs, driven in large part by dynamics related to COVID, including higher testing, treatment and vaccine costs, specifically the higher-than-expected fourth quarter costs are attributable to three primary areas : higher stop-loss claims, particularly in policies with lower attachment points that were triggered by the cumulative impact of COVID and non-COVID costs throughout the year. Continued pressure on our individual business, particularly the special enrollment period customers who were added in mid-2021 and higher claim costs in our commercial insured book. The elevated medical costs were partly offset by better-than-expected net investment income and fee-based specialty contributions, neither of which are reflected in the medical care ratio metric. For full year 2021, we finished with the medical care ratio of 84%. The unfavorable fourth quarter medical costs informed and sharpened our 2022 assumptions. We now expect full year 2022 medical costs to run above the corresponding 2022 baseline at a relative level that is consistent with full year 2021. This 2022 medical cost outlook is now higher than our previous expectations. In specific to stop-loss, we assume the pressure experienced in the fourth quarter will persist in 2022, and we will take appropriate future pricing action as this book of business renews throughout the year. Helping to offset these pressures, as we step into 2022, our targeted pricing actions we've taken in our U.S. Commercial business as we saw claim costs emerge in 2021, higher U.S. commercial enrollment and retention than previously expected in our fee-based business and incremental affordability actions, which I'll elaborate on in just a few moments. Turning to membership; we ended the year with 17.1 million total medical customers, an increase of approximately 430,000 customers for the full year. 2021 customer growth was driven by Middle Markets and Select within U.S. commercial, Individual and Medicare Advantage within U.S. government and International Health. Overall, Cigna Healthcare supported and delivered for our customers, clients and partners during a challenging year and is well-positioned to both grow membership and expand margins in 2022. Turning to Corporate and Other Operations. The fourth quarter adjusted loss was $115 million and now includes positive earnings contributions from our International Life accident and supplemental benefits businesses held-for-sale pending divestiture. As Ralph noted, during the fourth quarter, we reported a special item charge of $119 million after tax related to actions to improve our organizational efficiency. These actions will capitalize on our scale and the progress we have made through automation, increased use of digital tools and continued innovation to better enable us to grow and expand in this dynamic marketplace. Overall, Cigna's 2021 results reflect our balanced portfolio and our commitment to accretive capital deployment to augment our organic growth. As we turn to 2022, our affordability initiatives, pricing actions and focus on operating efficiencies will drive income growth and margin expansion in Cigna Healthcare. This performance coupled with continued growth in Evernorth and accretive capital deployment, will drive attractive EPS growth. For the full year 2022 outlook, I'd like to first remind you that our outlook assumes the divestiture of our International Life accident and supplemental benefits businesses will close in the second quarter of this year. In total for the company, we expect consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $177 billion, representing growth of approximately 4%, excluding the impact from previously announced divestitures. We expect full year consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $6.95 billion or at least $22.40 per share, consistent with our prior EPS commentary. We project an expense ratio in the range of 6.9% to 7.3%, further improving upon our operational efficiency and ensuring continued affordable solutions for our clients and customers. And we expect a consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 22% to 22.5%. I'll now discuss our 2022 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we expect full year 2022 adjusted earnings of approximately $6.1 billion. This represents growth of about 5% over 2021, within our targeted long-term income growth range, reflecting strong growth in Accredo specialty pharmacy, all while we continue to increase investments in order to drive new innovative solutions to the market. For Cigna Healthcare, we expect full year 2022 adjusted earnings of approximately $3.9 billion. This outlook reflects the strength of our value proposition and focused execution in our business, driven by organic customer growth and disciplined pricing in order to expand margin. Some key assumptions reflected in our Cigna Healthcare earnings outlook for 2022 include the following : regarding total medical customers, we expect 2022 growth of at least 575,000 customers with the vast majority coming from an increase in U.S. Commercial fee-based customers. Within our U.S. commercial book, organic customer growth is driven by National, Middle Market and Select Market segments. We expect Medicare Advantage customers to be relatively flat compared to 2021, reflecting the competitive backdrop. And as David shared, we expect a decrease in our individual customers. We expect the 2022 medical care ratio to be in the range of 82% to 83.5%. As I noted earlier, this outlook assumes total medical costs will be above baseline in 2022. Importantly, we are actively managing overall medical costs with a range of affordability actions, including identifying opportunities such as guiding customers to more effective and efficient sites of care. For example, we focused our eviCore subsidiary on an incorporating site of care review to our existing processes. These improvements encourage the use of non-hospital settings, which can substantially reduce cost for customers while increasing patient satisfaction. This action has contributed to results within our commercial book of business, where we are now seeing fewer than 20% of all knee and hip replacements occurring in an inpatient hospital setting, down from over 75% in 2019. We are also continuing to promote preventive care, the targeted use of virtual care through our MDLIVE subsidiary and access to behavioral services to provide meaningful support to patients and moderate overall medical costs over the longer term. Through these affordability initiatives and our disciplined pricing actions, we expect to expand margins in 2022, while growing our medical customer base. Now moving to our capital management position and outlook. We expect our businesses to continue to drive strong cash flows and returns on capital, even as we increase strategic reinvestment to support long-term growth and innovation. In 2021, we finished the year with $7.2 billion of cash flow from operations. Additionally, we returned over $9 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchase in 2021, a significant increase from 2020. And now framing our capital outlook for 2022. We expect at least $8.25 billion of cash flow from operations, up more than $1 billion from 2021, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well-performing business. This positions us well to continue creating value through accretive capital deployment in line with our strategy and priorities. We expect to deploy approximately $1.25 billion to capital expenditures, an increase from our 2021 CapEx levels. The investments will be heavily focused on technology to drive future growth. We expect to deploy approximately $1.4 billion to shareholder dividends, reflecting our meaningful quarterly dividend of $1.12 per share, a 12% increase on a per share basis. And we expect to use the proceeds from the divestiture of our International Life accident and supplemental benefits businesses, primarily for share repurchase. Our guidance assumes full year 2022 weighted average shares to be in the range of 308 million to 312 million shares. Year-to-date, as of February 2, 2022, we have repurchased 2.5 million shares for $581 million. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. So now to recap. Our full year 2021 consolidated results reflect strong contributions from our focused growth platforms, led by Evernorth. Our 2022 outlook reflects meaningful contributions from each of our two largest segments, Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, along with accretive capital deployment. We are confident in our ability to deliver our 2022 full year adjusted earnings of at least $22.40 per share, consistent with our prior EPS commentary. Finally, as Ralph noted, we are looking forward to speaking with you in more detail at our upcoming Investor Day in June. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. Scott Fidel with Stephens. You may ask your question. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to just ask your thinking about seasonality for both MLR and adjusted EPS in 2022 relative to 2021 and maybe sort of typical historical seasonality, and just in particular, thinking about the fact that Omicron obviously still having an impact here in the first quarter, likely on the commercial book of business? Then also, as you talked about, given that you're planning to reprice some of the stop-loss business throughout the course of the year, interested in how you're thinking about the sequencing of the MLR over the course of the year as a result of that? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Scott, it's Brian. So I'll start with the seasonality component as it relates to the EPS cadence as well as the MCR. For purposes of what we expect relative to quarterly EPS, the 2021 pattern is actually a reasonable starting point as we think about the 2022 quarterly EPS that will emerge for us. And so more specifically, we would expect a little bit less than half to transpire in the first half of the year. And based on what we're seeing so far in January, the impact of Omicron, et cetera, working its way through our book, there's actually quite a bit of resemblance in terms of January 2022 to 2021, which again reinforces that '21 is a reasonable framework to use in terms of what to expect relative to EPS seasonality. As it relates to MCR, the full year guidance, as I indicated, is between 82% and 83.5% for the Cigna Healthcare book of business. So the midpoint of that, you can view as a reasonable starting point for the first quarter. We would expect to run a little bit below that in the quarter just based on, again, what the early read is here in January, coupled with the pattern we saw last year. So again, think of a little bit less than 50% of the overall EPS in the first half of the year, think of the first quarter MCR being a bit below the midpoint of our full year guide for Cigna Healthcare. As it relates to the stop-loss book of business, within the quarter. And importantly, you need to think of this as a full year accumulation product. So what ends up transpiring with this business is over the course of the year, claims are accumulated and then the fourth quarter of the policy period, there's essentially a true-up. And what we had occur in the fourth quarter of this year is particularly the smaller end of our stop-loss book, we had some of the lower attachment points pierced slightly more heavily than we had been anticipating. And so that created round numbers, you can think of it as about $70 million of medical cost pressure in the fourth quarter. Importantly, though, that's an annual number because it reflects the accumulation over the course of the year in 2021. So that $70 million in the fourth quarter is really a full year '21 number. We have assumed that that $70 million pressure will recur in 2022. So we have not assumed that we'll be able to recover that, and that's embedded in our $3.9 billion income guide for Cigna Healthcare. So to the extent we're able to reprice some of the cases with the later effective dates in '22, that could provide some level of upside relative to the $70 million assumption that's embedded in the guidance. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fidel. Our next question comes from Mr. Steven Valiquette with Barclays. You may ask your question. Steven Valiquette : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I apologize if I missed the details around this, but just regarding your commercial membership outlook for '22, can you remind us of your assumptions related specifically to potential additional members from the industry shift of Medicaid members to commercial around redeterminations commencing later this year? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Steve, it's Brian. I'll start and then David can add some color. So as I mentioned, we're expecting net customer growth in Cigna Healthcare of at least 575,000 customers in 2022, which we're really pleased with. And it's actually above what we would have expected a few months ago based on stronger-than-expected enrollment and retention. And as I noted, the vast majority of that will come through in the form of fee-based ASO-related customer relationships. Our membership outlook for '22 does not anticipate any growth from Medicaid redeterminations in either the commercial book or the individual book. So as you know, we don't continue to participate in the health plan space today in Medicaid. And therefore, as we think of the impact of redeterminations, it's only upside relative to our customer outlook. We have not modeled anything in terms of benefit in there. Anything you want to voice over, David? David Cordani : Yes, I would say, as I noted in my prepared remarks, within the commercial segment, we're pleased that our full year outlook for 2022 has growth in each of our three employer subsegments. So we're pleased with the outlook as we start the year, and we're pleased with the outlook for the full year. Steven Valiquette : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our next question comes from Mr. A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. Albert Rice : Yes. Hi, everybody. Maybe just a comment about your obviously continue to prioritize expanding in the government side. Two aspects to my question. One, is that still primarily on the Medicare side or is there any change in the thought about Medicaid opportunities? I know you've always said the more acute into Medicaid was of interest, but just an update on that. And then, there's been a lot of discussion about - from an organic standpoint, what's happening in the distribution channels for MA. Maybe get your assessment of where the market is today? And is your organic growth strategy taking advantage of maybe distribution channels in a different way than what you've done historically? David Cordani : A.J., it's David. Specific to the government expansion, stepping back, first, we continue to see the government space as an interesting and attractive growth space for us. We define that as MA individual exchange, we view as part of the government programs as well as Medicaid when we look at the space more broadly. To date, we focused in terms of using our levers and our focus more heavily on MA and on the individual business. In the end, we're pleased to highlight the fact that within our Evernorth service portfolio, our Evernorth service portfolio continues to be able to expand its Medicaid proposition through servicing health plans and other intermediaries. Additionally, as I noted in my prepared remarks, as we expand our Evernorth service capabilities, we see that as a meaningful value creator to MA, to the individual marketplace as well as to the Medicaid marketplace. And we think all of which are going to continue to evolve and be attractive. Specific to the MA distribution channels, no doubt some headlines have been produced relative to a little different dynamic. And our posture coming into 2022 was that 2022 was going to be a bit more dynamic year from an MA standpoint. Hence, we managed our portfolio to reduce our internal expectations of life growth and focus heavily on margin expansion with an eye toward 2022 - 2023's growth being a more accelerated growth environment. And I think we'll see a little bit more shake out relative to some of the channels that are evolving. For us, our channel traction on our retention has been pretty darn reasonable for 2022. We saw less new business growth year-over-year for Medicare Advantage, and we expected to see less new business growth in Medicare Advantage given our product and our pricing position. Albert Rice : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Mr. Gary Taylor with Cowen. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. One question and one clarification. The question is - or maybe they're both clarifications. I just want to go back to the commercial membership growth. I thought Brian had said mostly fee-based ASO. And then David, you had said growth across the segment. So I was just trying to piece together what your outlook was for Select, where you've had really the strongest growth and I would think would lean more towards risk versus fee? David Cordani : Gary, it's David. Your starting part of your frame is helpful. So when we think about it, we think about National, Regional or Mid and Select. Each of the segments have attractive growth for 2022 with National and Regional having very attractive growth outlook and all being - think about that as all fee-based. Second, to your point, within the Select segment, the Select segment has been and continues to be a very attractive growth segment for us. In any given year, the amount of new business we've written in that segment has varied anywhere between 70% ASO stop-loss and 30% risk to greater than 50% risk and less than 50% ASO stop-loss, it varies. So, we'll continue to write ASO stop-loss within the Select segment, and we'll write some guaranteed cost business in there, no doubt. But the aggregation of all the segments together and the strength of all three segments going to 2022 has a significant portion of our net customer growth being in the fee-based environment. Gary Taylor : Okay, that makes sense. I'll ask my other clarification offline. Thank you. David Cordani : Sure, thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Taylor. Our next question comes from Ms. Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan. You may ask your question. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good morning. David, can you give us some update around the PBM on the Evernorth side as we think about 2022 and 2023? So first off, on 2022, did you see any material changes as we think about contracting or programs that you're offering? And then as we think about the selling season for 2023, I know we're pretty early on, but any insights that you can give us as far as renewals, book of business that's up for renewal or how we think about how your PBM is doing? David Cordani : Sure. So let me start with the '23 selling season and put a backdrop of it. We're pleased with the performance we've carried now over multiple years within that subsegment of Evernorth and 2023 is guiding towards another attractive year for us. As it relates to - when you think about the growth equation you're asking about, we start with retention, we would expect at this point, our retention levels for 2023 to be at or above our 2022 retention levels. So we would see that as an attractive outlook. For 2023 growth, we have an active pipeline, and so we would see net new business adds coming through. And then context for you and our listeners, if you think about that business portfolio over the last several years, we've essentially had a net add of about 20 health plans into our portfolio of services. So positive and continued, I would say, sustained attractive performance. Importantly, in the earlier part of your comments in terms of you said contracts and programs, I think I'd draw your attention back to the programs. A cornerstone part of that business is to continue to innovate programs and services. Said otherwise, it's not just a base PBM or access offering. There's an evolution of programs that you would know is safeguard programs and evolution of safeguard programs that continue to enhance clinical programs and clinical engagement and clinical care coordination leveraging both with Express Scripts has the ability to do what Accredo has the ability to do and increasingly, what we're able to leverage off of some of the Cigna Healthcare capabilities working in both directions off the medical side of the proposition. So expansion of the services using your term programs has been mission-critical. And the final note I would say is our PBM team, as you call it, does a really good job of working client by client, be it a corporate client or in case of health clients to co-collaborate the innovations that work for them. And by doing so, helping them, our clients drive growth, which is mutually beneficial to both organizations. So wrapping up, we see 2023 as being another positive year, both from a retention as well as new business growth standpoint. Lisa Gill : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Gill. Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask, so you gave us a $70 million number, and it sounds like you're going to reprice fully for that in the stop-loss book. I know in the rest of the - your commercial risk book, you had some issues in 2021, you were repricing some of them in 2022, but not fully. Is there a number that you could share with us that you hope to get back for - in 2022 or 2023 in terms of repricing there so we can think about maybe some of the earnings momentum that we could see ahead as you get those books were priced? Brian Evanko : Justin, it's Brian. So I think your question was really specific to the fully insured part of the commercial book of business. And as I noted in my comments, there in the fourth quarter, we saw some elevated medical costs. And all in, you can think of that as also in that same general zone as the stop-loss pressure I mentioned of about $70 million. So the three drivers of the pressure : the stop-loss, the individual exchange and the fully insured that you can think of them as about 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 in terms of the medical care ratio pressure we had relative to our expectations in the quarter. So the fully insured component of that going forward, as David indicated in his comments, we started to see pressure emerge in the second quarter of 2021. If you recall, our second quarter MCR was elevated relative to our expectations. And that began a cycle of margin expansion on this book of business. So we've been repricing over the course of '21 and into '22 with the expectation of expanding margins. As we've talked about before, we don't expect that all to transpire in one year. And so when you look at the Cigna Healthcare income guide for next year - or this year, actually at $3.9 billion, that's up about $300 million from where we ended in 2021. That will improve our margin profile, but it doesn't get us all the way to our target margins in one year. So we have more opportunity in '23 and thereafter for further repricing actions. So in the fully insured book of business, in particular, the sold business so far has revenue yields in excess of cost trends. And you can think of that in the range of 100 to 150 basis points as we step into '22. So we'll get some margin expansion in that portfolio. We'd expect more in '23 as more of the business is repriced. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Mr. Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Matthew Borsch : Yes, I was hoping you could just comment a little bit more on the competitive prices in Medicare Advantage? And - at what point did you come to realize that those were going to meaningfully impact your enrollment outlook? And just - sorry, just related to that, partly really that if you can maybe give one comment on the advance notice on the 2023 rates we got last night? David Cordani : Matt, it's David. So specific to the Medicare Advantage environment for 2022, we were mindful of our willingness to trade, if you will, volume for margin as we're establishing our pricing for 2022, earlier in 2021. Did we have perfect insight? Of course, not, but we were mindful of that. To answer your question more specifically, clearly, when the competitive pricing by market became visible as you get ready to step into the annual enrollment period. We were able to look at market by market. And we're able to broadly see, in most markets, our level of benefit in price point positioning, clicking down one to three notches by market. So that gives you a context. And that's in an environment with the local scale with attractive medical cost configuration and with the Star's rating deep into the 80s. So as we looked at that environment, again, we were mindful of what was transpiring. And at that point, we were able to see that there would be more volatility. As I noted before, we saw reasonable retention, a little bit of pressure on retention, but less new business sales that came through. Now specific to your point, it's early, folks are coming through what was posted last night. But big picture, I put the headline number aside, it looks like a little over 4% net yields for the industry. And our assessment of ourselves, when you look at mix, kind of shaking you through, is about 4% yield with an eye for 2023. We view that as a positive, taking our current proposition, taking our current Star's rating, taking our current Net Promoter Score, taking the geographies we've expanded in and our disciplined orientation of stabilizing the environment for 2022. So we're looking forward to a very attractive growth opportunity for the Medicare Advantage portfolio of business in 2023. Matthew Borsch : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Our next question comes from Mr. Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I'll congratulate Ralph for joining. I want to get back to the comments that you made about the inorganic growth, specifically in the government segment. And I think - and perhaps this is the answer to understanding that there are significant potential synergies with Evernorth for new blocks of business in the government segment. But maybe just help us, what's changed over the last couple of years? What is most attractive for potential targets in your mind? How important is scale - large scale? And do you consider the organization prepared for large-scale M&A at this point? And then lastly, the last big one I think about in the government segment was HealthSpring, that asset, that growth rate hasn't really kept up with the market. So, I'm curious if there are lessons learned or things that you think are different this time around in terms of Cigna operating at a larger scale in the government segment? David Cordani : When you think about our inorganic priorities. First, our inorganic priorities augment our organic growth and then our disciplined focus to extending and expanding partnerships and then identifying inorganic opportunities. We have four categories, and I'll come to your core point in a second, four categories of focus : furthering our international proposition in key markets on the health space, furthering our U.S. government capabilities, furthering our care delivery and management capabilities more oriented toward the digital, the home, the behavioral side of the equation and then digital and technology support for our organization. As it relates to inorganic opportunities in the government space, I'm not going to call out any one as a priority, there's multiple subsegments. But as we look at inorganic priorities, to your point of scale, we have to conclude that, of course, they're strategically attractive, then we have to conclude they're financially attractive and then we have to conclude that we could essentially close them or create a level of certainty. So within the context of that, we take into consideration all the items in your question. Regulatorily, we recognize the environment is quite fluid right now. From a financial attractiveness, this includes the organizational readiness and our ability to create and capture value, we have to conclude for a larger transaction that the transaction will be accretive in its first full year of operations and generate an attractive ROIC. So that's an important part of the equation for us in terms of the way in which we would approach a transaction from that standpoint. And on a final note, we've built a diverse portfolio within Cigna, demonstrating that our Services portfolio is well positioned for continued growth and then within our Cigna Healthcare portfolio, we have multiple growth levers from Commercial to Government to our International Health capability. So we'll be opportunistic here if we see a significant value creator, but quite disciplined considering points I referenced relative to the strategic value creation - the financial value creation, which we're quite disciplined on and, of course, mindful of the regulatory environment. Josh Raskin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Mr. George Hill with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. George Hill : Yes. Good morning, guys. David, I wanted to pull on a thread that you just mentioned in the last comment, which was demand for digital. And I guess I would ask for demand for digital ex-telemedicine. I think before you guys bought ESI, they had started to build a digital formulary. Brian talked about increased investments in technology to drive future growth. So I guess I would talk about, are any of these initiatives material yet, again, ex-telemedicine? So are any of the digital initiatives really moving the needle at the bottom line? And I guess, could you talk about where future capital is going to be deployed to grow and fill out the white space here? David Cordani : So first, just a calibration point, the digital formulary, you made reference to, transpired as we're combined entities. And I think it's a good reinforcement of innovation. So I agree with you using that as an example of innovation. Two, I do appreciate you broadening the leverage and the value creation of digital beyond, although virtual health is massive beyond that. As we look into the organization, we see significant opportunity to leverage digital capabilities beyond. So I'll cite two examples just to be succinct, one of which I made reference to in terms of supporting our customers and patients with specific, highly personalized, immediately actionable information as they make their personal health decisions around consuming care. And I cited an example in orthopedics and musculoskeletal where there is a significant amount of preference and choice that the consumer patient has exercised. And we've learned over time, delivering information that is personalized and actionable at the moment that matters when decisions are being made is mission-critical, and we're able to improve value for that patient through better quality, better affordability and then share some of that benefit back to the client. So that's an example on the care side of the equation. On the administrative side of the equation, we talked about our ability to harness further leveraging the franchise off of shared services as well as our continued growth of our revenue portfolio. A digital-first framework is mission-critical within that. We have the ability to bring more personalized services on the administrative side of the equation, both to our customers as well as to our physician partners, and most of that lies upon a digital-first philosophy and framework and we continue to invest there. On a final note, some of the CapEx that Brian made reference to goes toward both of these dimensions, whether it's in the care enablement side of the equation or whether it's in the administrative service side of the equation. We see it as a meaningful value creator, and I appreciate you calling that out. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Hill. Our next question comes from Ms. Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is [indiscernible] on for Ricky. Just a couple of really quick questions. One question about the $119 million charge related to the strategic plan to drive operational efficiencies. Curious, what's the expected size of the cost savings, cadence, timing, is that baked into guidance? And then a second question on the MA rate notice. I know you addressed it a couple of times on the call. But just given how strong it was and '22 membership perhaps falling a bit short of expectations starting flat, any implications to competitive dynamics next year? Is your preference for maybe reinvestment into benefit richness or marketing and distribution channel? Brian Evanko : Michael, it's Brian. I'll take the first question, and then David can pick up on the Medicare Advantage component. So as we announced this morning, we are taking a charge in the quarter associated with organizational efficiency. And you can think of that the charge amount itself was about $168 million pretax. Over time, that will run rate to a number in the $200 million, $225 million range. And you can expect that, that full run rate will be achieved by 2023. A portion of that will come through in '22. Of course, that won't all drop to the bottom line. A portion of that will be redeployed in the form of more competitive prices and premiums out into the market. And just to give you a little more context there, I talked about automation, digitization. So a piece of this will be essentially removing unnecessary work and some of that will be personnel. There's also a significant piece in here associated with real estate. We made the decision after a couple of years into the pandemic that some sites should be closed permanently and/or some floors restacked, so there's a component here associated with real estate optimization as well. David, do you want to pick up on the Medicare Advantage component? David Cordani : Sure. And Michael, just transition from Brian's point, I'd point you to the fact that our SG&A ratio for 2021 was a very attractive number and our outlook for 2022 is a further improvement so back to embedded in our outlook as a further improvement to the SG&A ratio. Relative to the Medicare rate notice in the 2023 environment, we view it as just macro positive environment for us to lean into. I think to the core of your question, do we view it negatively or do we have regret relative to our growth posture for 2022 as we look to the rate notice for 2023? My answer to you is yes and no. Clearly, we would like more lives that are sustainable to be able to serve, but we believe being disciplined in this more fluid environment of '21 to '22, what was a better answer and better decision. And I would remind you, we're talking about numbers off of a book of business of about 550,000 lives. So within our portfolio, that's about 10% - 5% of the enterprise revenue, we're able to make those trade-off decisions. Looking to 2023, we see more opportunity, and when we see that opportunity off of our base, we see the opportunity off of our geographic expansion off the last two years, and we see that opportunity being further enabled by the rate environment for 2023; so we're excited by that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. Maybe just want to follow up with that and maybe broaden it a little bit to the exchanges as well. I guess I understand when you price for margin, you're going to grow below average, but MA is growing high single digits, you're flat. The exchanges is having one of the best growth rates we're probably going to see and you're down. And in both cases, you're expanding geographies. So the other companies who have talked about conservative pricing are still growing. So I just wanted to see a little bit more if you can talk about both MA and the exchanges as far as what gives you confidence that your products are going to be competitive and be able to grow? And I guess when you think about 2023 growth, are you talking about reacceleration off of flattish or are you talking about getting back to industry-level growth rates in those businesses for next year? David Cordani : Kevin, appreciate your questions. Two very different markets in two very different market environments. Specifically to the individual exchange environment, our point of view is adding more lives at 0 or negative margin is not a shareholder prudent posture. Two, in a marketplace that is fluid year in, year out, we've been able to prove that as that marketplace is unrelated. Our discipline has played through safe for the special enrollment period that played through in 2021. Our discipline has played through in a net positive way, as we've been able to build more geographies, more focus in geographies and yield a sustainable proposition. But to be very clear, our conclusion is that adding additional lives in a marketplace that's fluid year in, year out, at 0 or negative margin in a capital-intensive subsegment of the marketplace is not prudent. Looking forward, that marketplace will shake itself out as it has in the past, and we see attractive growth off of our existing geographies and new geographies. Relative to Medicare Advantage, your challenge is fair. I don't resist your macro challenge. In fact, we see that as opportunity versus downside relative to us. We've broadened our reach over the last couple of years meaningfully in terms of new MSAs as well as new counties. Our Star performance is deep within the 80s on a sustained basis, and our Net Promoter Score is quite high. So the cornerstone of the value proposition you can play through remains very attractive in the marketplace. I'd remind you that we've only participated in the individual market. And we've recently only participated in the individual HMO and PPO market over the recent vintage. So we looked within and said our strike zone was small, less than 20% of the addressable market. We've expanded that to about 30% of the addressable market. Now we'll continue to grow that over time. So we look at this current environment for both of these businesses, we're in 2022, we're able to be disciplined for both of those businesses and not chase low or 0 margin business and yield attractive revenue and earnings growth for the franchise and put ourselves in a position for what should be a very attractive 2023 for both of those businesses with attractive meaningful, sustainable growth outcomes. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Mr. Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Nathan Rich : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Brian, I just wanted to go back to the MCR guidance for '22. It implies, I think, about 50 to 200 basis points of improvement. You noted utilization now is expected to be above baseline. And I think if I heard you right on the first quarter, MMLR will be up a little bit year-over-year. So could you maybe just talk through the tailwinds that you see over the balance of the year as it relates to MCR? Brian Evanko : So I'll do my best to tackle different aspects of that question. And importantly, the guidance is on the Cigna Healthcare basis. So for purposes of comparability, it's important as you go back and look at our historical financials that you're looking at the Cigna Healthcare basis and not the prior U.S. medical basis. But in aggregate, for full year '21, we landed at 84% for the full year MCR. And to your point, the guidance is 82% to 83.5%. So take the midpoint of that, it's 125 basis points of improvement from '21 into '22. So all in, as I mentioned in my comments, and you mentioned in your question, we are expecting the absolute level of medical costs relative to baseline in 2022 to be similar in full year '22 than what we saw in full year '21. And so we were previously assuming that there would be some level of cost abatement in '22. We are no longer assuming that. We think that's a prudent posture to take stepping into 2022 in light of the year that just ended. So as a result of that, the MCR improvement year-over-year is attributable to both our revenue outlook, our affordability actions and some mix of business changes. So to give you a little more specificity there, if you were to decompose the 125 basis points, think of about 75 basis points of that associated with revenue yields in excess of our cost trends, predominantly in U.S. commercial. So as Justin asked earlier about the fully insured book, we are seeing revenue yields in excess of cost trends as well as the other subsegments of that portfolio. We expect about 25 basis points of improvement to come from our Medicare Advantage book, specifically the risk adjuster headwind that we incurred in 2021 will fully unwind here in 2022. We've got a good level of visibility on that. And then, the final 25 basis points is associated with our Individual and Family Plans book, in particular, the special enrollment period live that we described earlier, we expect the level of normalization in the medical care ratio from that book, both from a combination of the pricing actions we took, the improvement in terms of risk adjuster coding in '22, less pent-up demand and some industry-wide risk pool normalization. All of that contributes to about 25 basis points of improvement on the individual and family plans. So you put that all together and you get 125 basis points from the final '21 to the midpoint of our 2022 guide. Those are the big chunks I would encourage you to think about. Nathan Rich : Thanks. That's helpful. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rich. Our next question comes from Mr. Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question. Stephen Baxter : Yes, hi. Thanks. Just to follow up on Kevin's question on the exchanges. I guess I wanted to take a little bit more of the short-term orientation about 2022. Obviously, you're working to reprice this business and what remains a pretty competitive and price-sensitive market. So I was hoping you could give us a sense of how much this membership is set the decline in 2022, basically what we're going to see when you report your Q1 results? And then, such - because it's such a big swing factor for 2021, are you expecting this business will be at least breakeven for 2022 within the guidance you're establishing? Brian Evanko : Yes, Stephen, it's Brian. I'll start and then if David wants to pick up on any aspects, feel free to jump in here. So we ended the 2021 calendar year with 378,000 lives and as you know, the open enrollment period just ended a few weeks ago. So there's still some dust to settle in terms of who will follow through with first premium payments. We have extended grace periods on some of the customers, et cetera. So pinpointing the exact number is a bit of a challenge for the first quarter. But for the full year, based on how the open enrollment period just ended up, we would expect lives to be down in the range of 20%, 25%. So you can think of the 378 that we ended at year-end '21 coming down by that sort of magnitude by year-end '22. Intra-year, there's likely to be some net attrition. So I won't try to pinpoint the Q1 number, but you can expect it will be down from the year-end number and then we'll see some further attrition over the course of the year. Based on the pricing actions we took, we've seen our competitive position slide down in most geographies. So the renewals that we did get, we were pleased with because the prices are certainly firmer than they were in '21, which gives us good confidence in the margin expansion. And following up on the question that Nathan just asked me, we would expect all-in MCR improvement on this book of business of several hundred basis points when you think of the loss of the special enrollment period lives and the revenue yields that we were able to achieve. David Cordani : So therefore, margins expanding in the book to your point, not quite at but approaching more reasonably what our target margins are for the book of business, but not quite at that for 2022. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Baxter. Our next question comes from Mr. Dave Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question. David Windley : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. David, I wanted to come back to Medicare Advantage and ask what key levers do you think or what key changes do you need to make in the Medicare Advantage business to enrich benefits for competitive purposes, lower cost structure, in particular, to be profitable or closer to profitable at price points that you're talking about in the current environment? And what might Evernorth - how might you invoke Evernorth to help in that regard? David Cordani : So Dave, again, let's start with big picture. Big picture, the performance of that book of business as we step into 2022 has a pretty reasonable retention level, retention point is a couple of points below where we would like it to be given the competitive environment, just less new business sales. So from a value proposition for those we are serving today largely off of an individual HMO chassis and increasing off of an individual PPO chassis, the value proposition resonates for those that are consuming our services. But the new business side of the equation a little bit more challenging given the dynamics in the marketplace. I think we always enhance the value proposition. So to the core of your point, I would point toward two areas. One, the ability to continue to accelerate and enhance the collaboration between the pharmacy, the specialty pharmacy and the behavioral subcomponent of the proposition. And two, the ability to further leverage some alternative side of care opportunities for the benefit, in this case, of the senior beneficiary to deliver both better overall affordability and convenience. So you can think about that as alternative side of care being digital, home care or extending the services that could be delivered in a coordinated value-based physician relationship from that standpoint. We see both of those as net additional added value opportunities for both affordability as well as personalization for the individuals we serve. And both of those are enabled through further expansion of Evernorth. David Windley : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Windley. Our next question comes from Mr. Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. You may ask your question. Lance Wilkes : Yes. Hi, good morning. Just wanted to ask a question about outlook for the Evernorth PBM sort of business? And had three components here. One, I was interested in the amount of contribution in '21 and the outlook for '22 and beyond from specialty products going generic and how that's impacting margin? Then on a growth end was interested in what's the further upside with respect to potentially penetrating the Cigna book of ASO business? And then lastly, just on Prime Therapeutics, just interested in what the outlook is as far as renewing that contract? Obviously, you've been expanding and deepening your relationship. But just was interested in kind of how we should look at the security of that? David Cordani : Lance, it's David. You packed a lot into one question. Let us try to touch upon each. I'll take the Prime question. I'll take the upside on the Cigna book, and I'll ask Brian to take the specialty and specialty generic piece of the equation. First, specific to Prime, just at a more macro level, I'm not going to go through detailed renewal situation with the - on the line here. But if you take two steps back, Prime is a great reinforcement of our orientation around partnering. Our health plan business has continued to grow. I referenced previously, we've had net growth in our health plan portfolio of about 20 health plans over the last several years. Specific to Prime, we're proud to be able to serve our Prime both organization, health plans within it and the members. We've been able to expand the relationship and broaden the relationship over time. And importantly, Lance, we co-collaborate and co-innovate with the health plans within Prime to help to drive further growth for them. So we view it as a positive and it's a reinforcement of the meaningful and attractive sustained growth we've had in our health plan portfolio of businesses. As it relates to upside within the Cigna portfolio, we continue to drive leverage between the Cigna Healthcare portfolio and the Evernorth portfolio. For example, our growth recently with UPMC is an example of leverage between the two organizations, where we leverage some of our Cigna Healthcare capabilities within the Evernorth relationship for a strategic long-term partner when we were able to expand the relationship in that way. Specific to your - I think the traditional part of the way you're asking the question, I'll wrap up here, is on the PBM penetration within the Select segment always deemed that to be fully penetrated. Within the Middle Market segment, the level of penetration varies based on client relationship. We see some additional penetration as having been achieved. And then within National Accounts, it's an account by account relationship that is determined. So overall, we're pleased with our current state of penetration for PBM in Cigna Healthcare. It can move a little bit more, but I wouldn't have you look at it as a big barometer of movement rather the leverage of the relationships like a UPMC is a great example of, you're using the word penetration, we'll use the word cross-leverage and cross-value collaboration. Brian, I'd like you take the specialty in specialty generic piece. Brian Evanko : Yes. Overall, just kind of big picture, specialty generics and biosimilars are both really important mechanisms to drive affordability for our clients and customers over time, as they drive competition. And that's a really important part of the landscape here. And specialty was a meaningful driver of our results in 2021. And it will be in 2022 in the Evernorth space. So, well, I won't specifically size the contributions from specialty generics. It was helpful contributor over a multiyear period now to our ultimate P&L for Evernorth. And as we step into '22, I mentioned in my prepared comments, specialty will drive revenue growth in Evernorth. All in, we would expect our Evernorth growth to be within our long-term targeted growth range, meaning at least 4% revenue growth, powered heavily by specialty. Specialty Generics will be a part of that as will biosimilars and other parts of the drug space. So all in, we would expect Evernorth revenue to grow at least 4% for the coming year, and we expect income growth of 5% with Specialty Generics being a component of that. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Wilkes. Our next and last question comes from Mr. John Ransom with Raymond James. You may ask your question. John Ransom : Hey, good morning. Thanks for going a little long, team Cigna. The question I have is if - I know you guys aren't breaking out COVID costs anymore, but if we were to assume more of a normal cost, not trend, but just a cost reset in '23, could you please give a ZIP Code for what that would mean quantitatively? Brian Evanko : John, it's Brian. So you're right. We found it increasingly difficult to try to segregate COVID and non-COVID and the commentary we had earlier in '21 about COVID headwinds, particularly as you're finding more and more situations where an individual might be admitted to the hospital with one condition and then found to have COVID later on or the situation with our special enrollment period lives, what it was tough to determine is that a COVID-related issue or not. So we found it increasingly difficult, which is why we talk about all-in medical costs relative to the baseline. As I mentioned earlier, for full year '21, we ran above the baseline persistently for all four quarters across the book, and we've carried that assumption forward into 2022. And so you should think of that as, when I say above the baseline, not 1% above the baseline, but a few percentage points above the baseline. So think of low single digit to mid-single digit above the baseline. And then over time, if there's some moderation, that will provide tailwind relative to our '22 and/or subsequent outlook. John Ransom : And then this is one for David. I mean just strategically, I get to help out our benefit committee and betting vendors and things like that. And so we've been going through this cycle and what strikes me - and we're a pretty large ASO plan, what strikes me is what we're hearing from the consultants that we use as everybody is hot on using these navigators and I know you know they are. And so we're talking about like yet another overlay to sit on top of the PPO, which now needs to become a TPA, so you can steer and then there's quality information. We changed the number on the back of the card. So we're calling the navigator. And the reaction from our management was, gosh, it looks like it could save some money, but why do we need yet another layer on top? Why are the health plans not able to do this with all the reserves and IT and everything that they have it? So I'm just curious, you're a large ASO player. I just wonder what your thought is long-term about supplanting that function? Or do you think that's just - we're just going to add yet another function on top so that we can take three points out of the cost trend? David Cordani : Yes. Efficient work, John, you grabbed another question there. I think your question points toward the criticality of sustained innovation. And if you - as I know you do, if you go back and look at the space over the last couple of decades, there continues to be periods of time where specialists will take a slice of the value proposition. And I don't say that as being an immaterial or on an important size of the value proposition, but we'll take a slice of the value proposition and try to drive super specialization within that. Typically, what that results in is either consolidation of those capabilities or accelerate innovation of those capabilities to be coordinated. So we don't think the picture you articulate is sustainable. We don't think your coworkers want to have multiple touch points coordinating them. We don't think medical professionals want multiple touch points coordinating them. But rather, the theme of a navigator is totally on strategy for us. We have generations of that within our portfolio, within different solutions that have been in the marketplace for quite some time. One guy capability and certain clinical team capabilities and certain service capabilities, and having a digital-first philosophy, which is what I discussed previously, would reinforce to you that we continue to not only expand programs but expand the capabilities on a digital-first standpoint that could be able to do the navigation for our customers in a much more coordinated way. So we view that as on strategy, we view that as part of our CapEx, we view it as part of our capabilities within our portfolio and we have multiple positive proof points of how we've been able to convert that today, but we do not view that as an opportunity for the marketplace to disintermediate over a long period of time because that fragmentation is not sustainable; so opportunity for us. John Ransom : See, David, if I hadn't snuck in that question, you wouldn't have been able to give that answer. So I know you're happy with it. David Cordani : I appreciate your effectiveness, John. You have a great day. John Ransom : All right. Thank you. David Cordani : See you. Operator : I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : John reinforces that the operators suggestions are guidelines. But John, I do appreciate it very much. We want to thank everyone for your questions and importantly, your time this morning. And before I wrap up, I just have a couple of comments. First, I want to say how appreciative and proud I am of our more than 70,000 colleagues for continuing to serve our clients, our customers and patients in a very challenging environment. We've all gained an even greater appreciation of the importance of health and well-being during this prolonged pandemic. And in Cigna, we're committed to continuing to innovate to deliver more affordability, simplicity and predictability of solutions for our customers, our patients and our clients. Our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms are well positioned for sustained growth, and we're confident that 2022 will be another strong year for Cigna. Thanks, and have a great day.

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter queue to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Ralph Giacobbe. Please, go ahead Mr. Giacobbe. Ralph Giacobbe : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, Cigna's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's first quarter 2022 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for the year. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2022 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the first, quarter we recorded an after-tax special item charge of $37 million, or $0.12 per share, for integration and transaction-related costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2022 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated dividends. Also, our full year 2022 outlook assumes that the pending divestiture of Cigna's International life accident and supplemental benefits businesses will close in the second quarter of 2022, but does not assume any impact from other business combinations or divestitures that may occur after today. Finally, I would like to remind you of our upcoming Investor Day on June 3 in New York City, where we look forward to sharing our strategy and opportunities for sustained success and growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. We're off to a very good start to the year, with the first quarter defined by strong results across both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, positive momentum and focused execution, all of which are advancing our strategy and driving growth. We're pleased with our performance overall, specifically, with delivering adjusted EPS above our initial expectations. Today, I'm going to keep my comments relatively brief and focus on some of the key drivers of our performance. Brian will then provide additional details about our financial results and our outlook for 2022 and we'll take your questions. Then on June 3, we'll host our Investor Day, we will provide a deeper level of insights relative to our strategic vision, the growth profile of our businesses and differentiated drivers that will deliver sustained attractive growth. So let's jump in. In the first quarter, we delivered adjusted revenue of $44 billion and $6.01 of adjusted earnings per share. As a result of our strong results this quarter we are now raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance, underscoring our view that we will achieve another strong year of performance for our company in 2022. We also remain on track to generate $12 billion in deployable capital for the year and directing at least $7 billion to repurchase our shares I want to take a minute to thank our team for all their hard work that led disease outstanding results. Our more than 70000 colleagues in the world are committed to delivering our promise in the market day in day out. And as a result expanding our client customer relationships, all of which enables us to grow and deliver strong results for our shareholders. Now let's take a deeper look at Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms and the drivers of their performance. Following an outstanding year of growth in 2021, Evernorth maintained momentum with strong top and bottom line results in the quarter, driven in part by the sustained growth of our Accredo and Scripts specialty pharmacy business which continues to represent one of the fastest-growing parts of our health service portfolio  The key driver of this performance is the way in which Evernorth is increasingly resonating with a wide range of buyers including employers, health plans, governmental organizations and health care delivery systems. In an environment, we're getting people the right care and treatment at an affordable price is of paramount importance. I spent meaningful time over the past few months meeting with a number of our clients and partners and they consistently point to the attractive breadth and depth of Evernorth's services and expertise. Our clients rely upon these services and expertise to solve the most pressing health care needs. For some clients, this means tapping into the strength of our pharmacy services. Others that meet me are behavioral health support. With others, the unique specialty pharmacy expertise of the table. More and more our clients are seeking our solutions that leverage our broad high-performing portfolio of capabilities. For example, Evernorth recently launched a new provider consult service for patients with cancer. This service leverages our powerful analytics to identify and connect patients to their oncologists to cancer subspecialty experts and designated National Cancer Institute Centers. And this process enables patients to get access to the latest innovations in research with better health outcomes, lower costs and importantly, keeps the patient's care close to home and their family. This service augments our existing suite of oncology solutions including personalized case management, mental health care, financial support services, pharmacy solutions and collaborative partnerships with oncology providers. Additionally, on the strength of our offerings a couple of weeks ago, we announced a new long-term strategic collaboration between Evernorth and Kaiser Permanente. We're drawing utilities across both Evernorth and our Cigna Healthcare platforms in a way that creates new opportunities for serving a broad range of Kaiser's clients and customers. This builds on our successful relationships for example with Prime Therapeutics and the Department of Defense, both of which were recently renewed for extended track periods. Finally, it's still early in the 2022 selling season but we are continuing to see strong demand for our Evernorth services amongst existing and new clients and additional opportunities to deliver even more value, particularly as we expect more biosimilars to come to market over the coming years and we are seeing strong retention in our Evernorth portfolio of businesses. Turning to Cigna Healthcare, we delivered a strong start to the year. Our medical care ratio during the quarter was 81.5%, which was better than we had projected. This reflects the disciplined and targeted actions we initiated last year to improve our results including implementing new affordability efforts and pricing actions. In US Commercial, we achieved strong membership growth during the quarter with growth across each of our segments. At a time when employers are trying to navigate a complex economic landscape for their businesses and an emotionally taxing environment for their employees, many are turning to us is the right strategic growth partner to improve presenteeism, productivity and health outcomes. Employers tell us that they value the ability of our US commercial teams to partner with them in developing programs that guide employees to the right care at the right place at the right time, programs supporting them and attracting and retaining talent, through strong employer sponsor benefits programs and services, and programs providing greater predictability in managing financial risk for the companies while optimizing their cash flow during these uncertain times. Our International business also contributed to our growth during the quarter as it achieved higher customer retention and membership growth levels. We also remain on track with the divestiture of our International life, accident and supplemental benefits business in certain countries to jump. With our sharpened focus on health services, we continue to see attractive opportunities for serving multinational employers, governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and the globally mobile population. In our US government business, enrollment was down as expected as we prioritize margin expansion and completed the divestiture of our Texas Medicaid business. We continue to take actions to position our government business for growth in 2023 and over the long-term. Now to wrap up. Our first quarter results are strong. They underscore the momentum we're building as we serve the evolving needs of our customers and clients as well as continue to drive growth and margin improvement in our company. We delivered adjusted EPS of $6.01 and we continue to make strategic investments in our business while paying a meaningful dividend and remaining on path to repurchase at least $7 billion of our shares in 2022. With focused execution we are demonstrating our ability to navigate and lead through this continued dynamic environment for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. And now, with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Evanko : Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's first quarter 2022 results, and I'll discuss our updated outlook for the full year. As David noted, we are very pleased with our strong start to the year, as first quarter adjusted earnings per share were above our expectations. This performance combined with our continued momentum give us the confidence to increase our full year adjusted earnings outlook to at least $22.60 per share, representing growth of at least 10% off of our reported 2021 EPS. Looking at the first quarter specifically, some key consolidated financial highlights, include adjusted revenue growth of 8% to $44.1 million, after-tax adjusted earnings of $1.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $6.01. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. First quarter 2022 adjusted revenues grew 10% to $33.6 billion and pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion, both in line with our expectations. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by strong growth in our high-performing specialty pharmacy business and a continued focus on delivering lowest net cost solutions for our clients and customers. We also continue to make meaningful strategic investments for the expansion of client relationships, as well as a new solution development and digital capabilities. These investments ensure the continued differentiation of our scaled Evernorth businesses and support the expansion of our Evernorth Care capabilities. Overall, Evernorth continues to perform very well, with attractive top and bottom line growth, in line with our expectations. Turning to Cigna Healthcare, which, as a reminder, now includes our US commercial, US government and retained international health businesses. We ended the year prioritizing margin expansion, having taken targeted pricing and affordability actions during 2021 for impact in 2022. We also expected to drive customer growth in each of our US commercial market segments and we're pleased with how we started the year. For Cigna Healthcare overall, first quarter 2022 adjusted revenues were $11.4 billion, pretax adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion and the medical care ratio was 81.5%. The medical care ratio was better than our expectations in the quarter, primarily due to lower COVID testing and treatment costs. In January, COVID incidence was at its highest level throughout the pandemic, but case counts dropped significantly in February and March. Importantly, even during the January Omicron peak, we observed substantially lower severity than earlier in the pandemic and subsequently lower treatment costs. In total, Cigna Healthcare's earnings exceeded our expectations, driven by the favorable medical care ratio, strong specialty contributions and net investment income on our alternative asset portfolio. Net medical customer growth in Cigna Healthcare was also strong, as clients and customers continue to recognize the differentiated value we bring as a partner through our consultative approach and our innovative solutions. We ended the quarter with 17.8 million total medical customers, growth of 4%, or approximately 700,000 customers sequentially. This growth was driven almost entirely by an increase in fee-based customers. Notably, we grew across all of our US commercial market segments and in International health. US government enrollment decreased, as expected, inclusive of the divestiture of our Texas Medicaid business. Overall, Cigna Healthcare is off to a strong start in 2022. For Corporate and Other Operations, the first quarter 2022 pretax adjusted loss was $117 million. Across the enterprise, we delivered strong first quarter financial results with contributions across our diversified portfolio. Now with respect to our outlook for full year 2022, our strong start gives us the confidence to increase our full year earnings per share outlook, as I will detail in a moment. At Evernorth, we expect continued strong performance with both top and bottom line growth in line with long-term targets, all while continuing to invest in growth and innovation. In Cigna Healthcare, we expect to continue to grow customers, while expanding margins over 2021. We are raising our medical customer outlook to growth of at least 725,000 customers and reaffirming our 2022 medical care ratio outlook of 82% to 83.5%. For Cigna Healthcare in total, we now expect full year 2022 adjusted earnings of approximately $3.95 billion. Taken as a whole, we are raising our EPS guidance and now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $22.60 per share, representing growth of at least 10% over our reported 2021 earnings per share. Now moving to our 2022 capital management position and outlook. We expect our businesses to continue to generate strong cash flows and attractive return capital. In the first quarter of 2022, we increased our quarterly dividend by 12% to $1.12 per share. And year-to-date as of May 5, 2022, we have repurchased 7.6 million shares for approximately $1.8 billion. For full year 2022, we continue to expect at least $8.25 billion of cash flow from operations and to deploy at least $7 billion to share repurchases. We now expect full year weighted average shares of 310 million to 314 million shares, an increase of two million shares at the midpoint from our prior guidance, primarily due to our updated expectation for the timing of closing the international divestiture. We now expect this to occur later in the second quarter impacting the timing of our anticipated share repurchase. As a reminder, the financial performance of this business is included within Corporate and Other operations until the divestiture is complete. Our balance sheet and our cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. So now to recap. Results in the first quarter were above our expectations, reflecting strong contributions across our diversified portfolio. Evernorth continues to deliver strong top and bottom line growth in line with our expectations, while Cigna Healthcare has had a strong start to the year giving us the confidence to deliver on our increased 2022 EPS guidance of at least $22.60. I look forward to continuing to discuss our performance, our strategy and our long-term financial outlook with all of you at our upcoming Investor Day on June 3. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Matthew Borsch : I guess I was wondering if you could just talk to the gain on ASO enrollment, and how you saw the national account selling season, so I gather that probably as much from middle market as it is from large employers. Can you just talk to that? David Cordani : Matthew, good morning, it's David. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we're quite pleased with the start of the year and our full year outlook relative to our commercial portfolio. And the commercial portfolio performed very well across each of the segments National Accounts, Middle Market and our Select segment. And as Brian noted our growth is essentially all ASO self-funded services with our appropriate specialty services are attached to it. I'd highlight a few things. One, strong retention across the block of business. So, we're sought to move forward with some pricing in some of the segments. Two, we've further deepened relationships and we had some wonderful new business adds across the portfolio and notably within the Middle Market. So, headline there is some very good strength across the board from both retention as well as new business adds. And as you noted essentially all self-funded which as you know we really appreciate the self-funded opportunities because we have good alignment, good transparency, and ongoing collaboration with our clients around the program development and the we're able to deliver. Matthew Borsch : Fantastic. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Our next question comes from Mr. Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question. Stephen Baxter : Yes, hi. Thanks. I just wanted to follow-up on that a little bit. Would just love to get a better sense of how that retention rate for vital business compared to previous years. And then as you look at the growth that you saw I guess would love to hear a little bit about any color you have on the split between in group and new clients? And then, I guess, how you think about the sustainability of that growth given where you are in the process of rebuilding margin in the stop-loss product? Thank you. David Cordani : Sure Stephen, good morning. It's David. So, a couple of dimensions to your question. First broadly speaking the retention rate -- and I would note that we were quite pleased with the retention rate across the portfolio but specifically in the Select segment where we pushed for a little bit further rate execution on the guaranteed cost or risk side of the portfolio even without our retention rate was a bit stronger than we anticipated showing that our product and our portfolio continues to resonate. Secondly, an ice mix of obviously, retention to achieve the growth we have. We have to have new business growth. That's both in existing relationships expanding to new geographies or subsets of portfolios and new business adds. I highlight as we talked in the prior quarter a very nice large win which shows up in our Middle Market portfolio because it's a locally dense relationship that was achieved through an excellent collaboration between Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare where we had a large long-standing high-performing Evernorth relationship that we're able to introduce the Cigna Healthcare portfolio to and grow from that standpoint. So, retention a bit stronger I would call out the select segment great work that that team is doing retention is strong across the board and new business adds in each of the segments both in existing relationships and new relationships that we added. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Baxter. Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open, you may ask your question. Mr. Lake your line is open, you may ask your question. Please test your mute feature. We'll go on to the next question. The next question comes from Mr. Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Nathan Rich : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on Evernorth. Nice revenue performance in the quarter, it sounds like specialty continues to be a tailwind. I guess for the year, can you maybe talk about where the gains in specialty are coming from? Is that, kind of, continuation of maybe some new exclusive relationships on that side? And then given the revenue strength, we didn't quite see flow through to the bottom line. It looks like expenses might have been a little bit higher there. And David and Brian, I think you mentioned some investments. Are those more one-time, or should we think about that as sort of the run rate for SG&A in that segment? Thank you. David Cordani : Good morning. It's David. Let me take the first part of your question, and I'll ask Brian to take the second part of your question. As you called out, the specialty performance within Evernorth continues to be quite strong. We're really pleased with the performance of our overall portfolio, and specifically specialty as you know. I'd remind you that, our specialty portfolio, serves multiple segments. Specifically, Accredo Think about that as serving individual direct patient needs on a highly focused basis, including in-home care coordination where appropriate, and Scripts supporting medical professionals by delivering the right drug at the right time for purposes of their services and their needs. I'd also note that, as you would expect, our team is quite excited about and well positioned for the accelerating biosimilar trend that we see in front of us for the coming years. And we're success in the biosimilar space will require not only strong performing specialty capabilities in terms of the breadth of the specialty capabilities, but high coordination on the medical side of the equation, because those decisions as you know are typically made one patient at a time in terms of coordinating the transition of care, where appropriate, unless there's a perfect match from that standpoint. So strength in both the consumer part of our specialty portfolio, as well as the healthcare professional part of our specialty portfolio, and well positioned for evolving biosimilar acceleration as we go forward leveraging our specialty capabilities as well as our medical capabilities. I would not call out any unique drug class changes as a driver of growth, but let me transition to Bryan to expand on that and the second part of your question. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Nathan. So in terms of the expense growth in the quarter for Evernorth vis-\u00e0-vis the revenue growth, and how thinking about the full year there. As you noted, the SG&A was up 13% quarter-over-quarter Evernorth, while the revenue was up 10%. You can think of the expense growth is predominantly fueling future growth within Evernorth. So I mentioned earlier, we're making strategic investments to build out our Evernorth Care platform. When you think about Care management, Care coordination Care delivery, alternate sites of Care. We talked to you about virtual care in the past behavioral health in home care. We're making a series of investments there. That won't just be limited to the first quarter. There will be a multi-year investments to continue to diversify our health services portfolio within Evernorth. But for the full year, importantly, our income for Evernorth will be up 5% from where it was in 2021, and our revenue will be up in that same general zone. So you should not think of margin erosion transpiring for the full year even though expenses grew a bit faster than revenue within the first quarter. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rich. Our next question comes from Mr. Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question. Josh Raskin : Thanks. Good morning. I was interested in the announcement you mentioned around the cancer console service launch. And can you speak to who the targets are for that product? Is that an internal sales process to your existing health plans? And I guess, more importantly, are there other physician enablement services that you think you can add in the future through Evernorth? David Cordani : Josh, good morning, it's David. First, relative to the space and really appreciate you re-amplifying the oncology opportunity. As we know, the volume of oncology needs in the United States other markets as well but in the United States continues to grow. And we're really pleased with the innovation that is taking place. So we're taking an analytical approach to identify individual patients. So the target market are individual patients that we serve today. So think about that through either Cigna Healthcare and our diversity in healthcare relationships. And increasingly going forward, a service that we'll be able to be offered to our Evernorth health playing clients as an example as a consult to bring that level of precision, identify individual patients who in coordination with their specific oncologists so analytical matching of the patient their oncologist where we determine that by matching them to a center of excellence and bringing the consult precisely back to the patient with their oncologists we could advance quality, affordability and the overall care equation without in many cases needing to have the patient transport themselves to the center of excellence. So it's an example of bringing the Precision two by using the data and the care coordination and our partnerships. So the target audience is individual patients largely through our Cigna Healthcare portfolio, through the rollout that's taking place right now but increasingly as in Evernorth service be able to be offered to our health plan clients and others. And then secondly, if I heard your \u2013 the latter part of your question correctly, think about these types of approaches as indicative and we talk about what Brian made reference to in terms of Evernorth Care, opportunities to again curate and coordinate more of the Care equation, using data and then the breadth of care to bring more services forward. And we'll seek to provide some additional insights relative to at our Investor Day some additional programs that we'll be rolling out in this year not oncologic waste but taking a similar harnessing of data and real-time service delivery. Really appreciate your question. Josh Raskin : Thanks. Operator : Thank you Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Mr. Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Scott Fidel : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Sure this is another topic that you're going to be delving into more at Investor Day. But just interested from this point in time, as we look out to 2023, if you could just give us some updates on how you've been looking to refresh the strategy for MA to resume growth in the market for 2023, especially now that we've got the final rates out which clearly looks pretty solid for the industry? David Cordani : Scott, good morning. You're right we will cover that in June, but let me just profile the broader direction. First and foremost, we continue to see our government segment and specifically within that Medicare Advantage as a very attractive sustained growth opportunity. In 2022, we're in year three of our expansion and growth initiative. And while clearly 2022 was well short of our specific growth algorithm for a variety of reasons including market conditions. Our three-year average growth was just a bit below our low end of our strategic range. Now specific to 2023, we are building our plans and initiatives, specifically to drive attractive growth in 2023. We'll profile a little further. We'll leverage our strong stars positioning, our NPS positioning and our overall medical cost in our targeted MSAs. And I would remind you that we're largely an individual HMO and individual PPO oriented organization. Two, we will demonstrate at Investor Day but we'll \u2013 our plans are building on harnessing now some of the investment we've made in terms of our market expansions over the last couple of years, whereby the early yield traction on market expansion is low in year one. But by the time you get out to year three, we have higher expectations, targeted investments in marketing and distribution. And then importantly, we expect in 2023 to begin to realize more yield off of our commercial agent population and PDP and med sup conversion opportunities that's in front of us. So specifically, our expectations will be and we're building our plans around an attractive growth year for 2023. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fidel. Our next question comes from Mr. Steven Valiquette with Barclay. Your line is open. You may ask your question. One moment please. Steven Valiquette : Yeah. Thanks. Yes. Good morning everybody. So regarding the medical cost trends, is there any further color around the pace of traditional non-COVID utilization trends versus baseline exiting the first quarter and into the second quarter? Also I'm curious, was there any thought to narrowing the top end of the MLR guidance range of 2022, just given the better-than-expected 1Q MLR results? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Steve. It's Brian. So, I'll try to tackle both of those questions here. In terms of the medical cost performance in the first quarter, as I noted earlier, we saw some favorability come through in the form of COVID costs in particular compared to our expectations in the first quarter. So both testing and treatment came in a bit favorable to what we had been forecasting for the first quarter of the year. And that was true across the commercial book of business in the most pronounced fashion, but in totality for Cigna Healthcare. As it relates to non-COVID, the non-COVID costs came in essentially right where we were expecting them to, meaning, if you look at it on a cost trend basis, the cost trends compared to the first quarter of 2021 we're very much in line with our expectations in terms of seeing a normal kind of low-to-mid-single-digit type cost trend on the non-COVID services. We're not really seeing any signs of acuity spikes or pent-up demand, emerge things like blood screenings, preventive exams, mammograms, colonoscopies are all in line with where they were in 2019, on a per capita basis. And for that matter really were in 2021 as well. So non-COVID shaping up very much in line with what we had been expecting coming into the year. As it relates to the full year outlook for the medical care ratio, you're right we reaffirmed the 82% to the 83.5% range, despite the first quarter coming in a bit favorable. We felt like just being one quarter into the year. This was a prudent thing for us to do and a prudent posture to take given there's three more quarters and respecting that COVID had a lot of twists and turns over the past couple of years. But it would be reasonable to assume the midpoint of our range maybe shading slightly towards the lower half of the range, as you were thinking about where the full year is likely to shake out based on what we've seen so far. Steven Valiquette : Got it. Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our next question comes from Mr. A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. A.J. Rice: HI everybody. Maybe I'll just ask about the biosimilar opportunity. I know that is out there, but it's a little bit difficult to quantify what it might look like. I guess, can you give us any update on ongoing discussions you're having with the various players? And whether that's provided any clarity? And in your mind, do you think you will get a sense of what the opportunity might be both for Evernorth and I guess, to some degree even with the benefits business? David Cordani : Good morning, A.J., it's David. In some ways it's early -- in other ways, the trend is upon us right? We're seeing the convergence which is a net positive. We think it's a net positive from a -- standpoint relative to the opportunity to further improve affordability. And given our Evernorth model, we have the services with Evernorth and some leverage relative to Cigna Healthcare to really harness this opportunity on a go-forward basis. We don't think there's a single influent point that exists. Maybe that's inferred in your comment. So it's not as though 2023 or 2025 is the single year, we see a ramping of activity. And our teams as you would expect are working class-by-class, drug-by-drug with manufacturers as well as with the programs that we will have in place. And the choices we will be able to offer our clients. I think, very importantly, the consultative nature of the way Evernorth supports our clients will be even more pronounced and more beneficial with the biosimilar trends, as it evolves. As you would expect, given the energy we have relative to our specialty portfolio and its respective traction, this will be an area we\u2019ll seek to amplify a bit more specifically at our Investor Day. But suffice to say, there's not a singular inflection point, 2023 is an important year, with some convergence, but 2024, 2025 begin to ramp and beyond. So we're well positioned relative to that, to improve affordability for our clients and customers and have Evernorth benefit from the value it's creating for our clients, customers and patients. A.J. Rice: Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Mr. Gary Taylor with Cowen. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Gary Taylor : Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask a little bit more about PBM, when we look at the adjusted claims down 2% year-over-year. A couple of questions. I don't think vaccines were yet material to the prior year. So I just wanted to see if that was mostly just the health plan losses impacting that. It wasn't related to vaccines. And then a few months ago, when you were asked about PBM selling season, obviously, it was very early, it's still early, but you had said you expected at least similar, if not, better retention than 2022, which I think was mid-90s. I just wanted to see if there was any update to that thinking? David Cordani : Good morning, Gary. It's David. Let me start and then ask Brian to talk a little bit more relative to the Evernorth growth framework and why Scripts are, I think, an important example, but given the breadth of Evernorth, no longer the sole example that you should be looking at. Specific to your framing, relative to the current year, broadly speaking, I think, your walk-in faming is right. There was -- we had a little lower retention rate than our historic average and clearly, lower than our phenomenal 2019 and 2020 retention level from that standpoint. Your question, I think, goes to 2023 and as I noted we're positioned to have another strong growth year for 2023 for Evernorth, both on a new business and on a renewal basis. Now specific to PBM, before I transition over to Brian, to talk a little bit more relative to the Evernorth growth, we're right at about a 90% visibility. So about 90% of the books already renewed, which is good at this point, in time of the year and we feel quite strong relative to that. And as we sit here right now, specific to the PBM portion of Evernorth, which is what you're asking about, we expect our retention to be higher than 2022\u2019s retention level and revert back to more of the historic norm of 95% or a bit better from that standpoint. But importantly 90% of the book is renewed and we still have some active selling that sits in front of us right now, because the marketplace continues to be pretty fluid in the current environment. Brian? Brian Evanko : Good morning, Gary. Back on the first part of your question in terms of the first quarter 2022 Scripts volumes and such. I think your macro conclusion is right in terms of the Scripts being down 2% is largely a function of the client wins and losses and the net effect of that. The vaccines were pretty flat year-over-year. If you look at the first quarter of 2022 versus first quarter 2021, within 1 million or so Scripts, so that's really not a material driver quarter-over-quarter. Importantly, though, as David, into that, here, as each day passes, the total script count metric becomes less and less important to measuring Evernorth's overall performance. And what do I mean by that is, we have more and more volume coming through our specialty pharmacy, as we have more and more volume coming through our Care platform, you're going to see more earnings and more revenue associated with things that are not directly linked to Scripts. So, as an example, within Specialty, Specialty just crossed over the 35% mark in terms of contribution to overall Evernorth revenue, but it represents less than 1% of our overall prescription volume. So, over 35% of the revenue, less than 1% of the prescriptions. So again, just that metric, I would encourage you to gradually move away from when you're looking at the health of the Evernorth business in totality. Gary Taylor : Yes. I mean the revenue performance supports it. So, got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Taylor. Our next question comes from Ms. Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Lisa Gill : Hi. Thanks very much and good morning. David, I just want to follow-up on Evernorth care capabilities? And how you think about MDLIVE sitting into that? And there's been some pressure in the market when we think about behavioral health. And I've heard you talked so many times about whole person health and really thinking about the integration of the two. But -- how do we think about how Ginger fits into that? And how we think about again Evernorth Care capabilities overall when we think about your offerings going into 2023? David Cordani : Good morning, Lisa. Good to chat with you this morning. So, there's a couple of different I think flavors to your question. Let me try to be succinct as I can with them. First, the whole person health or the coordination of care and services remains mission-critical and as we've learned as a society has been amplified in this COVID environment. So first, by way of background, we continue to expand access to behavioral services, whether it's expanding a network in a traditional sense, whether it's expanding behavioral services through virtual care, whether it's being the first have virtual care capabilities, be covered as in-network services through the likes of Ginger. But then, the next step is how do you coordinate point solutions like that and bring them together. And so, let's walk that across MDLIVE. MDLIVE is a great example, and we couldn't be more pleased by having that asset as part of the company to be able to innovate off of, because MDLIVE underscores as a symbol our view and commitment that harnessing technology and data to bring more services on a real time highly personalized basis to a patient or individual, presents one of the biggest opportunities in front of our society for the coming years. And specifically, as you take virtual care and you coordinate medical, behavioral, pharmacy services, et cetera and coordinate those services, patients benefit at a significant level. As we click it down another notch, we've seen some disruption in the marketplace, but I would remind you that our model is not a B2C model dependent upon B2C activation only building off of a triage of it. Or is more B2B and then cultivating the relationship with the customer, whether it's through an employer, a health plan or a health care professional organization and then, end with a fact to underscore our MDLIVE volumes year-over-year Q1 2021 versus Q1 2022, we're up about 29%. So an area where we have significant conviction being able to again coordinate point solutions as opposed to just push point solutions and having it, be highly patient-centric in real time represents a tremendous opportunity and we're pleased with our progress thus far. Lisa Gill : And I'm sure you're going to answer this at the Analyst Day, David but really, the second part of my question was how do we think about this opportunity in 2023? Do you feel that this is driving a bigger market opportunity for you? I know you talked earlier about the cross-sell of Evernorth with Cigna Health but -- any kind of number of a market opportunity you can put around this? David Cordani : Yes. So Lisa, I'm sorry, I didn't touch upon that. And you're right we will touch upon that at Investor Day. So, I'll just try to what your appetite by saying, absolutely, we see tremendous opportunity. So, when you think about it, the leverage between Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare's portfolio, we already have significant proof points and traction relative to that, and there's more opportunity that Eric and our colleagues will walk through when we're at Investor Day. But importantly those services are not limited to Cigna Healthcare, everything we're building within Evernorth is built with an eye toward, yes Cigna Healthcare as a client to improve quality and affordability and we'll walk through proof points relative to that. But simultaneously to be able to bring it to market to stand-alone employer relationships that minor serves, our health plan clients integrated delivery systems et cetera on a go-forward basis. So we see that addressable market underscoring your point to be quite broad, quite large in terms of what we're building and the ability to improve affordability, personalization and clinical quality, whether it's for Cigna Healthcare or other relationships present a tremendous opportunity and we will amplify that Investor Day. Lisa Gill : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Gill. Our next question comes from Austin Gerlach with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Justin Lake : Thanks. This is Justin Lake. Did I get in this time? David Cordani : Justin you're live, but you have different names. So you have an alias this morning. It's good to hear your voice. Justin Lake : Well, since I can't figure out the mute function I probably should change my name. So look I want to squeeze in two quick questions here just numbers based. One, can you give us a little color on how the rise in interest rates that we're seeing out there could affect you over the next year or two from an earnings perspective? And secondly any help on earnings seasonality in terms of first half, second half would be appreciated? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Justin it's Brian. So in terms of interest rates, the macro conclusion you should draw as you think about Cigna is directionally positive when interest rates move up, but also not terribly material in the grand scheme of things in terms of the direct quantifiable impact. The majority of our balance sheet whether you look at the asset side or the liability side and fixed rate longer-term instruments and those that are shorter term in nature or carry a variable rate. We tend to have on a net basis slightly more exposure on the asset side than the liability side, which creates some favorability in terms of the investment income spread and such. So -- but to mentioning it you shouldn't think of this as terribly material. It's in the call it $20 million to $30 million range annually if you were to look at a 100 basis point move in, in rates order of magnitude. As it relates to the earnings seasonality and I'll talk in EPS terms. Given the strength of the first quarter, you should think of the overall first half of the year is generating about half or roughly half of the full year earnings per share emergence. And then in the back half of the year, we tend to see the fourth quarter as a lower point relative to the third quarter just given the seasonality in the Cigna Healthcare book of business where deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums tend to be met more frequently. So you should think of third quarter being a little bit stronger than the fourth quarter. Justin Lake : Thanks for that. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. You may ask your question. Kevin Caliendo : Hi. I just wanted to get a little bit more information on the Kaiser partnership. How that came about? What does it mean? How meaningful can it be? Where can it go in the future? David Cordani : Good morning Kevin, it's David. Before we get into the Kaiser opportunity, which I will. I remind you that, we talk about a strategic imperative in the company that we referred to. Our objective as we seek to be the undisputed part of choice. Why do we say that? Because we're guided by a tenant that suggests that if we could identify alignment with potential partners, which I'll come back to Kaiser, we could have the opportunity together to create more value. More reach, more service, more affordability, more clinical quality. So specific to Kaiser that fits into the category and we could not be more excited and pleased with the opportunity to partner up with Kaiser It represents a multiyear strategic relationship where we together can improve access value and affordability.  And as I noted in my prepared remarks, it builds on a successful track record with organizations like Prime Therapeutics where we'll look at a totally different organization with the Department of where we successfully renewed both Prime Therapeutics in the Department of Defense and expanded relationships are recently UPMC et cetera. So it's an orientation, relative to collaborating in a different way and leveraging not only Evernorth's capabilities but in many cases the Cigna Healthcare capabilities. So as it relates to the core of your question in 2022, I would not view it as a major top line or bottom driver given the size and breather Corporation. But as we've proven with other relationships we see it as an opportunity that will have significant and attractive growth over the coming years as we collaborate together and co-innovate together for both top line and bottom line which will be reinforcing of growing in relationships. So I'd ask you to put in the category of a an orientation and a long track record of successful partnerships and we could not be more pleased to partner up with Kaiser and build some shared capabilities and innovation to serve clients and customers with better affordability and reach make clinical quality. Q \u2013 Kevin Caliendo : Great. Thanks so much Operator : Thank you Mr, Caliendo. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. Great. Thanks. Just wanted to go into the guidance a little bit. The Q1 beat was a bit stronger than what the guidance increases. I was wondering if you could help us think about how much of the outperformance was just timing versus you using the outperformance to invest in some of the growth initiatives versus any new kind of offsets in the back half of the that you might be thinking of? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Kevin it's Brian. So obviously, we're really pleased with having such a strong start to the year. One thing I would note is, I saw some of the early headlines here in the morning. Our own expectations were a bit higher than consensus for the first quarter. So we had a slightly different quarterly pattern as you think about the magnitude of the first quarter beat. Now we were ahead of our own expectations as I mentioned earlier as well, but just not to the same tune as where I think -- the Street had come in for the first quarter expectations. But as you think about the balance of the year there's really nothing specific I would call out in terms of things that will reverse later or looming issues that might emerge in the second half of the year as you alluded to. We just feel this is a prudent posture to take being just one quarter into the year to raise by $0.20. And keep in mind that's an at least $22.60 EPS expectation for the year. As always, we'll also evaluate additional strategic investments as the year unfolds and digital capabilities and other technology that we're looking to bring to market. But again, there's nothing in particular I'd flag as you think about the balance of the year. Kevin Fischbeck : Is the $0.20 guidance range more in line with the beat in the quarter versus your own expectations, or is there still some conservatism or investment spend delta? Brian Evanko : Yes. As I said earlier, we think this is just a prudent move at this point in the year we release in particular with Cigna Healthcare being above our expectations. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. Thanks Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Mr. George Hill with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. George Hill : Yeah. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking this question. I'm going to ask a couple more about Evernorth. Brian, you talked about specialty being 35% of revs less than 1% of Rx. Is any chance you'd give us the adjusted OP contribution? And then David, I would ask you, as it relates to PBM, while we're not seeing a lot of movement at the national level we're tracking a bunch of state regulatory initiatives, which could seem to have a negative impact on the PBM business profitability there. I guess, would just love how you're thinking about that and if you're seeing anything that's kind of raising the caution flag internally that we should be thinking about? Brian Evanko : Good morning, George, it's Brian. I'll start on the first point, and then David will pick up on the second. As you about our specialty pharmacy business, again, we continue to be really pleased with the performance over a multiyear period here, we've had really attractive top and bottom line growth and with biosimilars coming, it will provide some further fuel as we look forward. Directionally, you should think of the margin profile on the specialty pharmacy as we not tremendously different than the overall segment just, if you were to sum up to date. But importantly, there's some scrambled eggs, if you will when you think about many of our client relationships are not specific to just specialty or just PBM or just mail order. So we tend to get overall client profitability and not just necessarily one silo within ever north. But you shouldn't think of it as being terribly different than the overall segment margin profile. David, do you want to pick up on the second piece of George's question? David Cordani : Sure, George. No doubt, the environment has remained active. As you noted from a state, as well as federal standpoint, we do not see any one item, I think underlying your question do we see any one item or one theme as a de-railer relative to our business strategy or capabilities? No. And more macro, we are aligned around initiatives that seek to further improve affordability. All aspects of what we do day in day out within our pharmacy services portfolio, are to drive the right level of differentiated affordability, of course, with clinical and service quality always matched up against that, and we're quite proud of what we've been able to do. And I would note, just as an example, it seems like just yesterday, but it's actually three years ago, we launched our patient assurance program for insulin customers. And today, we have 10 million customers in the patient assurance program just three years later. And the patient assurance program was uniquely designed at that time, and still differentiated in the marketplace. The caps a 30-day outlay for an individual customer at $25. So more broadly to your question, it is active. We do not see any one item as a rally relative to our strategy rather the breadth of our services, capabilities, funding, mechanisms and our approach relative to integrating services we see as creating more opportunities than not as we seek to innovate and redefine the way we're able to bring those services to market. George Hill : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Hill. The next question comes from Ms. Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Ricky Goldwasser : Hi. Yeah. Hi, good morning. So there are two quick ones here. First of all David, as we think about sort of your care delivery strategy of primary care any \u2013 given where sort of market value anchors are now any appetite to complement your current assets with M&A, or do you think that you have the \u2013 what you need in terms of assets? And from now on you're going to build organically? And then just on the biosimilar, specifically, HUMIRA it's dispensed by the specialty pharmacy. When we think about biosimilar introduction and the bioequivalent in 2023? Is this embedded into your long-term target adjusted earnings growth of 4% to 6% for Evernorth, or does it represent some upside optionality depending on how the market plays out? David Cordani : Ricky, good morning, it's David. I'll take your first question. I'll ask Brian to take your second question. Specifically, the first question comes back toward care delivery and I think underscoring that is primary care delivery in the marketplace. Our orientation today relative to care delivery more broadly is we seek to own and differentiate in target areas within care delivery. Those areas include virtual care, specialty pharmacy care and services aspects of behavior health care and services, aspects of home health care services. We see these as sustainable differentiated services that can be leveraged and coordinated. And in many cases function on a nationalized basis or a more seamless basis across multiple geographies. As it relates to physical primary care outside of say, virtual care, which would have primary in it, but physical primary care our stated strategy remains, we seek to partner with and enable health care professionals with aligned incentive models in our care coordination services and that continued to perform -- that strategy has continued to perform very well for us both in a capital-light service orientation, but in the shared collaboration as underscored by our sustained differentiated medical cost trend in clinical quality and NPS we've been able to deliver. Lastly, I would say, Ricky that as we've noted in the past, we are willing to own as we do in a select MSA in the Southwest. We are willing to own primary care physical assets. If we conclude that the only way to get the right balance of affordability access and quality is through ownership, but our preferred approach is again to partner and enable and that has served us well for quite some time, while we seek to differentiate ourself in virtual specialty pharmacy behavioral and home care. Brian, I'll ask you to pick up on Humira. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Ricky. So in terms of biosimilars and how we think about Humira relative to the long-term 4% to 6% expectation, we're at a bit of an inflection point right now, because we're getting ready for some acceleration in the biosimilar market as you know over the next two to three years. And David talked about this in response to an earlier question. But even Humira alone and Stelara, those two drugs by themselves represent about 20% of total specialty spend. So the next two to three years will be very telling in terms of how much interchangeability comes to market, how much we're able to move customers over, et cetera. And we're very excited about the prospect to generate affordability for benefit of our clients and customers, and ultimately capture a piece of that value in terms of our economic model. It will be just four weeks from today. Actually we have our Investor Day. And in that time period Eric Palmer is going to spend a little more time talking about biosimilars and how that links into our financial picture. So I don't want to necessarily front-run that conversation, but we'll give you more detail at that time in terms of how to think about that contextually in the sense of our longer-term Evernorth growth expectations. Operator : Thank you, Goldwasser. Our final question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question. Dave Windley : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have a two-parter on commercial membership. I'm wondering if consolidation of slice business is a theme in your target customer base if you're seeing that and if is or can be a beneficiary of that? And then I'm also wondering as Medicaid redeterminations turn on, presuming they do, can Cigna be a beneficiary or catch Medicaid members moving into commercial, or is that difficult because you don't have them in the Medicaid book? David Cordani : Dave, good morning, it's David. I'll take both your questions. First, I would not call out the slice phenomenon, whether it's slicing or consolidate as a major driver specifically, as it relates to 2022. The phenomenon transpires as clients look for additional value, and as they seek additional value. I'd underscore though a little bit of a subset here that may be inferred in your question. As we've all learned throughout the prolonged pandemic where people live and work continues to be more fluid than ever. Hence having the seamless network access care coordination and service capabilities that are truly national, and again, seamless remains a differentiator. And like a few -- I'm not going to say, Cigna is no one like a few that proposition I think is even more important today than ever before in terms of supporting the marketplace. But I would not call it the slice phenomenon is unique. As it relates to the Medicaid redeterminations first in our 2022 outlook or our multiyear strategy stand today we do not have a big uptake that would be planned for relative to redeterminations. We do think we'll be a net beneficiary. There'll be some that plays through. And whether it shows up in our IFP or exchange business or in our commercial portfolio through the mechanisms in which people access care or services we do believe that we'll see some opportunity in it but we do not have that factored into our outlook. And we do not believe that you have to be a Medicaid player to benefit from that. We've seen seamlessness of individuals moving over a prolonged period of time even pre-pandemic between programs. So that phenomenon as it relates to the redetermination and the way in which people seamlessly move between either Medicaid and exchange or whether they move between Medicaid through a redetermination now to a broader commercial population we do not see Medicaid as a gate. So that presents some potential upside for us going forward. Dave Windley : Fair. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Windley. I'll now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : Again thank you for joining our call today. Just to reinforce a few points, we achieved strong results in the first quarter and we're stepping into the rest of 2022 with momentum. We're confident that we will deliver our increased EPS outlook of at least $22.60 for 2022. Our performance is a direct result of the hard work, dedication and passion of our more than 70,000 coworkers across our company who work every day to change people's life for the better. Our actions are also guided by our drive to make healthcare more affordable predictable and simple for our clients and our customers as well as our patients. We look forward to talk to you more next month at our Investor Day about our vision for the future and the progress we're making in driving a meaningful impact for those we serve as well as our long-term sustained growth outlook. Hope you have a great rest of your day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes Cigna's first quarter 2020 results review.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead, Mr. Giacobbe. Ralph Giacobbe : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, Cigna's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian are going to cover a number of topics, including Cigna's second quarter 2022 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for the year. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2022 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties and is contained in the cautionary note of today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the second quarter, we recorded after-tax special item charges of $26 million or $0.08 per share for integration and transaction-related costs and $17 million or $0.05 per share related to a strategic plan to further leverage the company's ongoing growth to drive operational efficiency. We also recorded an after-tax special item benefit of $20 million or $0.06 per share associated with litigation matters. As described in today\u2019s earnings release, Special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2022 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2022 dividends and excludes the impact of any business combinations or divestitures that may occur after today. As a reminder, we completed the sale of our international life accident and supplemental businesses to Chubb on July 1, which is contemplated in our prospective statements. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. In the second quarter, our company continued delivering differentiated value for our clients, customers, patients and partners as we execute on our mission to improve the health, well-being and peace of mind of those we serve. And we posted strong results for the quarter and continue to build on our momentum from the first quarter. Now today, I'll briefly discuss our quarterly performance and the key strategic drivers of our growth, then Brian will review additional details about our financial results during the quarter, our increased outlook for the rest of 2002 as well as our strong capital position. and then we'll take your questions. Let's get started. In the second quarter, we delivered total revenues of $45.5 million and adjusted EPS of $6.22 per share. Our differentiated capabilities and innovative approaches are resonating in the market, and we achieved another quarter of strong performance across our growth platforms. In Evernorth, we're pleased with the way our solutions are continuing to gain traction with health plans, large commercial employers, governmental agencies, health care delivery systems and medical professionals. Today, more than 180 million individual customers have access to our Evernorth solutions. We're also encouraged by our progress during the selling season for 2023, and we are on track for another year of high client retention levels. In Cigna Healthcare, our disciplined execution is driving a balance of sustained customer growth and continued progress with expanding margins. Our medical care ratio during the quarter was 80.7%, which was better than expected and a substantial improvement over the same period last year. Similar to last quarter, we continue to see a positive impact from the targeted pricing and affordability actions we put in place last year and in early 2022. Overall results during the first half of the year, including the strength of our ongoing performance give us confidence in delivering our increased full year 2022 EPS guidance of at least $22.90. Additionally, we recently completed the divestiture of our life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses in 6 markets across Asia Pacific to Chubb, and we launched a $3.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program. At current levels, we view this as an attractive use of our capital. When combined with our previously completed activity, we remain on track to repurchase at least $7 billion of our shares in 2022. Overall, we delivered a strong first half of 2022, and we are positioned to deliver on our increased outlook for revenue, customer growth and EPS for this year. Our performance is a direct result of our ability to leverage our expertise, capabilities and ongoing commitment to innovation, all focused on the most pressing needs of those we serve. Affordability remains first and foremost, a top need for all of our stakeholders. In response to this, we continue to drive target innovations, including, for example, a new solution launched in June that leverages our capabilities at eviCore to support post-acute care for Cigna Medicare Advantage patients. As the patient prepares for a discharge from a hospital, our team draws upon the extensive evidence-based guidelines as well as analytics we have to work closely with providers and patients. The result is that we're able to determine the most appropriate site of care and services to support a patient's recovery, which improves health outcomes, drives meaningful cost savings and provides better patient experience and satisfaction. We've also launched a number of programs that address the rising costs of vital medications. Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth's patient assurance program is an industry-first innovation capping out-of-pocket costs for insulin. In 2021 alone, we provided more than $42 million of financial relief to approximately 220,000 patients with diabetes. We've continued to broaden the impact of this program by expanding it to other chronic conditions drawing on the strength of our expertise as well as our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Building on the success of this program, last month, our U.S. commercial business introduced Cigna Pathwell Specialty, a new approach to specialty care. Pathwell Specialty leverages our specialty capabilities in Cigna and Evernorth and provides enhanced support to patients for better outcomes while also controlling rising specialty costs. We plan to extend this offering to additional groups of clients later this year. At our Investor Day in June, we talked about how we're able to consistently deliver sustained attractive healthy growth even in challenging economic environments. Our company is built to perform in a variety of market conditions, including economic slowdowns. It starts with our growth framework that positions us to expand our addressable markets and capture value in 3 specific ways. First, foundational growth. to our businesses that are mature, scaled and contribute steady predictable results for our company. These businesses currently contribute about 60% of our annual revenue and include Express Scripts, U.S. commercial and our international health business. Second is accelerated growth for our businesses with differentiated capabilities aided by secular trends creating very attractive addressable markets. These businesses represent about 40% of our company's revenues, and we expect to grow these further with momentum from our specialty pharmacy and care services businesses within Evernorth and our U.S. government business in Cigna Healthcare. And third, cross-enterprise leverage, where businesses work together to create value and capture more value than any one of them could achieve on the road. Putting it all together, this growth framework translates into continued strong top and bottom line contributions from Evernorth. Our health service platform continues to providing industry-leading pharmacy solutions while also building out our Evernorth Care capabilities to address the growing demand for behavioral services, health coaching and care delivery. Evernorth strengthens our ability to support customers and clients with the forces facing and reshaping health care today, including the significant societal shift, bringing widespread and growing recognition of the connection between mental and physical health. This has resulted, for example, in a rising demand for services, and we've continued to expand our traditional network. For example, Evernorth behavioral network has more than doubled in size over the past 5 years. We're also supporting enhanced services by providing virtual care. Recently, we launched Confide Behavioral Health Navigator to improve the way we guide people to the right behavioral care at the right setting at the right time. We also have an extensive and growing portfolio of solutions, supporting both virtual and digital first solutions, including our MDLive platform. For Cigna Healthcare, our growth framework translates into strong performance driven by ongoing customer growth in U.S. commercial as we continue to improve affordability in key geographies, including through advancing our value-based care and site of care service programs. Also accelerating Cigna Healthcare's adoption of Evernorth Solutions, which creates even greater value for our customers and clients and as a driver of attractive sustainable revenue growth for Evernorth. In International Health, following the divestiture of our International Life accident and supplemental benefits portfolio, we are intensifying our focus on health and health service offerings. And in U.S. government, both for Medicare Advantage and individual family plans, we are delivering strong value for those we serve while we're investing in markets where we see sustained path for growth and a clear right to win over the long term. This balance and diversified approach to growth, together with our substantial capital generation affords us a significant level of strategic and financial flexibility that positions us for sustained, differentiated growth under a variety of scenarios. Now to wrap up. We delivered on our customer client commitments in the first half of the year. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to drive continued attractive healthy growth across our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms by leveraging our portfolio of foundational assets, accelerated growth businesses and fueled by the power of our cross-enterprise leverage. We are encouraged by our strong retention outlook for the start of 2023 as well as new business wins for the start of the year. We remain on track for continued delivery of our commitments. And as a result, we are increasing our full year outlook to at least $22.90 per EPS, which represents a growth rate of 12%, which is within our long-term average annual adjusted EPS growth target of 10% to 13%. We\u2019re continuing to deliver significant value for our shareholders, and we expect to deliver at least $7 billion through share repurchase in 2022 as well as continue to pay a meaningful dividend. We also continue to make strategic investments to strengthen our capabilities and broaden our reach in both our foundational and accelerated growth businesses. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian. Brian Evanko : Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter 2022 results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year. We have delivered strong customer revenue and earnings growth in the first half of 2022. Continuing our momentum from the first quarter, with second quarter earnings per share exceeding our expectations. With that, we are again increasing our full year adjusted 2022 earnings outlook to at least $22.90 per share, representing growth of 12% off of our reported full year 2021 adjusted EPS. This updated outlook reflects the strength of our foundational and accelerated growth businesses, coupled with cross enterprise leverage between Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Looking at the quarter specifically, some key consolidated financial highlights include total revenues of $45.5 billion, After-tax adjusted earnings of $2 billion, representing growth of 10% over second quarter 2021 and adjusted earnings per share of $6.22. These results reflect a better-than-expected medical care ratio in Cigna Healthcare and continued strong performance within our Evernorth portfolio. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Second quarter 2022 adjusted revenues grew 7% over second quarter 2021 to $34.9 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion in line with our expectations. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by the expansion of our accelerated growth businesses, led by our high-performing specialty pharmacy as well as a continued focus on affordability by delivering lowest net cost solutions for our clients and customers. We also continue to make meaningful strategic investments to both sustain and create new sources of differentiation. These include investments which serve to deepen our client relationships, develop new solutions and enhanced digital capabilities to expand our services in the Evernorth Care business. Overall, Evernorth continues to deliver strong results, consistent with our expectations. Turning to Cigna Healthcare. Second quarter 2022 adjusted revenues were $11.3 billion, Pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.2 billion, and the medical care ratio was 80.7%. The better-than-expected medical care ratio in the quarter, was the primary driver of Cigna Healthcare's earnings results exceeding our expectations. The strength in our MCR was driven by a combination of strong pricing actions taken over the past 12 months, our continued affordability initiatives to lower cost for our clients and lower-than-expected utilization within the quarter. Non-COVID costs in the quarter were better than expectations across most service categories driven by lower levels in inpatient, emergency room care and surgeries and direct COVID costs were also lower than projected. Importantly, leveraging our customer engagement model, we are seeing preventive care utilization in line with pre-pandemic levels, including items such as annual exams, colonoscopies and mammograms. Turning to medical customers. We ended the quarter with 17.8 million total medical customers, growth of approximately 725,000 customers or 4% year-to-date. Our select market segment within U.S. commercial has already grown 6% year-to-date and remains on track for high single-digit growth in customers by the end of the year. Total medical customers for the quarter were above our expectations as we've seen continued growth and strong retention in our U.S. commercial and international health businesses. Overall, Cigna Healthcare results reflect continued execution against our commitment to increasing both customer relationships and profit margins in 2022. The margin improvement reflects our pricing actions and affordability initiatives taken over the course of the past year. For Corporate and other operations, the second quarter 2022 pre-tax adjusted loss was $168 million. Overall, we delivered strong second quarter financial results that exceeded our expectations, continuing our momentum with contributions across our diversified portfolio. Now with respect to our outlook for full year 2022, we are increasing our outlook for full year adjusted revenue and adjusted earnings per share. In Evernorth, we expect continued strong execution driving attractive top and bottom line growth, all while investing in innovation for the future. We are now raising our Evernorth full year adjusted earnings to approximately $6.125 billion. In Cigna Healthcare, we are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2022, and we are now updating our 2022 medical care ratio outlook to 81.5% to 82.5%, an improvement from our prior range. We are also raising our expected full year 2022 adjusted earnings outlook to approximately $4.025 billion. And we are raising our medical customer outlook to growth of at least 800,000 customers, which includes strong new business growth and attractive retention levels in our foundational U.S. commercial and international health businesses. Turning to enterprise revenue. We now expect full year 2022 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $178 billion. Enabled by continued growth and deepening of customer and client relationships in both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Our full year 2022 SG&A ratio is now expected to be in the range of 7.1% to 7.3%, an increase compared to our prior guidance as we continue to make strategic investments in our business. Taken as a whole, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to be at least $22.90 per share, representing growth of 12% over reported full year 2021 adjusted EPS. Now moving to our 2022 capital management position and outlook. Our businesses continue to generate strong cash flows and attractive returns on capital. Year-to-date, as of June 30, 2022, we have repurchased 9.7 million shares for approximately $2.3 billion. Additionally, in July, we received an initial delivery of 10.4 million shares of our common stock in accordance with the accelerated share repurchase we announced in June. We also continue to expect to deploy at least $7 billion to share repurchases for the full year 2022. We have also increased our outlook for full year cash flow from operations to at least $8.5 billion, generating a very attractive cash flow yield. And we now expect full year weighted average shares of 312 million to 314 million shares, representing an increase of 1 million shares at the midpoint from our prior guidance, primarily due to the sale of our international life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses being completed slightly later than we originally had anticipated. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our efficient asset-light framework that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. Now we would be remiss if we didn't acknowledge the macroeconomic environment, which carries potential risks but also opportunities. We have a strong and resilient enterprise with a diverse service-based framework, spanning broad addressable markets. And our first half results demonstrate the resiliency of our portfolio and strength of our execution in a dynamic environment. We continue to proactively prepare with a variety of actions and tools to respond to evolving economic conditions and we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow and deliver strong value to our customers, clients and shareholders. Now to recap. Results in the second quarter were above our expectations, reflecting strong fundamentals across our diversified portfolio, with particularly strong performance in Cigna Healthcare. Evernorth continues to deliver attractive results, while Cigna Healthcare continues to grow and expand both customer relationships and margins, giving us the confidence to deliver on our increased 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of at least $22.90. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Matthew Borsch : Yes. So I was wondering if you could just maybe elaborate a bit on the strong selling season or new sales that you alluded to along with high retention. Is that covering both the U.S. medical large employer group and also the PBM outlook? David Cordani : It's David. So yes, is the simple answer. So relative to my comments on the selling season, more specifically focused on the -- both in the Evernorth side of the house, the large employer, a large health plan side of the business. In the commercial side, the national account side of the business. So headline there is on the Evernorth piece of the equation. Another year of strong client retention overall for the portfolio as well as attractive new business wins. I think importantly to underscore as well, we continue to see traction of what we call enterprise leverage. So opportunities to deepen and expand relationships. First, within the traditional Evernorth portfolio, the successful renewal of the DoD also presented the opportunity to win and secure the exclusive specialty services. And then beyond that, we\u2019re broadening and deepening relationships with key health plan clients by leveraging the best of Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. On the commercial national account side, we see 2023, looking up to be a very strong retention year and some really attractive new business adds. So good, good performance on both sides of the equation. As Brian noted in his prepared remarks, also just continued strong performance in the commercial side of the Select segment. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin Fischbeck : I want to understand how you guys are thinking about the outperformance on the medical cost side as it relates to kind of getting back to target margins. Are you guys viewing the outperformance so far this year is kind of a new sustainable base? Or is this just kind of fluctuations of COVID hasn\u2019t really changed how you thought about moving from 2021 to 2023 pricing and margin expectations? Brian Evanko : Kevin, it's Brian. So thanks for the question on the Cigna Healthcare margin trajectory. Just to maybe rewind the clock a little bit. If you look back at 2021, that part of our business generated a margin of 8.1% which was below our long-term margin goal of 9% to 10%. And when we stepped back and thought about where we stood in '21, we decided to intensify a series of pricing actions as well as affordability actions in the middle part of the year and the last 12 months have resulted in the strong performance that we saw here in the second quarter of 2022. With our increased 2022 outlook, we're now projecting for the profit margin in Cigna Healthcare to run in the high 8%, just south of 9% relative to our long-term margin goal of 9% to 10%. You should view that as a sustainable place to jump off of. And we would expect, as we step into '23 that we'll be able to deliver within our targeted margin range of 9% to 10% for Cigna Healthcare, but likely at the lower end of that range, given the continued long-term margin opportunities we have in the accelerated growth platforms such as Medicare Advantage. But the stronger-than-expected 2022 performance we\u2019ve seen increases our overall confidence in executing against our margin goals while also reducing a little bit of the year-over-year opportunity for further margin expansion opportunity in comparison to where we stood a quarter ago. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. JoshRaskin: I just wanted to focus on Medicare Advantage, seeing a little bit of attrition continued this year. And so now with bids submitted. What are some of the action steps directly for 2023 to reverse those losses? Do you think you can grow more in line with the market next year? And specifically, any changes in your network development or thoughts on value-based care and capitation? David Cordani : Josh, it's David. So our Medicare Advantage business remains a key point of focus for us. And as you recall from our Investor Day conversation, we view it as one of our accelerate platforms. So a platform where we have the opportunity for outsized growth over the long term. We continue to make investments in that business, both in the core aspects of the business as well as in the geographic expansion. Our 2022 results are not indicative of what we would expect to see over the long term. And importantly, in your question, which I think you touched upon insightfully one of the pieces, we did a bit of network reconfiguration to put us in some key markets in a position for longer-term growth, where we had attractive network positions, but not growth outlook from that standpoint. Shifting to '23, we would expect a year of growth to reaccelerate for ourselves in the Medicare Advantage business. As we discussed, that date by in geography growth today, existing geographies beginning to leverage the hard work that was done in 2021 and in '22 in terms of geographic expansion. Targeted and further investments in distribution and marketing as well as beginning to harness more yield out of what we think about in terms of our inside or more captive opportunities. Those are commercial agents that we talked about before, where we\u2019ve had a low conversion rate, our PDP conversions or a med sup conversions. So headline, yes, some network reconfiguration, a lot of that was addressed in this current year, harnessing the benefit of the geographic expansion work that was done and then harnessing some benefits that we would expect to see out of the channels I made reference to. Therefore, we expect 2023 to be a year of growth for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Dave Windley with Jefferies. Dave Windley : A follow-up to Josh there. Wondered if, David, with those expectations for growth in MA you expect to do that while maintaining margin? Or would you \u2013 to stimulate growth, expect margin to back up in MA at all? And then if you could remind us how your Star scores in MA will progress over the next couple of years and if the disaster relief benefits to the calculation were impactful for Cigna or not? David Cordani : So as Brian made reference to in the prior answer, I think it was to Kevin's point relative to Cigna Healthcare margins. He referred to the Medicare Advantage margins as being below our target margin. So as we grow the margin in the overall portfolio of business. That business is running at below target margins. We would expect to see margin improvement in 2023, to be very specific off of 2022's results and be able to grow although that portfolio will run below our target margins for a variety of reasons, including our investments in growth initiatives looking forward. But specifically, we expect growth and some margin expansion in that business, yet it will run below our target as we continue to invest in growing that portfolio. As it relates to the second part of your question, and Stars, I think you\u2019re identifying the phenomenon for 2024 first off of the present. We feel really good about our present Star configuration and the strong value that, that reinforces that we provide. To look for 2024 seems to indicate that the industry as a whole will have some Stars dislocation for the reasons you articulated. The disaster release configuration, the prolonged impact of COVID, the data transfer that comes across with that and the changes within the disaster release program. So we would expect to have some adjustment to our Stars consistent with what transpires for the industry at large. And obviously, that will become clear towards the latter part of this year for the industry as a whole as well as for ourselves. Operator : Our next question comes from Ms. Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Unidentified Analyst : This is Michael on for Ricky. I just wanted to get some more comments on your commercial repricing efforts. Clearly, you're doing improved MLR performance year-to-date. Membership growth peers healthy, which suggests stickiness, positive receptivity here from pricing. I'm just curious on your thoughts about where is Cigna in your overall targeted repricing efforts? David Cordani : Michael, it's David. Let me just briefly start and hand it over to Brian. First, to underscore, we're quite pleased with the results. Our teams are executing quite well. And Brian will come across the pricing, but he underscored in his prepared remarks as well, the affordability. It's 2 dimensions working together. So -- it's getting first and foremost, consultatively the right solutions in place, employer by employer within all of our segments, whether they're select segment employers. What the market knows is middle market employers were national account employers and then it's executing the right affordability initiatives to be able to give -- deliver the right value and then executing from a pricing standpoint. So I want to underscore, it\u2019s both of those pieces coming together to create the sustainability and our attractive underlying both retention and new business growth, coupled with the margins we\u2019re quite pleased with. Brian, I\u2019ll ask you to speak a little bit more towards the pricing dimension. Brian Evanko : Sure, David. As it relates to pricing in the commercial book of business, this year's 2022 medical care ratio performance has resulted in a higher margin profile for Cigna Healthcare, and that's driven largely by our commercial employer book of business. So we\u2019ve recaptured a bit more margin in 2022 than we originally anticipated. The good news is that means there\u2019s less correction that\u2019s needed on a prospective basis. So we\u2019ll certainly be pricing to our forward look at cost trend as we head into 2023, but we don\u2019t need a meaningful step change as it relates to the commercial employer margin profile. The one nuance in that is our stop-loss portfolio as we talked about in our fourth quarter results did have some pressure in 2021. That pressure has continued at the level we expected in 2022. So as we step into \u201823, there will be a little bit of a reprice on some of those clients but we were able to get, again, more margin recapture here in \u201822 than we had anticipated in the commercial employer book of business. Operator : And this question comes from Mr. A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. A.J. Rice: Maybe just following up on talking about the selling season and what you're seeing out there. I guess employers are faced with a lot of cross currents macroeconomic questions. Obviously, their own labor issues, questions about providers wanting relief on their labor challenges and other inflationary costs. How are those playing into the discussions? I wondered what innovative products that are \u2013 wood products are particularly resonating. And also, one of your peers said that they were seeing some people postpone full-blown RFPs just given everything that\u2019s going on and maybe delaying it for a year. Would you characterize the selling activity as is pretty normal? Or are you seeing any of that? David Cordani : It's David. So I think the dimension to your question first on the second piece, we see a very active pipeline. We've seen an active pipeline. As I noted previously, our retention results have been strong and importantly, underscoring even in 2022, commented relative to 23 start. But in '22, our retention results are strong even with the rate execution that Brian made reference to. So good retention within our portfolio, quite an active pipeline across various aspects of our business. On the first part of your question, it's a really long conversation. Let me boil it down. There's no doubt that the environment remains dynamic, disrupted, challenging from an employer standpoint to be able to attract, retain, have the engagement levels for their coworkers. A couple of phenomenons I would underscore to your point. One, in the prolonged pandemic environment, employers are dealing with, call it, the nomadic lifestyle of more of their employees. So first and foremost, on the commercial side, truly having a seamless commercial network for their employees because the higher percentage of the coworkers are consuming care in various locations as opposed to more traditional or centralized locations geographically. Secondly, seeking to advance as aggressively as possible, behavioral health services and the connection of behavioral health services with physical health services. And I highlighted several of those in my prepared remarks. That remains front and center. Third, on the cost and the affordability side of the equation, open-mindedness even push to more aggressively adopt whether they\u2019re site of care optimization programs. So how do you get better affordability with existing even improve quality by optimizing site of care for an individual patient or bringing more services closer to the individual, both dealing with the nomadic lifestyle as well as site of care, virtual digital-first, closer intimacy. And those are areas that have been high on strategy for us. So you\u2019re correct. There\u2019s a lot of dynamism in the marketplace today, being consultative in terms of putting the right solution suite together, mission-critical, having the services between our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare portfolio mission-critical right now and then being able to optimize that national network, the site of care optimization kind of the multimodal virtual coordinated care is mission-critical right now. A.J., I hope that helps. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : I wanted to talk about the $22.90 this year. You've answered some of the questions in terms of the commercial business specifically. But just in terms of the jump-off point for 2023 earnings, anything we should think about in terms of whether this may or may not be a reasonable starting point versus that 10% to 13% target growth? And then any headwind tailwinds you want us to consider when thinking about that 10% to 13% kind of target digging into next year? Brian Evanko : Justin, it's Brian. I'll start and then, David, I think maybe we'll chime in on the headwinds, tailwinds component. At a macro level, you should not think of there being massive amounts of nonrecurring items favorable or unfavorable in the 2022 performance. So you should view the $22.90 is a reasonable jump-off point. As we look back at prior year development, which has been largely in line with prior calendar years, the amount of activity we're seeing in the second quarter, Cigna Healthcare book of business as it relates to fundamental strength is quite high. So meaning there\u2019s not any meaningful things we\u2019d call out that are substantial, and that would be 2022 specific for purposes of doing those adjustments at this point in time. That could change as the year unfolds. But broadly speaking, I jump off to $22.90. David, do you think about with a tailwind, do you want to jump in on that, please? David Cordani : Sure, Brian. Thanks. And Brian, maybe under your point. Therefore, we seldom talk through about a rebasing framework, Justin. As it relates to headwind tailwinds, we would typically go through that in more detail on the third quarter call and then detailed guidance in the fourth quarter call, but maybe a step back to, as you may recall from Investor Day, we talked about a few of the more macro opportunities for 2023. So first and foremost, think about foundational and fundamental growth across our businesses. As we commented today, we would expect another year of growth for the organization, both on the Cigna Healthcare side of the equation as well as Evernorth side of the equation. Secondly, a topic we have not discussed here, but we discussed previously at Investor Day we would expect to see further contributions from the biosimilar trend, which will begin to accelerate 2023, accelerate further in 2024, but some contribution of the biosimilar trend, of which we are well positioned and configured to deliver value for our clients, customers and patients on as well as benefit for our shareholders. On the headwind side, just to give illustrations, we\u2019ve highlighted set up \u2013 what we call setup costs for very large clients, whether they\u2019re very large client renewals or expansions. There\u2019s a set of costs in a gestation cycle relative to that. And then lastly, the rate and pace of our strategic investments that we choose to make given the rapid changes in the environment may create a little bit more headwind year-over-year, which we would highlight. But net-net, we would expect another positive year for 2023, off of what is shaping up to be a very strong year for 2022. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Gary Taylor with Cowen. Gary Taylor : Just want to ask a little more about medical loss ratio, which was so favorable. So congrats on that. But just a few different questions, if I could. One, the sequential decline in 2Q is pretty unusual for your books seasonality. I know we have international health care in there now, and I'm just wondering if that contributes to any different view of seasonality sequentially from 1Q, 2Q? Also a year ago, you had highlighted behavioral and substance abuse is putting a lot of pressure on 2Q. I just wondered if that's changed at all? And then also just on stop-loss, you had talked about still believing that would be a pressure all the way through \u201822 with pricing initiatives having more effect in \u201823. So just wondering, are you producing this strong MLR on the lower-than-expected utilization still with stop-loss being a bit of a headwind inside of it? Brian Evanko : Gary, it's Brian. I'll do my best to take each of those components of your question. And I appreciated the lead-in that you started with there. We are really pleased with the strength in the medical care ratio in the second quarter. So and it really was a fundamental strength across the portfolio with our U.S. commercial employer book really being the primary driver of the strength. And as I mentioned earlier in my comments, we saw favorability both in non-COVID and in COVID-related costs in the quarter. So strength in both parts of that portfolio, again, which reflects our affordability initiatives as well as a lesser utilization than we had been forecasting. As it relates to the sequential decline, you should not think of the international health business as a material driver of that. This was really a quarter we had favorable cost experience relative to our prior expectations, as opposed to anything unique or nuanced by adding the international book in there. As it relates to behavioral health, you're right, last year, we saw higher than typical cost trends in our behavioral health book of business, which we actually viewed as a good thing from the standpoint of people getting the care that they needed. That's moderated a bit here in 2022, meaning the cost trends we're seeing on behavioral are lower than they were in 2021. And as a result of that, that's provided a little bit of quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year favorability. And then finally, on your point about stop-loss, as I mentioned on the earlier question that Michael asked, the 2022 stop-loss MCR performance is largely in line with our expectations. So when we reset the 2021 MCR pick at the end of the year, given the pressure we saw, we had said we would not be able to reprice most of the '22 book just given the timing of when that emerged. And so that's our expectation. That's what we're seeing in the actual. So the MCR outlook for '22 and stop off very similar to the MCR outlook for '21, which gives us a repricing opportunity in 2023. So you kind of step back from all of this and the favorability we're seeing in commercial is largely not stop loss related. It's largely related to the non-COVID and the COVID-related cost on first dollar coverages and our fully insured and other risk businesses. Operator : Our next question comes from Ms. Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : I just wanted to follow up with a couple of questions around the PBM. So, one. When we think about the selling season, David, you talked about very strong retention. Should I assume that, that's in the very high 90% range? Would be first. Second, as we think about -- you talked about biosimilars, we think about plan design for 2023, are you starting to put biosimilars on the formulary in 2023? We'll see that impact in '23? Or will this really be more of a '24 opportunity? And then just lastly, there\u2019s been some changes on the manufacturing side for 340B. I didn\u2019t hear you call that out as a headwind. I\u2019m just curious if you had any headwinds as it pertains to 340B and the Express Scripts book of business? David Cordani : Lisa, it's David. You packed a lot in there. So let me try to run through them. First, from a retention standpoint, think about 95-plus. We believe anything in the mid-90s plus is a quite strong result given the diversity of our business for that portfolio. And as I noted on the prior comment, in addition to that, think about us continuing to deepen the relationships we have with broadening of services. As I noted, whether it's adding specialty exclusive or otherwise as well as the enterprise leverages, we have some relationships that are becoming deeper with leveraging Cigna Healthcare capabilities for legacy Evernorth relationships or vice versa. But think retention, 95-plus is something that we view as quite attractive. As it relates to the biosimilars, your specific question on formulary that finalization typically takes place as we approach the fourth quarter. So the dynamism being managed through. And as you know, with your background relative to the space, there's a lot of dynamism relative to that as it relates to choice client by client as well. We think about our national preferred formulary finalization more approaching the fourth quarter versus in the current dynamic and time frame. And specific to the timing of the opportunity, as we discussed previously, I would think about the biosimilar acceleration. While there's some movement, obviously, in 2022, '23 is active year with fixation and focus on HUMIRA and the transition. That will begin to ramp in 2000 and contributions will begin to ramp in 2023, but accelerate much further in '24 and obviously going to '25. Lastly, relative to 340B. As folks know, 340B is a really important program that a lot of health care delivery systems benefit from as they serve disadvantaged and underserved populations to help them get the right level of affordability. There's been some dislocation in that program and some pharmaceutical manufacturers have you lately decided to stop or decrease or create tension for health care delivery systems participation in that. As it relates to Cigna specifically through our Evernorth portfolio, it\u2019s not a material driver of 2022 results, hence, we didn\u2019t call it out. Any change or disruption, and that is not a material driver to 2022 results from that standpoint, although there\u2019s been some activity, and we\u2019ve seen some deceleration in volume as some of the data transfer tension has grown. We\u2019ve seen that a little bit trough in the second quarter, and we see emergence of some improvement or acceleration in those activities in the beginning of the third quarter here as we work with health care delivery systems to try to help them get the data across that pharmaceutical manufacturers are challenging them to deliver. But again, not a material driver for us thus far, Lisa. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Kevin Caliendo : I guess I\u2019d like to ask about sort of potential drug price legislation. That looks like it may actually pass this time in Congress. So I was wondering if you\u2019ve taken a look at it and what the potential impact could be on Evernorth, either positively or negatively from what\u2019s being proposed? David Cordani : Kevin, it's David. You're correct, there's -- once again, some proposed legislation that's manifesting. And in the builders, there's orientation relative to pharmaceutical pricing. Stepping back, big picture, if you look at the breadth and the shape of our Evernorth portfolio as well as the diversification of services we have, both on the core pharmacy services, specialty pharmacy services, the innovation we've been able to bring to the market, the clinical programs we have, the significant amount of transparency we have with clients of a variety of choices. There is no item that we see currently in any of the proposed legislation that we view as a unique or a significant dislocation to our business. That doesn't mean there's not an environment of change. But back to managing the portfolio, the breadth of our services, the continued commitment to innovation, the evolution of our clinical programs, the evolution of our financing and funding mechanisms, affording choice to our commercial clients, health plan clients, et cetera, from that standpoint, positions us as we best see well even with the proposed legislation, and we continue to track the emergence of that day to day. Operator : Our next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich : I just wanted to ask a follow-up on some of the MLR commentary from earlier in the call. And I guess, specifically with regards to the outlook for the back half of the year, I guess, does the raise of the MLR outlook kind of embed any favorability in the back half? And I guess, have you seen any indications of any sort of pent-up demand? Or does sort of the macro environment that we\u2019re seemingly in, does that influence your view of how utilization might trend over the balance of the year? Brian Evanko : It's Brian. So as it relates to the MLR outlook for the back half of the year, so stepping back again in the second quarter, we saw a very favorable result relative to our prior expectations. And if you recall from our first quarter earnings release, we felt that it was prudent to assume that 2022 medical cost performance would look a lot like 2021 when you look at the all-in combined effect of COVID and non-COVID cost. So the terminology, if you recall, we would use the time would be above baseline. For purposes of the back half of the year, we have assumed that the medical cost performance will be largely consistent with our previous planning assumptions, meaning we have not assumed the second quarter favorability will run rate or extend through the back half of the year. So obviously, if the remaining 2 quarters were to run more in line with what we saw in the second quarter, there will be favorability in the second half of the year results from the standpoint of the MCR and as such, the income outlook. We\u2019re not yet seeing on the second part of your question, any meaningful signs of pent-up demand or acuity building in the book of business. So as I mentioned earlier, when we look at blood screenings, preventive exams, mammograms, colonoscopies, all of those on a per capita basis are very much in line with where they were in 2019, and we continue to see things like when cancers present the percentage that are metastatic is very consistent with where it was in 2019. And so the favorability we\u2019re seeing in the results, we don\u2019t attribute to a meaningful amount of care not being consumed that needs to be. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Stephen Baxter : Just wanted to follow up quickly on the MLR commentary you provided there. When we think about the upside in the quarter, I guess, any sense you can provide on how much of that was driven by favorable intra-year development versus your current period accruals? And then, as we think about the MLR progression through the balance of the year, I appreciate the commentary that you\u2019re expecting consistent with your prior planning cycle for above baseline utilization. Should we also be thinking about potentially a tailwind from midyear renewals that you wouldn\u2019t necessarily see in a typical year? And just remind us how much of your employer book reprices midyear? Brian Evanko : Stephen, it's Brian again. So relative to what we saw in the second quarter MCR, as I mentioned earlier, U.S. commercial was the primary driver of the favorability. Our government products largely ran in line with our expectations. And within the commercial employer book of business, we did have some favorability from first quarter reserve development, but that was the minority of the favorability in the experience. The primary driver were second quarter dates of service running favorable to our projections, which, again, is a function of both lower utilization than we expected, but also the affordability initiatives really holding -- or taking hold in the quarter. So we saw a strong site of care optimization in the quarter and other things such as that, helping to contribute to the favorable results in the quarter. As it relates to repricing for the balance of the year, the smaller part of our business, select segment tends to have a more even renewal date schedule as compared to our national accounts business, which tends to be very heavy 1/1. So you should think of on the select segment, about 2/3 of the clients have 1/1 effective dates and the other 1/3 have effective dates later in the year. So there is some opportunity for us to reprice that business that\u2019s been factored into our outlook in terms of the rate actions we have either already secured or intend to secure for the balance of the year. So that\u2019s been factored into the outlook and we\u2019ve been really pleased with the strong execution of our U.S. commercial team. We\u2019re delivering both improved margins and net customer growth in a challenging year. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : So within Evernorth, you mentioned the 2Q results were in line with our expectations. And I guess, and with both the top line, the bottom line growth year-over-year in Evernorth slowing a little bit -- really showing some slight deceleration year-over-year versus the growth in 1Q. Just wanted to give a little more color around that as far as what was baked in the expectations. I know last quarter, you talked about how you were continuing to make some meaningful strategic investments in Evernorth the expansion of client relationships. So I guess I\u2019m just curious how those investments may have progressed and impacted the results in the quarter for Evernorth. David Cordani : Steven, it's David. Just to the macro level, 2 points. One, we remain quite pleased with the overall performance of Evernorth and the sustained performance within Evernorth. Two, to your point, I give you caution in terms of triangulating any one quarterly pattern. You're correct, the rate and pace of the investments we're making. You made a reference relative to the Q-over-Q revenue growth, a little bit of the lumpiness in terms of the way the revenue manifests itself, for example, in Q1 and Q2 of last year. But the overall revenue trajectory and the overall earnings trajectory is quite helpful. Lastly, kind of pivoting down into your investment piece, we continue to make accelerated and growing investments within our accelerate platforms, 2 of those are within Evernorth, specifically the specialty pharmaceutical business through both Accredo and CuraScripts, but heavily targeted towards the Evernorth Care piece. We showcased some of the direction of that at our Investor Day and you should continue to expect to see us continue to ramp relative to that. So if there\u2019s any pattern or outside spending or investments that manifest itself beyond the large client set up costs, it\u2019s really the strategic investments we\u2019re making within our Evernorth care part of the equation today. Brian Evanko : Just one add for you, Steven, in terms of the modeling on the revenue side. In 2021, we had relatively steep sequential growth as it relates to the quarterly pattern of Evernorth revenue. A lot of that was driven by the onboarding of specific clients for our specialty programs. associated with the Prime Therapeutics relationship, the 2022 pattern is less steep, which is driving a little bit of the top line deceleration you made reference to. However, we\u2019ll see sequential growth in each quarter this year and we\u2019re on track for a strong year from a top and bottom line standpoint being in the range of our long-term goals for Evernorth. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Lance Wilkes : I wanted to ask about strategic capital allocation. And in particular, as you\u2019re looking at care delivery and value-based care, interested in just updates on the priority of that sort of initiative? And then you look at that as more of an enablement and something that could be cross-sold through Evernorth. Or is that also something that could be a driver for your Medicare Advantage, Cigna Healthcare sorts of businesses? David Cordani : It's David. Relative to the capital allocation and specifically coming to value-based care. And I want to, for a moment, just parse value-based care and care delivery ownership. As it relates to value-based care, we have a very longstanding commitment to and proven track record relative to value-based care. And for us, for starters, that means aligning incentives, leveraging clinical capabilities and working hand in glove with medical professionals to be able to deliver higher, more sustainable outcomes and value than otherwise can be done through a fee-for-service relationship. So today, we have a variety of programs underway with a little less than 50% of the overall equation in commercial being in a value-based care or reward-based configuration, conversely approaching 75% in Medicare Advantage. As it relates to the contribution of that, we see that as contributing to the great medical cost performance that Brian made reference to several times during the call. Now to your capital allocation and ownership configuration our orientation continues to be our preferred approach is to partner with and enable health care delivery systems for the way I just made reference to. However, in addition to that, if in key geographies, we believe the way in which to deliver the sustained outcome and approaches to own physical delivery of care. We will own, but that will be a geographic configuration for physical ownership. Added to that, in consistent, we seek to own care delivery assets that we believe are highly differentiated over the long term in terms of clinical capabilities as well as leverageable multi-geographic or nationally. What do I mean by that? Specialty pharmaceutical, behavioral health care, virtual care delivery are great examples of that. And Lance, going to the last part of your question, those services were more likely than not be Evernorth care capabilities that are offered to Cigna Healthcare commercial or Medicare Advantage, but also offered to the open broad marketplace from that same point and customized to the needs of large stand-alone employers, integrated delivery systems and health line clients. So you should expect as those programs continue to grow, they will be Evernorth care programs offer to Cigna Healthcare, but also offered broadly speaking, to the broad addressable market we have outside of Cigna Healthcare through Evernorth. Lance Wilkes : And could you just comment on your CareAllies and Cigna Medical Group capabilities? Are those in Evernorth? And would those be kind of integrated in with these sorts of efforts? Or are those focused on something else? David Cordani : Yes. It's great and credit to sneak a follow-on there. So take the second part of your piece, Cigna Medical Group is now Evernorth Care. It's an Evernorth Medical Group, it's rebranded as Evernorth, so it's the actions and the words line up from that standpoint. CareAllies remains currently focused intensely on the Cigna Healthcare portion in the Medicare Advantage portion and the value-based care relationships within our Medicare Advantage are currently in support of the MA only. So 2 different postures given the gestation of those programs, but the Cigna Co. Group is fully functioning as part of the Evernorth care platform today. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill : Yes. David, most of my questions have kind of been answered. I guess I would come back to the Evernorth segment and focus on the pharmacy network relationships. I guess I would ask, is there anything worth noting or any pressure points there as your pharmacy partners always seem to be under pressure and are looking for us to generate value? As it relates to pharmacy services or clinical value? So I guess just \u2013 it seems like we\u2019ve had stability in pharmacy network relationships for a while. Just wondering if there\u2019s anything there to talk about. David Cordani : George, it's David. There's nothing unique I would call out. That doesn't mean it's -- nothing is happening. As you referenced, it's a dynamic environment. But there's nothing unique I would call out, and our team continues to work with our pharmacy partners to make sure we get the right balance of access, accessibility, obviously, servicing clinical quality and affordability for our clients and our patients and customers. But no unique pattern or tension point or formation I would call out. Operator : Our last question comes from Mr. Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets. Ben Hendrix : I was wondering to what degree the MLR favorability ex-prior year development is unique within your commercial insured book? I guess I\u2019m wondering if the drivers of that favorability that you noted are also being realized by your ASO customers to the same degree? And to what extent that\u2019s helping retention? Brian Evanko : It's Brian. So as I think I mentioned in a prior question, the prior year development was not material to our results in the quarter. So you should kind of take that off of the list here in terms of considerations -- and the majority of the strength in the quarter in the medical care ratio was in the commercial employer book of business, which, by definition, would be the risk-oriented products. To your point, there is extensibility to our self-funded clients of course, because the same programs that are in place for our risk book are also utilized by many of our ASO and self-funded clients and the affordability initiatives span the entire Cigna Healthcare segment in many instances. David, do you want to pick up on the traction with the marketplace? David Cordani : Just to reinforce the linkage you created, the favorability, yields, lower medical cost trend and therefore, better affordability for our clients and that is a positive contributor to both retention as well as our ability to get responsible rate increases. It's also importantly not only a contributor to retention, when we're able to validate the value we were able to deliver it puts us in a position to deepen relationships, so to broaden services from that standpoint. But the linkage you created was absolutely correct. Operator : I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : First, thanks for everybody for joining our call today. And just to reiterate a few pieces, we built good momentum through the first quarter and we carried into the second quarter, and therefore, we're confident in our ability to deliver our increased EPS outlook of at least $22.90 for 2022 as well as our increased revenue and customer growth outlook. Additionally, before I close, I want to just pause and recognize and express my personal appreciation to our more than 70,000 coworkers who demonstrate through their continued focus and dedication and support our ability to deliver for all those we have the privilege to serve for our customers, our clients, our patients, our partners and ultimately, to convert that for you, our shareholders. We look forward to talking to you again soon about how we continue to advance our mission of improving health, well-being and peace of mind of those we serve and our continued approach to make health care services and solutions more affordable, predictable and simple. Thanks, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's Second Quarter 2022 Results Review.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by for Cigna's Third Quarter 2022 Results Review. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference including the Q&A session is being recorded.  We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead, Mr. Giacobbe. Ralph Giacobbe : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, Cigna's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's third quarter 2022 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2022. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2022 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent report filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the third quarter, we recorded after-tax special item charges of $23 million or $0.07 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. We also recorded an after-tax special item benefit of $1.4 billion or $4.52 per share associated with the sale of our international life accident and supplemental businesses to Chubb. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2022 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2022 dividends. With that, I'll turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Our team is performing well in a dynamic environment, and we delivered another strong quarter of revenue, earnings and cash flows. I'm going to spend a few minutes highlighting key drivers of our results in the third quarter and while we are once again raising our 2022 full year outlook for adjusted earnings per share as well as for growth in medical customers and enterprise revenues. Then I'll address how we continue to expand and enhance our capabilities for the evolving market needs, and I'll also provide some initial perspective relative to 2023. Brian will share more details about our third quarter results and our outlook for the rest of the year. Then we'll take your questions.  With that, let's get started. During the third quarter, we delivered results that were better than our expectations, including total revenues of $45.3 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $6.04. We continued building out our momentum this year, and we are confident we will deliver on our increased full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of at least $23.10. We also expect to continue advancing our capital deployment strategy, including investing in our business to drive innovation and growth and repurchasing at least $7 billion of our shares this year, all while paying a meaningful dividend. Our performance in the quarter reinforces the impact of our sustained commitment to service and innovation, our progress in retaining clients and expanding relationships with additional services as well as winning new business. Evernorth, our health service platform performed well again with solid top line and bottom line results driven by our market-leading innovation and affordability across our pharmacy benefit services, specialty pharmacy and Evernorth Care Solutions. Cigna Healthcare, our benefits portfolio also was key to continuing our momentum in the quarter. Our U.S. commercial business is having a very good year with solid client retention levels and new business wins, particularly in the middle market and select segments, leading us to once again raise our full year outlook for medical customers. Our medical care ratio for Cigna Healthcare was better than expectations at 80.8% in the third quarter demonstrating the effectiveness of our affordability initiatives and targeted pricing actions. Overall, we're very pleased with the third quarter results.  Now I'll take a few minutes to walk through how we are well positioned going forward with Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Within both platforms, we have differentiated businesses and a clear, durable three-part growth framework. First, through our foundational businesses, including our pharmacy benefit services, U.S. commercial and international health businesses. With these mature scale businesses, we established core relationships with corporate clients, health plans and governmental entities. Our capital-efficient operating models will further support steady growth as well as strategic and financial flexibility for our company. As we look ahead for these businesses, in 2023, pharmacy benefit services, we're expecting another year of high client retention levels complemented with new business wins. We're also very pleased with our solid start to the selling season for 2024, including our new multiyear agreement for Express Scripts to be the pharmacy benefits and specialty services provider for Centene. Working with Centene, we will make prescription drugs more affordable and accessible for approximately 20 million Centene members. The strategic collaboration with Centene builds on Express Scripts' track record as a partner of choice and will present growth opportunities to provide additional Evernorth Health services over time. We continue showing how we have a unique ability to partner across the health care landscape, expanding our reach and impact to more customers and patients, and with this new health plan relationship, we are building on our previous collaborations such as Prime Therapeutics, Oscar and Kaiser Permanente. For U.S. commercial, we are driving strong customer growth with wins throughout 2022, and enabled by our consultative sales approach and our affordability gains, enhancing more competitiveness in more geographies, all while maintaining ongoing pricing discipline. The sales and net growth in our National Accounts segment are solid and outpaced prior year results, and we are confident this momentum carries into 2023. And in international health, we are sharpening our health care focus for targeted growth opportunities in serving individuals, employers seeking healthy and productive employees and governmental entities that value our care management programs. We have momentum this year in customer growth, revenue and earnings and expect to sustain these results and performance throughout 2023. The second way we drive growth is through our Accelerate businesses, which include Accredo Specialty Pharmacy, Evernorth Care Services and our U.S. government business. These businesses have outsized opportunities to grow with compelling secular tailwinds and as well as differentiated capabilities that benefit our clients and customers. Looking forward for our Accelerate businesses, we continue to be excited about the value creation opportunities in specialty pharmaceuticals, including biosimilars over the next several years. With our leading capabilities and expertise, we expanded our relationship to be the exclusive specialty pharmacy provider for the Department of Defense starting in 2023. This is further reinforcement to how we fuel sustained long-term growth in Evernorth by improving clinical quality for the benefit of patients and achieving significant savings for our clients.  In Evernorth Care Services, we are advancing our care management and delivery strategies. One area of focus is enhancing virtual care that strengthens relationships between patients and their physicians to better anticipate health issues and intervene earlier. For example, with MDLIVE, we are providing better experiences and improved affordability with personalized care that is more convenient and effective in directing patients to the most appropriate care settings. When a person -- when in-person care is needed, MDLIVE successfully guide patients to urgent care facilities or other alternative sites to care, decreasing avoidable emergency room visits by at least 10%. We intend to further build on this progress by enhancing our virtual primary care offerings for patients with chronic conditions by providing continuous engagement with their physician, remote monitoring with connected devices and real-time interventions between appointments. In U.S. government, we are continuing to make investments, positioning us to grow in 2023 and beyond. We are strengthening this business by building on our high-quality affordable Medicare Advantage benefits we offer with geographic and network expansion as well as further product enhancements. Finally, the third way we drive growth is through a cross-enterprise leverage. Here, we harness capabilities across our company to accelerate innovation and have a greater impact than any individual could have on its own. Our opportunities here are driven in part by a rich longitudinal data and information we have to accelerate the development of new, more effective solutions for our clients and customers. Our Pathwell programs are a good example. With Pathwell Specialty, we're working across the medical and pharmacy benefits to reduce the cost of specialty infusions and injectables. In our Pathwell Bone and Joint program, we harness Evernorth digital navigation and advanced predictive analytical capabilities to reduce unnecessary musculoskeletal surgeries and provide better coordinated care. There is a significant addressable market for these programs as 50% of adults suffer from bone, joint and muscle conditions, and these are major drivers to U.S. healthcare costs. Additionally, we continue to take an enterprise view of our client relationships and successfully broaden and deepen them with our overall suite of capabilities. This has supported a number of attractive wins and a good example is a very large new fee-based relationship for 2023 in our U.S. commercial team that has secured this offering by bringing a solution to a longstanding Express Scripts client. With our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms and our growth framework, we anticipate driving another year of earnings, customer and revenue growth in 2023. We will provide detailed guidance as we always do on our fourth quarter earnings call. Having said that, I'll provide a view of some of the tailwinds and headwinds we see for 2023, which are largely consistent with the points we highlighted at our Investor Day in June. With a strong selling season, we anticipate a tailwind of continued growth across both our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms. We expect additional margin improvement in Cigna Healthcare and with our leading position in the rapidly growing specialty pharmaceuticals market will begin capturing value from biosimilars. Relative to anticipated headwinds, we will make meaningful strategic investments in our accelerated growth businesses. We will have additional costs as well as we prepare to support renewed and expanded relationships with the Department of Defense and Prime Therapeutics. And a new development since Investor Day is our exciting strategic win with Centene, which will create a one-year headwind as we onboard this new partner. Putting all that together, we anticipate that these tailwinds and headwinds will largely balance themselves off next year with the exception of our Centene headwind, which represents incremental cost for us in 2023. Now I'll briefly summarize. Overall, our strong performance in the quarter and throughout the year shows how we are addressing the most pressing needs of our customers and clients and growing our business. We're investing in innovation to enhance our capabilities for future growth and continue delivering for all of our stakeholders. We're confident we remain on track for our full year 2022 commitments, including our increased adjusted EPS guidance for this year of at least $23.10.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Evanko : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter 2022 results, and I'll discuss our updated outlook for the full year. We're proud of another strong quarter and are pleased to drive continued momentum from the first half of 2022, with third quarter adjusted earnings per share exceeding our expectations. With that, we are again increasing our full year adjusted 2022 earnings outlook to at least $23.10 per share, representing growth of 13% of our reported full year 2021 adjusted EPS. Looking at the quarter specifically, key consolidated financial highlights include total revenues of $45.3 billion, after-tax adjusted earnings of $1.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $6.04. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. We are pleased with the continued profitable growth in Evernorth, with our client-centric approach, deep pharmacy expertise and strong track record of service continues to resonate with new and existing clients. One good example of this is our recently announced partnership with Centene that will deliver greater prescription drug affordability and access for their approximately 20 million customers starting in January of 2024. This mutually beneficial partnership will bring significant revenue and will be financially accretive over the course of the multiyear contract term.  Turning to third quarter results for Evernorth. Revenues grew 6% over third quarter 2021 to $35.7 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.6 billion. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by continued expansion of our Accelerate growth businesses led by our specialty pharmacy, as well as our focus on affordability and delivering lowest net cost solutions for our clients and customers. We also continue to make meaningful strategic investments to both sustain and create new sources of differentiation. These include investments, which serve to deepen our client relationships and expand our services portfolio and digital capabilities. Overall, Evernorth delivered another quarter of strong results, consistent with our expectations. Turning to Cigna Healthcare. Our 2021 results presented an opportunity to expand future margins, and our team has executed extremely well and achieved both strong membership growth and improved profitability here in 2022. Third quarter 2022 performance continued this pattern as adjusted revenues were $11.2 billion, pretax adjusted earnings were $1.1 billion and the medical care ratio was 80.8%. Our medical care ratio was better than expectations and continues to demonstrate the impact of our affordability initiatives and pricing discipline. The favorable medical costs in the quarter were partially offset by lower net investment income. Turning to medical customers. We ended the quarter with 18 million total medical customers, growth of 873,000 customers or 5% year-to-date. We continue to drive strong customer and client growth in our U.S. commercial and international health businesses. Overall, Cigna Healthcare results reflect continued execution against our commitment to increasing both customer relationships and profit margins in 2022.  For corporate and other operations, the third quarter 2022 pretax adjusted loss was $299 million. As a reminder, this segment previously included our earnings contributions from the international life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses that we divested to Chubb on July 1, 2022. Overall, we delivered strong third quarter financial results that exceeded our expectations, continuing our momentum with contributions across our foundational and accelerated growth businesses. Now turning to our outlook for full year 2022. We have positioned the enterprise for continued strong performance in these dynamic times. As demonstrated by our strong year-to-date results and heightened reinvestment into our business. With that said, we remain mindful of the current economic backdrop and utilization environment heading into the upcoming winter months. In light of these moving pieces, we are increasing our outlook for full year adjusted revenue and adjusted earnings per share. We now expect full year 2022 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $179 billion, enabled by continued growth and deepening of customer and client relationships in both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. We are also raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to at least $23.10 per share, representing growth of 13% over reported full year 2021 adjusted EPS. In Cigna Healthcare, we expect to continue to grow customers while expanding margins over 2021. We are improving our expected 2022 medical care ratio outlook to 81.5% to 82.2%. We are raising our expected full year 2022 adjusted earnings to approximately $4.05 billion. And we are raising our medical customer growth expectation to approximately 900,000 customers, which reflects strong new business growth and attractive retention levels in our U.S. commercial and international health businesses. Our full year 2022 enterprise SG&A ratio is now expected to be approximately 7.3%, an increase compared to our prior guidance as we further accelerate investments into our business.  Now moving to our 2022 capital management position and outlook. Year-to-date through November 3, 2022, we expect to have repurchased approximately 22 million shares of common stock for $5.8 billion, including the accelerated share repurchase agreements announced in June. We also continue to expect to deploy at least $7 billion to share repurchases for the full year 2022. And during the third quarter, we delivered strong cash flow from operations of $3.3 billion. We remain on track for another strong year of cash generation, providing us the fuel and flexibility for ongoing capital deployment opportunities. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our asset-light framework that drives strategic flexibility, dollar margins and attractive returns on capital. Now to recap. Results in the third quarter were above expectations, reflecting strong growth across our diversified portfolio. Evernorth continues to deliver attractive results while Cigna Healthcare continues to grow and expand both customer relationships and margins. giving us confidence we will deliver on our increased 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of at least $23.10 per share. We remain well positioned and expect another year of customer, revenue and earnings growth in 2023. Relative to 2023, we deem the current consensus EPS to be reasonable when excluding the Centene contract win. Although consistent with our historical approach, our initial guidance would have likely started more prudently. As David mentioned, Centene implementation-related costs introduced a net new headwind for our 2023 financials. That said, we expect the two-year compounded EPS growth rate from 2022 to 2024 to be within our long-term average 10% to 13% annual range, driven by the strong earnings contribution from our broad portfolio as well as 2024 contributions from the Centene contract win, following the implementation cost impact that we will incur in 2023. We look forward to providing you with more detailed 2023 guidance during our fourth quarter call.  And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Stephen Baxter : I just wanted to ask you -- and congratulations on the Centene contract win. I wanted to ask specifically, is it too early to have a view on what you're expecting the implementation cost to be in 2023? It sounds like you're kind of suggesting that we should potentially add that back to 2023 to kind of create a jump-off point. Is it too early to think that 2024, we'll see the contract to be financially accretive? Basically, how should we be thinking about that? Is 2024 too early to think about accretion? Brian Evanko : Stephen, it's Brian. I appreciate the question very much. So maybe I'll give you a little bit of a flavor for the multiyear view here. So I'd be remiss if I didn't start by saying this is a huge win for the organization and a great validation of the value proposition in the Evernorth segment of our company, and in particular, the Express Scripts team did a great job partnering with our new client here. And we'll be laser-focused on successfully implementing the new client over the course of the next 14 months to ensure a smooth execution of their 20 million customers. And as I mentioned over the lifetime of the contract, the relationship will be accretive to our financials. But you should think of the profit margin percentage being below the book average as is typical for a contract of this size and scale. But in terms of the year-by-year pattern and how to think about that, you should think of 2023 being a headwind, as both David and I said, due to the implementation related costs that are incurred prior to any revenue being received. We're currently sizing that at about $200 million for the 2023 year. Given we're only a week or so into the contract award, we still have a lot of detailed planning to do to refine that. But that's our current best estimate for what 2023 implementation-related costs will look like. For 2024, we are currently expecting to be in a neutral to a small positive contribution standpoint in terms of the income. So you can think of that 2023 headwind essentially unwinding in the 2024 financials. And then for 2025 in the subsequent years, we would expect to be at approximately run rate contribution levels on the relationship. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. A.J. Rice : Maybe just to ask, I know last year or coming into '22, you made a comment that you wouldn't be doing any larger deals, and I think you define that as anything north of $10 billion in acquisitions. I wonder as you think about '23 now, a lot's changed over the course of the year. You've been very active on the share repurchase front. What is your current thinking about whether you'd be open to transactions? Any comment about priorities or the pipeline and what that looks like? And then the flip side, of course, is your ongoing share repurchase activity. When you're giving these '23 comments, do you have any sense of where you might size share repurchase activity and all of that? David Cordani : A.J., it's David. So let me provide a couple of landing points there. First, stepping back relative to our capital priorities, our capital priorities remain consistent, which is, first and foremost, to make sure the ongoing growth of the underlying business continues to be funded properly from a capital standpoint as well as from investments in innovation. Second, to obviously service very attractive dividend; and then third, we selectively pursue all attractive and financially attractive M&A and/or return excess capital to our shareholders through share repurchase. Specific to M&A priorities. As we discussed at our Investor Day, you can think about our M&A priorities, largely focused on our Accelerate business and within the Accelerate businesses, a bit more pinpointed within Evernorth Care in our U.S. government business. We may do tuck-ins in other aspects of our portfolio that are highly financially attractive, but the strategic accelerants would be more in the Accelerate business.  To your question relative to earlier this calendar year, we deem 2022 to be a bit unique for ourselves in that as we step into fiscal year 2022, we had the strong operating cash flow that Brian articulated earlier as well as the anticipated inflow from the divestiture of a portion of our international business at Chubb. So those two numbers create well in excess of $10 billion that we had to steward forward. That, coupled with our view of the price of our equity at that point in time led us to create as much clarity as possible for our shareholders in '22 relative to our commitment to share repurchase that we're on track for.  Looking forward, we'll maintain the capital discipline. We will be open to strategic M&A that advances us in the Accelerate businesses.  And then the final note you asked relative to '23, as you have in the past, you just think about we will deploy capital in the way I talked about before, either in a shareholder accretive way to achieve through the shareholder share repurchase and/or through accretive M&A and our contribution to our EPS growth rate in the 3% to 5% range year in, year out from the successful capital deployment that remains intact. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : Just a couple of numbers questions. First, the accelerated growth in your stop loss revenue has been impressive this year. Just wanted to get some color on what's driving that? And do you think it continues at, we'll call it, a solid double-digit pace in 2023. And then quickly, your medical cost reserves were down about 5% in the quarter. Just curious if there was anything driving that? Brian Evanko : Good morning, Justin, it's Brian. On the stop loss, we're really pleased with the strong growth that we've shown this year as you can see, both in terms of the quarter-over-quarter and the year-over-year premium growth with 13% and 12% growth, respectively, on that. Important to keep in mind, there's a few components that drive that. One is we've shown a very strong growth in our fee-based Cigna Healthcare customers this year, and many of those bring with them a stop-loss contracts. So there's some additional units, if you will, of stop-loss that are embedded in the year-over-year growth rate. On top of that, we have had strong firm price increases on our existing client base. And as you noted, now in the double-digit level with the 13% quarter-over-quarter, representing some of the later 2022 renewal dates, seeing strong price increases. And then finally, we have seen a bit of increased penetration on our existing ASO clients as well of the stop-loss products. So a few different factors that drove that strong growth. As we talked about in prior calls, we still have some margin expansion opportunity in our stop-loss book of business as we head into '23. So we would expect another year of strong growth in premiums for the stop-loss product in the 2023 calendar year. On the reserve side, there's really nothing in particular I'd call to your attention there. We continue to employ a consistent methodology to establishing our reserves. There will be some natural variability just between product mix shift and inventory levels changing from quarter-to-quarter. And overall, we feel good about the appropriateness of our reserves, and if you look year-over-year at the reserve levels, they -- all the key metrics that we evaluate screen appropriate and prudent. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Maybe just a quick fact question and then jump into the other question. But can you help us size the revenue that gets a little bit of difference on how Centene talks about the revenue contribution versus what it looks like CVS was booking from a revenue perspective. So can you help us size from a revenue perspective with the Centene contract and whether you get all of that in '24, whether that ramps up? And then I guess like my main question is just going to be about maybe going back to the M&A point, I just find it very interesting that you've got some competitors who are just out there constantly buying things and adding capabilities and other companies focusing more on share repurchase and selective smaller acquisitions. I guess, -- do you not see this as an arms race. It almost feels to me like a lot of companies are out there building capabilities. Do you feel when you think about M&A that potentially not pursuing M&A will be a disadvantage over the next three to five years if you're not doing deals today? David Cordani : Kevin, it's David. On your first piece, again, we'll look forward to providing you a lot more detail as we get into 2023 relative to 2024. At a macro level, I think the two data points to think about relative to the size of the relationship. And at today's state, there's about $40 billion relative to spend capacity. And as I noted in the prepared remarks, approximately 20 million customer relationships that will evolve and change over time. And as we provide more detailed guidance going forward, we'll try to separate that versus the revenue contribution. To your strategic question relative to M&A, first and foremost, I think you're framing is quite important. I wouldn't call it an arms race, I would call it stepping back. The marketplace demand for further value creation is and will remain consistently aggressive from that standpoint. Hence, innovation, additional value creation, strong operating execution and then selectively expanding your addressable market demand the strategy we deem to be mission-critical. Two, now stepping back to ourselves, as we discussed in our Investor Day, we're positioned with strong performing foundational businesses and well positioned to accelerate business. Those accelerated businesses are in sectors that have secular tailwinds. And then to the core of your point, how do we fuel additional capability growth. I'd ask you to think about it in a multipronged approach as opposed to M&A yes or no. One is significant targeted ongoing organic investment back into ourselves with new innovations and some of which I talked about today, some of which we profiled at our Investor Day, our new Pathwell programs, our unique longitudinal programs that take into consideration data, navigation support best-in-class clinical engagement with physicians and will increase value by taking costs out of the system through improving clinical quality. So organic investments are number one; two, is smartly and successfully leveraging our ventures capabilities to partner up with organizations to accelerate innovation; and the third is M&A. We remain quite open to M&A. We do not deem it to be a silver bullet. It's a part of the growth support strategy. So organic execution, investments in organic innovation, smart leverage of our ventures capabilities as well as M&A over time. And I would just come back and anchor it. Hence, our track record of strong top line growth, and strong bottom line growth with tremendous cash flow generation over the last decade by playing that recipe through which we will on a go-forward basis. Operator : Our next question comes from Ms. Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : I just really wanted to better understand as we think about the comment on the tailwind for 2023 around biosimilars. As you think about the plan design for '23, are you seeing employers and health plans willing to put the biosimilars on the formulary? I mean how much color and visibility do you have to that tailwind for '23? And is that primarily HUMIRA? Or are we thinking about other biosimilars as well? David Cordani : Lisa, it's David. First, relative to the category, as you know from prior conversations, we deem the category to be a net positive from a client, patient and customer standpoint as we look forward, '23 and beyond. As it relates to further improvements in affordability. And given the positioning of our Accredo capabilities, a net positive for ourselves. So just grounding on that for starters in terms of the capabilities to bring this to bear Second, 2023 represents the start of another step function, but the start of another step function as it relates to the biosimilars. Third, we will communicate our national formulary conclusions later this quarter, as you very well know, that's one dimension. And then there's client-specific formularies, decisions that are made that are underway.  So to the core of your question, it will vary in 2023 between international formulary as well as client-specific formularies on a go-forward basis. We deem it to be a net positive for the franchise in 2023. As I noted, it will present a tailwind for us in 2023. And that is HUMIRA-specific or the category specific, but others will begin to ramp as we move through 2023 into 2024. So a transitional -- I view '23 as a transitional year for the space with acceleration. Our decisions are about to be communicated and finalized relative to formulary decisions, and they're varied at an employer or health plan level. Our national formulary decisions will be consistent across that subset of our portfolio. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Josh Raskin : So the $200 million you mentioned for Centene preparation costs, is that pretax or after-tax? And then my real question is the outlook for Medicare Advantage for 2023. I'm curious, I know you've made some investments through this year, and you've talked about opportunities for margin next year, but I'd be curious on the growth front. And if you could just give us some color on how some of the newer county expansions have gone in recent years, that would be helpful. Brian Evanko : Josh, it's Brian. I'll take the first part of your question, and I think David will comment on the Medicare Advantage component. The $200 million that we quoted is a pretax figure. And again, as we work through the detailed implementation plans in terms of rate and pace. We'll continue to refine that estimate. But you should think of that as a $200 million pretax number for 2023 specifically. David, do you want to talk about Medicare? David Cordani : Sure. Josh, good morning. So specific to Medicare Advantage, let me take it maybe a little bit in reverse order to your question. Because as you articulate, we've been systematically adding new geographies, net new geographies and adjacent counties over the last several years. and successfully opening those counties in those markets. Second, as you would expect, your early sales in a net new market would tend to have a lower contribution than your sales in mature existing markets. The sheer nature of the operating cost environment and getting those businesses up and running from that standpoint. . Having said that, while we are very early in the 2023 decision-making process cycle as everyday kicks on, early presence reporting are positive as it relates to our current net growth algorithm and both in mature counties and markets as well as some of our new market entries. Looking at 2023, given the continued geographic expansion we've made, network improvement we've made, investment in distribution and marketing support as well as more resources and capabilities to begin to harness some of the commercial agents to Medicare, we expect [2003] to be a year of growth for our Medicare Advantage portfolio, and we look forward to updating you on that as we get through the latter part of this year. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Lindsay Golub : This is Lindsay Golub on for Nate. Congratulations again on the Centene contract win. Could you talk through some of the opportunities for future Evernorth service expansion and just strategic collaboration with Centene? David Cordani : Lindsay, it's David. Thank you for the acknowledgment. And as Brian noted earlier, we're excited and we're proud to be given the opportunity, and we'll seek to earn that opportunity day in, day out. And as Brian noted, before going to the core of your question, the team is 110% focused on a successful implementation and initiation of the relationship on January 1, 2024, and is heads down relative to that. . As it relates to future opportunities, I want to get ahead of ourselves relative to that, but we've demonstrated over time when we successfully partner and successfully collaborate, we have an opportunity to broaden and deepen relationships. And we enter this relationship with Centene, First and foremost, needing to, wanting to and fully committed to performing on the existing commitment. And then availing Centene as a partner relative to our Evernorth capabilities and our broad service capabilities to co-collaborate and innovate. So we see opportunity over time, but we're not getting ahead of ourselves. We're focused on the present and the present is a significant win for us. I would wrap around it. Our track record demonstrates deepening of relationships and broadening relationships like co-collaboration and co-development, and that's what we will seek to do with Centene after we successfully deliver on this promise. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Scott Fidel with Stephens. Scott Fidel : Wanted to talk -- ask about the ACA exchange market and how you're thinking about the setup for 2023 there. Obviously, some moving pieces on the competitive chessboard that should be favorable for potential enrollment growth. So interested in how you're thinking about enrollment growth for 2023 and then confidence in your pricing set up for 2023, if you do end up adding more membership than expected given some of the competitor exits confidence in also achieving your target margins for that segment as well? David Cordani : Scott, it's David. So broadly speaking, we have viewed this space as a space where we have an opportunity to grow over time. And as you all know, there's been a little bit of volatility since its inception, and we were -- we entered at inception and remained in the marketplace and continue to systematically grow. We'll grow our geographies as we step into 2023. And -- as it relates to the volume, we would expect to have net customer growth. Our current outlook is to have net customer growth in 2023, and we would expect that there would be a positive margin contribution. As Brian and I both noted, we expect the Cigna Healthcare portfolio in aggregate to have some further margin expansion opportunity. We believe that this subset of our space will have net positive margin contribution going forward. I'm not going to comment in terms of the latter part of your question went back to target margins as we continue to invest in, we know what the underlying book is performing at and what we expected to perform at. We'll make investment decisions in 2023 for 2024. That may dampen a little bit of the margins. Those are discretionary decisions for ongoing growth. But headline is well positioned for '23, expect to have net growth and expect to have good margin performance for the portfolio. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Gary Taylor with Cowen. Gary Taylor : One quick one for Brian and one for David. Brian, just on investment income in the quarter, looked a little light, even accounting for divested assets, the return looked a little light. So just wondering if there was something there, perhaps a little nonrecurring in terms of potential run rate on investment income. And then for David, I had a couple of clients ask lately about the DOJ intervening in the AMA lawsuit as well as the AMA joining the class action on the multiplan lawsuit. I guess the question really is just the legal profile of the company changed in any material way. I just wanted to give you a chance to comment on those. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Gary, as it relates to our investment income, within the third quarter, in aggregate, the investment income did slightly trail our expectations, but that shortfall was more than offset by the favorable medical care ratio performance within Cigna Healthcare, which allowed us to outperform both our Cigna Healthcare and Enterprise income outlook. Two things that are important to keep in mind as you reflect on that, and you referenced this in your question. The first one is the Chubb divestiture that was completed on July 1, resulted in a step-down of our investment income, and you can think of that as in the range of $50 million to $60 million per quarter. That's essentially removed starting in the third quarter. So any comparisons to historical periods need to normalize for that factor. The second area is within our alternative asset portfolio, which consists of think of this is private market, non-coupon assets. And this represents a minority of our invested assets, but it's subject to mark-to-market accounting for U.S. GAAP requirements. And given some of the challenges in the public capital markets this year, we had expected some downward mark-to-market adjustments in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, and that did transpire. Some of the downward marks were a little bit larger than what we had been projecting. But as I said earlier, strong medical care ratio performance in the quarter allowed us to exceed our overall income and EPS outlook. And as you think about the future and trying to run rate this, if you were to remove the Chubb-related contributions from 2022, the all-in net investment income for '23, you can think of it as approximately similar to the all-in 2022 investment income. So either a tailwind or a headwind as we step into '23 and the investment income one. David, I'll let you comment on the Medicare Advantage. David Cordani : Thanks, Brian. Gary, your broader framework, Gary, I'd step back and say, we have -- we do and we continue to operate in an active regulated space. Two, I'd point to, as we look at today in the past, we have a strong track record as an organization of being well governed and strong, healthy compliance-related programs. To that point and to the core of your question, I do not deem that the legal exposure, I think, is where you're going after with the profile of the company has changed meaningfully. And in some ways, given the strategic positioning of our franchise being more services-based, I would make the argument that the legal exposure footprint on a relative basis to the space is lighter from that standpoint, given the services-based nature of our portfolio is more intense and heavy. But no doubt, it's an active space has been, is and will continue to be an active space, but we're proud of our governance and compliance functions and capabilities. . Operator : Our next question comes from Ms. Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes. So a couple of follow-up questions here. Just to clarify, for 2023, is the EPS starting point that we should use is the $23.10. And then as we think about the Centene headwind of $200 million around 2% of earnings growth, are you assuming that excluding Centene, sort of the core business would have grown at that long-term target of 10% to 13%? Brian Evanko : Good morning, Ricky, it's Brian. So let me try to clarify some of the comments I made earlier as it relates to our 2023 outlook. So prior to the Centene contract award, the current 2023 consensus EPS estimate we see is reasonable. And so the last I looked this was in the range of $25.30, give or take a few cents. With the recently announced Centene contract, this will create an incremental 2023 headwind that will essentially need to be deducted from that 2023 earnings per share figure that I just referenced. . And then as I mentioned, as is normal, we typically start with our initial guide having some level of prudence in it, particularly since we have an at least EPS convention with the way that we communicate our outlook. So those are the different moving pieces that I would point to as you think about 2023. And then as I said earlier, relative to the two-year 2022 to '24 growth rate, we would expect that to be within our 10% to 13% compounded annual EPS growth rate range. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And then just one quick follow-up question. As we think about the Centene contract, is there any leverage that you gain with the additional scale that you'll see across the rest of the Evernorth book of business. . David Cordani : It's David. Broadly speaking, a framework of growth always presents opportunity. So I think your basic tenant is positive here. Additionally, our opportunity to further enhance the value we're able to deliver to existing clients especially those with higher government portfolios of business and/or strengthen our value proposition even further relative to winning new clients on a go-forward basis. So I would give you a directional answer, not a yes, no answer, but a directional answer that growth is a net positive, whether it's the ongoing investment back in innovation, the capabilities in subsectors of the space in terms of being much more government intensive within this portfolio or otherwise, I would say, net directional positive. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : I guess with the increase in membership guidance for '22 and the Commercial risk membership growth year-over-year actually accelerating as the year progresses. Just curious to hear a little more color just on the positive tailwinds there, kind of what's driving the extra commercial risk membership success? David Cordani : Steven, it's David. Let me talk a little bit more about the selling season, the dynamic in the process. As I noted in my opening, 2022 results for commercial portfolio business. First and foremost, we're pleased with. We're pleased with the MLR performance. We're pleased with the retention. We're pleased with the net growth. Two, in '22, a primary driver of that growth is good performance in our middle market and sustained success in our Select segment. Within our Select segment, we regularly offer ASO or self-funded with stop-loss, shoulder-to-shoulder with derivatives of and specific risk alternatives. And we provide choice, we provide choice declines relative to funding. We've designed our sales process, our underwriting process. And our solutioning process, we're able to put that choice forward. And year in, year out, it ebbs and flows between a different mix between ASO and stop-loss and risk business. We're pleased with the net risk results that underline that. But I think the overall headline is to sustain strong success of the Select segment.  Now more broadly, as you look at the portfolio, our fee-based business continues to grow. -- prior point it back to the meaningful growth in stop-loss. And finally, in my comments pointing toward 2023, we will have a very good national account, January 1. That's largely fee-based business. That's retention, it's expansion and this new business has as well as addition of large, what we would call middle market fee-based relationships going forward. So the underlying net growth is consistent. The quality is there in the MLR and our risk business, you see is really fundamental strength within our Select segment. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Lance Wilkes : Yes. Congratulations on that Centene win, a great job. Two just cleanup questions. One is in Evernorth, just understanding the driver of fees in the Evernorth segment? And the other is just a comment on utilization. Obviously, MLR was really down this quarter. Just interested in getting any comments on relative to maybe a baseline or kind of pre-COVID levels for commercial, public exchange and Medicare Advantage contrasted with sort of the nonmedical products. Like what's kind of the environment you're operating in, they're seeing right now? Brian Evanko : It's Brian. So as it relates to the fees in Evernorth and you can see the strength in this line, if you look at the statistical supplement in terms of fees and other revenue with strong 16% quarter-over-quarter, 21% year-to-date growth. There's a few different components that contribute to this -- so one, this is where our MDLIVE business shows up, and we've continued to see strong growth throughout the year in utilization of our MDLIVE services. Secondly, we have a number of Express Scripts or pharmacy benefit services clients who choose a pure fee-based relationship with us. So we offer a choice relative to how they want to work with us as some of them might want a formulary or a network-only relationship. And so that shows up in this line item. And then also our Evercore business in terms of medical benefit management, some of the post-acute care solutions, et cetera, all roll up into this line item. So all these things in totality are showing nice growth for the Evernorth business. As it relates to your second question, I think that was pointed at Cigna Healthcare more specifically in terms of utilization environment. Third quarter did run favorable to our expectations. Most of that favorability was in the U.S. commercial book of business with our government lines essentially in line with expectations. And within the quarter, both COVID and non-COVID costs in the U.S. commercial book were favorable to our expectations. Non-COVID favorability was predominantly driven by inpatient and emergency room. And on the COVID side of the house, we saw third quarter COVID-related costs running at a very comparable level to what they were in the second quarter, whereas we had assumed a bit of an uptick. So broadly speaking, that's how I would summarize what we saw in the third quarter. All in, our commercial book of business is running just slightly above what a pre-pandemic baseline would have been trended forward to your question there with Medicare a touch below that. Operator : Our last question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. David Windley : I joined late, so I apologize if this has been asked. But as you think about 2023 and kind of Fed pushing to slow labor market and potential recession implications, will you be thinking about recession possibilities as you set your guidance for '23? And how do you think the business is positioned to be resilient against that? David Cordani : It's David. So I think a really important question and that we didn't spend time on that. So thanks for the opportunity. First, from our point of view, there's little doubt the economy has been confronting some challenges. So recession, non-recession, there's been some challenges. And to date, important grounding, we've seen little direct impact for the demand of our services or the underlying performance for our portfolio, right? Movement in costs here or there. But broadly speaking, we've seen a little direct impact. As we look forward, by and large, we still see an environment where net-net employers are more oriented in terms of maintaining and/or hiring employees seeking to get to full employment. We do see instances where that has slowed. We do see instances where employers are putting freezes. But when you balance the portfolio as a whole right now, there's still a net hiring environment that sits in front of us, not to today. As we look forward, we absolutely play through scenarios that could have further softening of the economy or recessionary impact. At this point, we believe, given the visibility we have into the starting point of 2023 with the net growth we expect to step in the year with, coupled with the strength that we expect in 2022 with, those two points and the various levers we have within our diverse services portfolio and benefits portfolio, we believe we'll be in a position to deliver another strong 2023. Ending with, we acknowledge the fact that the economy is in a bit of a challenged environment in the current state. But all in, we believe our portfolio will be durable and is in a position to perform next year because of the strong start we'll have to the year and the various levers we have to manage in our portfolio. End of Q&A: Operator : I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : First, let me thank everybody for joining our call today, and I'll just wrap up with a few thoughts. First, our business is performing well. Our new collaboration with Centene is great evidence of the strength of our value proposition and how it continues to resonate in the market. We're growing with high levels of retention and winning new clients. We're performing well in this dynamic environment and our sustained disciplined execution is benefiting those we serve as well as our shareholders. . We are delivering for our shareholders and remain on track for our full year adjusted EPS outlook of at least $23.10, which is elevated from our prior outlook, and we are confident we are well positioned over the long term to continue to deliver on our annual adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 13% plus our meaningful dividend. This is all possible because of the breadth of capabilities we have across our organization, our proven commitment to innovation, but most importantly, the dedication of our more than 70,000 coworkers across the globe. I personally appreciate our team and what they do every day for our clients, our partners, our customers and patients and I thank them for the commitment to making a positive impact on people's lives each and every day. We thank you again for your interest in Cigna, and we look forward to continuing our conversation as we go into the latter part of this year. Have a good day.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded.  We'll begin by turning the call over to Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, Cigna's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results as well as our financial outlook for 2023. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2023 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in our cautionary note in today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the fourth quarter, we recorded after-tax special item charges of $17 million or $0.06 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. We also recorded an after-tax special item charge of $56 million or $0.18 per share for costs associated with the sale of businesses. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2023 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2023 dividends. With that, I'll turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thank you, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining today's call. 2022 was a pivotal year of performance and growth for our company. Evernorth further expanded its health service reach and impact, and Cigna Healthcare demonstrated tremendous resilience in the dynamic market. Together, the breadth and complementary nature of our portfolio enabled us to exceed our revenue and earnings outlook and return meaningful capital to our shareholders. This provides us with momentum as we begin 2023 and we expect another year of customer and earnings growth as we innovate and expand our broad portfolio of services and capabilities. Today, I'll provide perspective about our key drivers for our 2022 performance and how we're positioned for sustained growth going forward. Then Brian will walk through additional details about our 2022 financial results and discuss our '23 outlook. Then we'll take your questions. So let's jump in. As we reflect on our performance for 2022, I'm proud of what the company and Cigna team delivered overall. We grew full year revenues to approximately $181 billion. We delivered full year adjusted earnings per share of $23.27 reflecting a 14% rate of growth. We returned $9 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchase and dividends, and we sharpened the health service focus of our international business through the divestiture of our life accident and supplemental benefits businesses across seven markets. This performance demonstrates how well our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms are strategically positioned for sustained attractive growth.  In 2022, Evernorth delivered strong top and bottom line growth and also won, renewed and expanded several large multiyear client relationships for 2023 and beyond. The depth of Evernorth's capabilities and expertise is highly valued by our clients and partners and enables us to deepen existing relationships across our entire portfolio of businesses. Cigna Healthcare, our health benefits platform also had a strong year, delivering customer growth along with differentiated medical cost performance for the benefit of our customers and clients. Our U.S. Commercial business had a standout performance achieving outsized customer growth while maintaining pricing discipline and driving margin improvement. This reflects our ability of our Commercial team to work consultatively to help employers of all sizes manage affordability, all while we support healthy, highly engaged employees for the benefit of their businesses. Overall, we're pleased with the strength of our 2022 performance across our enterprise. As we look to 2023, we continue to deliver and capture meaningful value in multiple ways. First, we expect sustained growth through our foundational businesses, Pharmacy Benefit Services, U.S. Commercial and International Health. These are mature scaled businesses that have established core relationships with corporate clients, health plans and governmental agencies. The value proposition for these businesses continues to resonate very well in the marketplace.  In Pharmacy Benefit Services, we expect continued contributions in 2023 through the strength of our unique solutions and partnership orientation. With the strong selling season across our employer, health plan and governmental agency portfolio, we will continue delivering greater affordability to more customers and patients. Additionally, we are investing meaningfully to put in place the teams and resources to make prescriptions more accessible and affordable for approximately 20 million Centene customers starting in 2024. In the U.S. Commercial business, we also had a strong 2023 selling season across all our market segments and across all funding types, self-funded risk and shared return arrangements. As a result, we anticipate driving another year of earnings, customer and revenue growth. And in International Health, we expect continued revenue and earnings contributions through our leadership in meeting the health and wellbeing needs in attractive growth markets and for the globally mobile. Second, we expect outsized growth from our accelerated businesses, Accredo Specialty Pharmacy, Evernorth Care Services and U.S. government. These businesses have differentiated capabilities and platforms addressing accelerated secular growth trends. With Accredo, we were able to lower cost for patients and plans while preserving choice and flexibility for those who could benefit from new drugs. This includes our work to increase the availability of biosimilars. We've seen a handful of these lower-cost alternatives for biologic drugs launched in the past few years and understand the exceptional value they deliver for the benefit of clients and customers. 2023 will mark the start of a growing market opportunity for biosimilars, a trend that we expect to continue ramping up in 2024 and beyond. This includes HUMIRA, a treatment for a range of inflammatory conditions and one of the top-selling drugs globally over the past decade. Now there's a biosimilar alternative that we've co-preferred on a national preferred formulary creating significant savings opportunities for clients and customers. We will continue our leadership in advocating for greater availability of biosimilars, which over time, we expect to drive even more savings and benefit for patients and clients. In Evernorth Care Services, we are continuing to enhance and expand our portfolio of capabilities in care management and care delivery. Last year, MDLIVE virtual patient visits grew meaningfully, including a substantial increase in primary care visits. Demand and satisfaction with virtual care is rising and we will continue expanding our MDLIVE platform to provide even more of these options for the benefit of our customers. Evernorth Care Services is also accelerating our value-based care capabilities through our recently announced partnership with VillageMD. Our wrapping Evernorth health service capabilities with VillageMD's network of physicians, we will help guide more patients to high-quality care experiences at lower overall total costs. We expect this partnership to begin rolling out over the course of this year. In the U.S. government, another accelerated business, we expect strong growth in 2023 as we expand services and our geographic presence across a large and growing addressable market. This includes Medicare Advantage, where we will introduce enhanced services and benefits, and we nearly doubled the size of our provider network over the last two years as we expand into new geographies. Additionally, as we have demonstrated continued consistent commitment to participating in the ACA exchange marketplace, in a dynamic environment, our Individual & Family Plan business, we will see outsized customer growth in 2023. The third growth driver for us in 2023 and beyond is enterprise leverage. This is where our businesses work together to create or capture more value than anyone could achieve on their own. Here, think about our ability to look across our enterprise and client relationships to broaden and deepen them by leveraging our entire suite of capabilities. A great example is a new large service-based relationship for Cigna Healthcare where we were able to expand our support for a long-served Evernorth client. Additionally, the depth of clinical expertise success in advancing innovation and breadth of solutions within Evernorth, all combined to help further improve Cigna Healthcare's value proposition. For example, in 2022, by harnessing Evernorth's capabilities and programs, Cigna Healthcare delivered exceptional affordability, a key reason it continues to be competitively attractive option for employers of all sizes. This ability to deliver meaningful value is what makes Evernorth a partner of choice to a wide range of health plans, large employers and other clients. Another way we generate enterprise leverage is with our longitudinal portfolio data, which enables us to accelerate innovation and create new solutions for our clients and customers. This is specifically how we developed our Pathwell programs where we're able to integrate Cigna Healthcare's high-performing provider networks and benefits management with Evernorth's analytical and clinical expertise as well as personalized digital support. This equips Pathwell to lower cost while connecting patients with the right care, anticipating their future needs and helping them recover more quickly. Pathwell\u2019s focus in 2023 includes musculoskeletal conditions and patients who take injectable or infusible biologic drugs. Early feedback here has been very positive, and we expect to support millions of patients throughout these programs with better experience, clinical quality, costs, resulting in improved overall value. These examples illustrate just some of the impact we've already achieved with our cross-enterprise leverage, and we'll continue acting on additional opportunities in the years ahead to expand relationships, accelerate innovation for the benefit of our customers, patients and clients. Now I'll briefly summarize. 2022 was a strong year of performance and growth for our company. With our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms, and our durable growth framework, we are well positioned to meet the needs of our customers, clients and partners as we look to the future. We are delivering on our commitments to our shareholders with our 2022 adjusted EPS of $23.27 and returning $9 billion in share repurchase and dividends. And we are also responding to evolving needs of those we serve in the coming years in the Healthcare environment of accelerated change. We have a differentiated innovation pipeline that will allow us to build on our momentum and create value, continue to advance our growth strategy. We are confident 2023 will be another year of strong performance for our company as we expect to deliver customer and earnings growth. Our EPS outlook of at least $24.60 and the 10% increase of our quarterly dividend reinforced our commitment to sustained impact and growth for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Evanko : Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, and I'll provide our outlook for 2023. We're very pleased with our strong performance in 2022, reflecting focused execution and growth across both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, with each segment achieving pre-tax adjusted earnings growth in line or above our long-term targets. This positions us well for continued growth in 2023.  Looking at full year 2022 specifically, key consolidated financial highlights include total revenues of approximately $181 billion, and adjusted earnings of $7.3 billion after tax or $23.27 per share, reflecting 14% growth from 2021. This is above the high end of our 10% to 13% long-term average adjusted EPS growth target. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. 2022 marked another year of sustained growth and profitability in Evernorth, as our innovation, market-leading clinical capabilities and proven track record of delivering for clients and customers continue to resonate in the market. Turning specifically to fourth quarter results for Evernorth, revenues grew to $36.2 billion, while pre-tax adjusted earnings grew 6% over fourth quarter 2021 to $1.7 billion. Similar to the first three quarters of 2022, Evernorth's strong results in the fourth quarter were driven by continued expansion of our accelerated growth businesses, led by our specialty pharmacy as well as our focus on affordability and delivering lowest net cost solutions for our clients and customers. We also continued to make meaningful strategic investments, which serve to strengthen our client relationships, expand our services portfolio and advance our digital capabilities. Overall, Evernorth delivered another strong year, focusing on driving value for clients and customers and expanding our partnerships and relationships, all while achieving strong revenue and pre-tax adjusted earnings growth in line with our long-term growth targets. Our recently announced collaboration with Centene that begins in 2024 as well as other large multiyear contracts we renewed for 2023 further demonstrate the strength of our value proposition and proven partnership orientation in the market, providing long-term opportunities to grow while driving lower costs for our clients. Turning to Cigna Healthcare. As we entered 2022, we shared with all of you our goals of both growing our customer base and expanding margins. I'm pleased to report we ended the year accomplishing both of these goals, as we grew our medical customer base by 5% or 923,000 lives to 18 million total customers, while improving full year pre-tax adjusted margins to 9%, a year-over-year improvement of 90 basis points. Fourth quarter 2022 performance contributed to full year results with adjusted revenues of $11.1 billion, pre-tax adjusted earnings of $500 million and a medical care ratio of 84%. Despite an elevated flu and RSV season, our medical care ratio was slightly better than our expectations, particularly within our stop-loss products. Our medical care ratio for full year 2022 of 81.7% improved 230 basis points compared to the prior year. Both full year and fourth quarter results benefited from pricing discipline and affordability initiatives, including our clinical programs. Overall, Cigna Healthcare delivered for our customers, clients and partners, all while driving a strong year of customer growth and margin expansion with full year pre-tax adjusted earnings growth of 13%, which is above the high end of our long-term target range of 8% to 10%. Turning to Corporate and Other Operations. The fourth quarter 2022 pre-tax adjusted loss was $382 million. As a reminder, this segment previously included earnings contributions from the international life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses that we divested to Chubb on July 1, 2022. Overall, Cigna's 2022 results were strong, reflecting focused execution for the benefit of our clients and customers. As we turn to 2023, we continue to expect underlying growth in both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, while continuing to make strategic investments to drive future growth. For the full year 2023 outlook, we expect consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $187 billion. We expect full year consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $7.33 billion or at least $24.60 per share, consistent with our prior EPS commentary on our third quarter earnings call. I'd like to remind you this outlook includes a headwind from costs we will incur in 2023 to prepare for serving Centene's customers. This contract starts on January 1, 2024, and we look forward to many years of partnership and collaboration as we drive affordability for their customers.  Additionally, with regards to earnings seasonality, we would expect a different cadence this year when compared to historical patterns, with earnings more back half weighted, in first quarter representing slightly above 20% of the full year EPS. For full year 2023, we project an adjusted SG&A expense ratio of approximately 7.3%. And we expect a consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 21% to 21.5%. I'll now discuss our 2023 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $6.4 billion. Tailwinds and headwinds are largely consistent with the points we highlighted on our third quarter earnings call. These include tailwinds from a strong selling season and value creation from the increased availability of biosimilars, building in the second half of 2023 and ramping in 2024 and beyond. These are partly offset by headwinds from additional costs to support future growth, including implementation costs associated with onboarding Centene prior to receiving revenue, strategic investments in our accelerated growth businesses and the expansion of our relationships with the Department of Defense and Prime Therapeutics. In consideration of these tailwinds and headwinds, we expect adjusted earnings within Evernorth to be weighted more towards the back half of the year, with low single-digit year-over-year earnings growth in the first half, followed by mid-to-high single-digit year-over-year earnings growth in the second half. For Cigna Healthcare, we expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $4.4 billion, representing growth of at least 8% year-over-year. We expect 2023 Cigna Healthcare earnings to be split closer to 50-50 between the first half and second half of the year. This outlook reflects the strength of our value proposition and focused execution in our business driven by organic customer growth and disciplined pricing.  Key assumptions reflected in our Cigna Healthcare earnings outlook for 2023 include the following : regarding total medical customers, we expect 2023 growth of at least 1.2 million customers, with growth across each of our U.S. Commercial, Medicare Advantage and individual businesses. Within U.S. Commercial, we expect organic customer growth across each of our national, middle market and select market segments. And similar to 2022, the growth will primarily reflect fee-based customers. We expect Medicare Advantage customer growth of at least high single digits, and we expect growth in our U.S. individual business of at least 300,000 customers, driven by geographic expansion, strong industry growth and the exit of competitors from certain geographies. We expect the 2023 medical care ratio to be in the range of 81.5% to 82.5% in part reflecting an increased mix of government business, which tends to have a higher medical care ratio compared to U.S. Commercial and International Health. Additionally, we would expect the first quarter 2023 medical care ratio to be within the full year guidance range.  As it relates to Corporate and Other Operations, this segment has evolved given the divestiture of a portion of our international business last year that had been a positive earnings contributor in the first half of 2022. As a result, we expect the full year 2023 pre-tax adjusted loss to more closely reflect annualized fourth quarter 2022 results. Now moving to our capital management position and outlook. In 2022, we finished the year strong and delivered $8.7 billion of cash flow from operations. We returned $9 billion to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends in 2022. Specific to share buyback, we repurchased 27.4 million shares for $7.6 billion. Additionally, our debt-to-cap ratio finished the year at 40.9%, an improvement of 80 basis points from year-end 2021.  Now, framing our capital outlook for 2023. We expect at least $9 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our enterprise. This positions us well to continue creating value through accretive capital deployment in line with our strategy and priorities. We expect to deploy approximately $1.4 billion to capital expenditures. These investments will include substantial commitments to our accelerated growth platforms of specialty pharmacy, Evernorth Care, and U.S. government. We expect to deploy approximately $1.45 billion to shareholder dividends, reflecting our increased quarterly dividend of $1.23 per share, up 10% from 2022 on a per share basis. Year-to-date, as of February 2, 2023, we have repurchased 1.6 million shares for $510 million. And our guidance assumes full year 2023 weighted average shares to be in the range of 296 million to 300 million shares. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our asset-light framework that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital.  And now to recap. Our full year 2022 consolidated results reflect strong contributions and execution from both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Our 2023 outlook reflects continued momentum across our segments as we invest to support long-term attractive growth. We are confident in our ability to deliver our 2023 full year adjusted earnings of at least $24.60 per share. And we continue to expect to deliver 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $28, consistent with our prior EPS commentary. With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. A.J. Rice : I might ask a little bit more about where you're at in the rollout of the VillageMD value-based contracting arrangements. I know when the deal was signed, contracts had to be signed in the various markets with the VillageMD folks. Have you largely been able to do that? Maybe give us anything you can about how you see that business ramping up in terms of contribution to Evernorth revenue and operating income over time. I assume it will be not particularly material this year, but as you look out over the next few years. David Cordani : Good morning, A.J., it's David. So first and foremost, stepping back, we're pleased with the relationship and the ability to partner with a proven organization that has a nice growth track record. Two, you think about the work taking place collaboratively in phases, with the first phase of well underway working through and successfully securing approvals and contracts with building momentum, whereby we will put in place with Village, capabilities such that we could enable more targeted access to preferred or higher-performing specialists within the Cigna Healthcare Life portfolio and the direct serve portfolio of our relationships as Phase 1 and expand some of the capabilities to coordinate care, whether it's expansion of virtual capabilities, expansion of behavioral capabilities or otherwise. There's a second phase of work, so the innovation will continue, whereby we work with Village to codify and build some new products that have exclusivity relative to their proven physician leadership and physician-directed programs that have even a more targeted value proposition not just for the benefit of Cigna Healthcare on the benefit side, but offered for the benefit of health plans we serve in a broader sense and for Village. One of the wonderful parts of the way the relationship is built through leveraging the Evernorth capabilities, we'll be building a lot of the shared savings together with Village. And as such, be able to benefit from those shared savings through our Evernorth program.  So to recap, good momentum already, good collaboration already, good progress already. You're right, we don't market as a significant revenue or earnings driver in 2023 for us, but we will see progress in 2023, especially through the second half of the year and a building contributor in 2024, and we look forward to providing you more of an update as we look to 2024. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Gary Taylor with Cowen. Gary Taylor : I also wanted to ask about VillageMD. So David, we'll keep you on that track just a little bit longer. My question -- I guess I have a couple of questions about it. One is, I know historically, your inclination was Cigna didn't need to own delivery assets even though your peers are increasingly moving in that direction, and this investment does obviously give you some ownership of a delivery asset. So just wanting to understand how much your thinking has evolved along those lines? And then secondly, I just kind of want to understand a little better long term. Village obviously has this large growth national expansion plan, how do you -- but payer agnostic. So does it really just become a important partner and a part of a preferred primary care network? Or how do we think about the next several years, like what that relationship means to the Cigna Healthcare and to Evernorth? David Cordani : Sure, Gary. A lot in there. Let me try to address the points, all important points, and I appreciate your question. First and foremost, to be clear, our strategy remains consistent. Our preferred approach on the core medical fulfillment of care is to partner and enable. I'll come back to that. As we've discussed before, there are parts of the healthcare delivery or service fulfillment equation that we seek to own, and we're very clear relative to that. Examples include virtual, behavioral, specialty pharmaceutical fulfillment and select aspects of home care, we deem them to be unique, highly differentiated and an ability to leverage over multiple geographies in an efficient way. Our notion of partnering continues through, we'll call it, core value-based care, where today, about 75% of our MA customers have a value-based care relationship. About 50% of our exchange customers have a value-based care relationship. And about 40% of our commercial employer business has a value-based care relationship. Now to the Village relationship. First and foremost, it's also a clear depiction as we discussed at our Investor Day, that we see the healthcare delivery system community as an addressable market for us. We see it as an addressable market to bring additional services to help to extend their reach, their care coordination, curation of high-performing specialty networks and overall continuity of care, including digital aspects of the care equation. So the Village relationship, we see as an extension of partnering we see that payer agnostic orientation that you articulated as a positive because Evernorth serves a broad portfolio of clients including most of the large health plans in America today in some way, shape or form. And we see the ability to grow collectively and collaboratively with Village as a positive, but through partnering set of relationships. So to reiterate, there are aspects that we'll seek to own. We will continue to use our current process of incentive alignment and care coordination to extend our core value-based care offerings. And now with Evernorth, we will seek to deepen those services with select provider partners for the benefit of the totality of the panel, not just for the Cigna Healthcare lives that go through. However, there may be some unique programs that are designed from a Cigna Healthcare standpoint. So we see this as a great win-win and an additional growth opportunity for Evernorth. Gary, I hope that helps. Operator : Our next question comes from Ms. Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Erin Wright : You mentioned some of the headwinds and tailwinds for Evernorth into 2023. And obviously, there's the Centene implementation cost. But you also mentioned some other strategic investments. And can you quantify those? Or what is that exactly? And in the back-end weighting across the segment, is that largely attributable to those associated costs? Or is that a little bit of the HUMIRA benefit has been or changeable comes available midyear? Brian Evanko : Erin, it's Brian. So as it relates to the headwinds and tailwinds you're right to call out the strategic investments. So we continue to invest an outsized amount of money in areas such as our Evernorth Care services platform to enable things like VillageMD that David just discussed alongside our specialty pharmacy business, which continues to grow at very attractive rates. And so, that's all been factored in alongside the Centene related implementation costs. But importantly, we have tailwinds that allow us to introduce our guide today with at least 4.5% income growth for the Evernorth segment, inclusive of those pressure points on the spending side. As it relates to the cadence of Evernorth earnings, you should think of the back half weighting that I referenced is primarily driven by the biosimilar ramp effect that I described, but not entirely, there's also some effect of the cadence of operating expense spending over the course of the year that also impacts the timing. But the biosimilar contributions, we do expect to be more back half weighted, which is a key driver of the difference in the cadence. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin Fischbeck : I wanted to ask a little bit about the customer growth, that's a pretty strong number there. And so when you think about the enrollment growth, I guess, first on the ACA side, how comfortable are you about the risk profile and the pricing on that type of growth? And then as far as the commercial growth, is there -- I know it's ASOs so it's less risk -- worried about risk there, but just want to understand your thought process around how redeterminations impacted your growth expectations there? Maybe how much of that growth you expect there is in group versus kind of new customer wins? David Cordani : Good morning, Kevin, it's David. Let me start just frame it a bit more broadly and then ask Brian to peel back your question a little bit. First, we're pleased with the strong performance we delivered in 2022 and now being able to step into 2023 with a very attractive outlook. And it continues to reinforce that our Cigna Healthcare platform, including our Commercial employer portfolio continues to perform very well. I'd just highlight three areas quickly in terms of the underlying drivers or enablers of the continued growth for us. One, especially in the commercial employer portfolio is a consistent intense focus. We have, we are, we will continue to have a consistent intense focus on this segment as we see it as a growth segment. Hence, we focus and innovate for its benefit.  Second is a track record of excellent total cost or total medical costs. That is resulting from very good work from our network management team our clinical programs and the returns they deliver and our growing suite of site of care optimization programs that all contribute to good clinical quality service and overall affordability. And then finally, what we've talked about before, but maybe it's sometimes forgotten, our orientation around consultation and putting solutions in place. So whether it's an employer of 100 or an employer of 10,000, we take an orientation of consultatively working to put the right solution suite in place for them. I'm going to have Brian peel back the drivers of our outlook, I will put one asterisk on it. We have not factored in an uptake relative to redeterminations as a contributor in our outlook for the year. We recognize that redeterminations present an opportunity for us, not a risk for us because we don't have that business to protect currently. But given it's still uncertain in terms of the rate and pace of state activity to adjudicate their redeterminations, we don't have that factored into this very attractive outlook. Of course, we'll present updates to you as the year unfolds as states go through the redetermination process. I'll ask Brian to unpack the drivers of our membership growth a little further. Brian Evanko : Sure, David. Good morning, Kevin. So maybe just a little bit more detail here in terms of how to think about the 1.2 million plus net customer growth. And then I'll hit your question on the ACA exchange profitability as well. So first off, I'd be remiss if I didn't say we're really pleased with another year of strong growth that we expect here in 2023 and following growing almost 1 million net customers or 5% in 2022. And as we mentioned earlier, we expect net growth in 2023 across all of our major U.S. business segments with the individual exchange business expecting at least 300,000 net customer growth. Our MA net growth has started strong. We expect at least a high single-digit percentage growth rate for 2023, in line or better than industry growth rates. And we expect at least 250,000 net new customers generated by core growth across our U.S. Commercial portfolio. So if you take those three components together, they represent about half of our expected full year net growth of 1.2 million plus customers. And then the balance of the 2023 customer growth, you can think of as the net effect of some moving pieces, including the larger client relationship expansion that David mentioned in his prepared remarks. I mean we have good line of sight into this 1.2 million plus to David's point, we are not banking on any meaningful amount of volume for Medicaid redeterminations. As it relates to the morbidity and/or risk pool of the IFP business or individual business that we're adding, our 2023 customer growth outlook reflects a combination of a few things being industry growth our own new market entry as well as competitors exiting certain geographies that we participate in. As you think about where our margin profile stands, in 2022, the margins on this book are below our long-term goal. Our long-term goal is to remind you is 4% to 6%. We took a step forward in '22 from where we were in '21, given that '21 was a depressed margin year. But we're still below our long-term goal. And for purposes of '23, we continue to expect the margins on this book will run below our 4% to 6% long-term goal in our Cigna Healthcare income and MCR guidance reflects this. Just given the substantial amount of new customers we've added, we thought it was prudent to assume margins will be below our long-term target for this calendar year. But this is a book of business that does represent a source of future embedded earnings power that will help to contribute toward the long-term growth in the Cigna Healthcare segment income Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Scott Fidel with Stephens. Scott Fidel : I guess you guys get the first crack to comment on the preliminary 2024 MA rates and just interested in your initial observations on those. Obviously, we sell the final rates ahead and whether that influences your thoughts on your 10% to 15% long-term Medicare Advantage enrollment growth target at all, max? David Cordani : Good morning, Scott. Clearly, the initial or preliminary rate letter came out. But before I comment on that, just stepping back for a moment, it's clear that Medicare Advantage has represented and continues to represent a significant both market opportunity as well as a growth opportunity for the U.S. today serving about 30 million seniors continued growth and seniors reinforce the value, the clinical quality and the service quality they receive by continuing to renew and/or expand relationships in MA. The initial rate letter that came out does have lower or somewhat anemic revenue, we'll await the final rate letter that comes forward relative to that. Having said that, I think it's a little bit early to presuppose what 2024 growth outlook may look like because you compete on a relative basis. Having said that, this will create, if it stays in the range of what the rate letter looks like. It will create some revenue dislocation. So the sophistication of benefit management that's going to be necessary market by market. The leverage of value-based care relationships, which, as I noted earlier, about 75% of our MA lives are in a value-based care relationship will all come into play.  I reinforce the fact that the 10% to 15% is our objective to have 10% to 15% customer growth over time on average. We're stepping into this year with a very good customer growth outlook already that we feel good about. And as a final note, I would remind you that while an attractive long-term growth opportunity for us, today, this represents or MA represents less than 5% of the enterprise portfolio. So any dislocation in 2024, we deem to be manageable with the strong performing portfolio that we have in front of us. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : Just want to follow up first on the membership guide. Just any color on the pricing of that membership, how much comes in Q1 versus the rest of the year? And then healthcare margins certainly been a lot better there in 2022. Just wondering what ballpark you're expecting to be in 2023 there relative to your long-term guidance? David Cordani : Justin, a little color relative to pacing and then I'll ask Brian to talk about more to your second question. As Brian noted, we have good visibility into the membership volume. And when you think about the -- outside of the individual exchange business, what we've seen growth across all of our funding types. Still the lion's share of it is ASO including the service-based relationship with a large customer. So in essence, a meaningful portion of that volume will be realized in the first quarter of 2023, and then they'll be puts and takes throughout the course of the year. We'll look forward to providing you updates on. Now individual lines of business will move throughout the course of the year. But by and large, if you think about -- our expectation is that we'll have good performance relative to that on the first quarter of the year and then some puts and takes throughout the course of the year with some additional growth and maybe some additional disenrollment as we factored in some impact in our outlook for a bit of an uptick in disenrollment as we look at the current fragility of the U.S. economy. So good visibility for Q1. I'll ask Brian to talk a bit more around the margin. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Justin. So as it relates to the Cigna Healthcare margin profile, we're first off, really pleased to have finished 2022 with the 9% Cigna Healthcare margin, which is 90 basis points of year-over-year expansion which allowed us to return to the low end of our target margin range of 9% to 10%. So this stronger-than-expected 2022 performance certainly increases our confidence in executing against our '23 margin goals. As I noted in my prepared comments earlier, we will see some product mix shift in 2023, specifically with the government lines becoming a slightly larger percent of premium within Cigna Healthcare, and these products tend to carry a lower profit margin profile than the U.S. Commercial and International Health products. So when you consider all of this and our continued investments in our accelerated growth platforms such as MA, we'd expect our 2023 Cigna Healthcare margins to land within our target 9% to 10% range, but at the low end. Operator : Our next question comes from Ms. Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : I just wanted to come back to the PBM. David, you made a comment that HUMIRA would be on the formulary and parity with the biosimilar. Just curious as we think about AbbVie potentially increasing the rebates around that product? Is it better for the PBM if it shifts to the biosimilar? Or are contracts now set up in a way that you're going to share in the overall cost savings where it doesn't really matter. And then secondly, when we think about plan design, anything of note when we think about pharmacy benefit for 2023? David Cordani : Lisa, good morning. So to your first question, the co-preferred position that we have taken on our national preferred formulary is a mechanism to aid the transition, preserve and expand choice with aligned economics back to our clients and for the benefit of our customers and patients. I'd also note that that's our National Preferred Formulary, which is our largest single formulary. We support and administer multiple formularies that are customized for individual clients from that standpoint and avail choice. I'd also suggest that this will be fluid. It will flex over time. Third, as we've demonstrated within our PBM and our broad pharmacy portfolio services, we have the tools to align the incentives whereby when we enable choice and create value. Meaningful portion of that value are passed back to clients, customers and patients and a sustainable portion of the value is retained by us and the current position that we have taken aligns in that way. So it's not -- we have to have a reason of our brand drug versus the biosimilar, we have the mechanisms to afford additional choice, additional flexibility and to align the incentives. As it relates to the second part of your question, I would just give you by way of trend as opposed to an individual benefit design configuration or change, buyers in the space, be they corporate buyers, health plan buyers, et cetera, are seeking to push for more what we talk about internally all the time, coordination of services and continue to challenge point solutions. That plays very well for us. So when you think about an illustration of that, the Pathwell program around biosimilars, the Pathwell programs around biologics, the Pathwell programs around injectables is a way to further coordinate services with precision or a subset of patients and deliver more value from that standpoint, you have to harness data, you have to harness clinical capabilities, you have to harness digital capabilities. You have to harness network and benefit management capabilities. And again, the combined organization is well positioned for that. So I would say more precision in benefit programs on a go-forward basis that bring more targeted coordination, harnessing data and harnessing specific sub-segments. And again, we are well positioned for that and Pathwell is an illustration of that direction. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Joshua Raskin : I want to go back to Village and the partnership there. And I'm just trying to think about how Village and Cigna Healthcare work together and sort of how you have impact on their strategy? And are there targeted growth strategies in markets that may be stronger than, say, your MA book? And then, Dave, I think you said 75% of the Medicare Advantage business is in some sort of value-based care. How much of that is actually full risk or full capitation relationships? David Cordani : Josh, good morning, good to chat with you this morning. So let me take your second question first. In aggregate, a small proportion is in full cap. As we've discussed before, our preferred approach typically has a shared risk relationship. Some of it is in global cap for sure, but a minority of it is in global cap, a majority of it is in a shared risk, longstanding shared risk program. And then another minority would be an upside only P4P in terms of new relationship pay-for-performance. So if you think about it in terms of a suite of capabilities, our sweet spot and our preferred approach is a shared alignment program, not a global cap program, but we have some global cap. To the first part of your question, you came back to the Village and CHE side of the equation. So I'd ask you to think about, first and foremost, the relationship with Village that was built out and expanded is an Evernorth relationship. That's not to take away from CHE, I'll come to the core of your question in a moment. And that relationship, as I discussed with a previous question, is around helping to broaden and target the reach, broaden the reach and then target with precision around subspecialty and then coordinate services in an even more precise way off of their already highly performing value proposition. Now that will be benefited to Cigna Healthcare, but also other health lands and broadly speaking, Village's patient panel over time.  Now specific to Cigna Healthcare, this relationship presents the opportunity to design certain benefit alternatives or unique product alternatives in collaboration with Village because of our closer relationship. That will evolve over time, and those conversations are manifesting themselves already. And the positive there is that that's building off of an already positive relationship. So back to the main course here is an Evernorth\u2019s relationship and further evolving their already strong performance in terms of reach, precision for the breadth of the panel. Cigna Healthcare will benefit from that. It presents the opportunity in targeted geographies and to bring specific benefit alternatives forward for the benefit of Cigna Healthcare and all that is on the docket relative to co-collaboration right now. That's why we're so excited about the partnership with Village. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Unidentified Analyst : This is Nick on for Steve. I wanted to ask about the in-group trends you're seeing in Commercial, given the number of different data points we're getting on the labor market. I know the last time you guys spoke about it, you said that while you were starting to feel some of the headlines manifest employers were generally still in net hiring mode. I wanted to see if that was still the case and if there was anything to call out between select, middle market and national? David Cordani : Good morning, Nick, it's David. I'll just give you a little directional indicator here. So throughout 2022, broadly speaking, we saw the kind of net effect of hiring still the lead dimension in terms of playing through. Although as we've talked quarter-to-quarter throughout the course of 2022, we recognized there was a softening in the economy. As we get through the latter part of the year and the end of the year, that pretty much muted down and approximates canceling itself off. So the net hiring versus the net disenrollment moved to a slight negative. As I mentioned in a prior comment, our projection for 2023 assumes a further uptick or a further softening of disenrollment as we look at the economy, we don't -- within our book as we go case by case and relationship by relationship, we don't see large dislocations, but we think it's prudent to plan for some further softening throughout the course of the year, and that's fully factored in to our projection. I wouldn't call out one individual sub-segment. The National Press would say that small employers are continuing to hire in terms of fight to get to full levels of employment. So we can see some indicators relative to that. But broadly speaking, I would suggest you to think about -- we believe we've taken a prudent outlook in our full year membership outlook by further dampening the additional enrollment throughout the course of the year, and we think that's an appropriate approach. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : So just back on Evernorth again, within that context of the earnings growth being more back half weighted and faster growth in the back half. Just if you can remind us again how you're thinking about the cadence of recognition of the Centene PBM onboarding costs between the first half versus the second half? I'm wondering if that's still kind of fluid for you guys is how that might flow during the year? Or is that kind of set in stone as far as the weighting of that expense in the first half versus the second half? Brian Evanko : Good morning, Steve, it's Brian. So as it relates to the Centene related implementation costs in 2023, we do expect there to be an uptick over the course of the year in that spending. So you can think of it as growing from the first quarter through the fourth quarter modestly. So as you think about the total spend. So we've incurred a small fraction of the total we expect to spend over the course of the full year. But importantly, which if you think about that mathematically, it goes against the concept of back half income weighting. The magnitude of that is far outweighed by the other factors that I referenced earlier in terms of the contribution from biosimilars ramping in the back half as well as the other SG&A patterns that will emerge over the course of the year. But you should think of the Centene related costs for the course of the year and a small fraction of that already spent. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich : I wanted to follow up on the biosimilar ramp and how you're approaching formulary changes this year and going forward. I guess specifically to the negotiations manufacturers. Is that something that we should think about happening once per year on an annual basis does the entry of additional biosimilars give you the opportunity to go back to all manufacturers and negotiate additional savings? And then could you also talk about how you and your clients are thinking about the extent you want to drive patients to the lowest-cost product versus kind of maintaining choice and kind of access to different therapies? David Cordani : Good morning, Nate, it's David. You should think about, broadly speaking, the formulated decisions are made in the latter part of the calendar year, so deep into Q4 of a given year for the next year with the best insights; two, there's always some fluidity relative to drug launches that manifest themselves throughout the course of the year. In the case of biosimilars, we know there are drug launches expected in the Q3 timeframe of this year, of 2023, that we've fully contemplated and factored in. And we have the ability to flex formularies in the course of the year with individual clients, individual health plans, et cetera, obviously, on a consultative fashion. So view the decisions are largely made in advance of the year. However, you have the flexibility to go back and make adjustments my comments are not specific to your specific question around manufacturer-specific contracts through that lens. To the latter part of your question, by and large, employers, health plans, et cetera, are focused on clinical efficacy and comparative effectiveness. So the fixation relative to first and foremost as it should be clinical efficacy, making sure when there's any alternative that's available in turning the best external validation of the clinical equivalent of the impact of a pharmaceutical is evaluated properly and then comparative effectiveness, looking at the economics and then getting to a total low cost of care or best value equation. And then the employer or health line may make some trade-offs in terms of which levers they want to use to achieve that, but ultimately, it comes down to the best total cost equation once the clinical efficacy hurdle is crossed. And as I mentioned in the prior question, we have the tools, we have the services, we have the flexibility to avail employer by employer, health plan by health plan to be able to get them to the right balance that they want. But ultimately, it's the low total cost equation with the clinical outcomes that are preferred from that standpoint that drive the net conversations and the net decisions by employers and by health plans. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Lance Wilkes : Just wanted to follow up, David, on the comments you made on the VillageMD relationship, which was really helpful to kind of frame that. And what I was trying to understand is from the Evernorth side, it would seem that Evernorth could be a distribution partner wherever Evernorth could be helping Village to enable itself to better manage costs, either through providing MD live or networks or Evernorth PBM services, et cetera. So maybe a little more color on sort of what is the primary role that Evernorth is playing there? And then just secondarily, for the MCO, how important and what is the opportunity for in addition to new product design for you to cross-sell in your ASO block, the VillageMD sort of value-based care source of services? David Cordani : Good morning, Lance. So I think your framework is quite helpful. If you think about the building blocks you articulated, you laid them out quite nicely. I just would play with the order a little bit. Job one for us with Village is to work in partnership, right? It's not to push a product. It's a work in partnership to avail additional capabilities off their already strong performing platforms to further improve affordability or clinical quality. So let's take an example. Take the opportunity to curate in an individual market or submarket for larger markets, the highest-performing oncology providers for certain tumor types or certain diagnoses. Our longitudinal datasets enable that in a very differentiated way, be able to bring a bit more precision. The net result of that is, therefore, for a Village patient, a higher probability of getting the best possible evidence-based care and coordinated care and therefore, best overall value. Of which then Village benefits from that. The patient obviously benefits from that. And what we've designed is the Evernorth enablement benefits from that. Point two is you want to distribution. We could bring more access in volume flow through the high-performing opportunities that exist here. There's no doubt around that, and we will seek to do so. And then third, where you came back to, we will absolutely help to enable these capabilities back, which is a subset of your distribution in a way back to our large well-performing portfolio of ASO clients by bringing yet even more precision of care coordination for their benefit. But in this case, we have through the Evernorth services and through the collaboration with Village, the ability to be rewarded in addition to the value we would be creating for their benefit. So there's multiple building blocks here, which is why we're quite excited. At the end of the day, if you put a big circle around it, Lance, it all comes down to how do we harness more data how do we harness more clinical coordination to bring even greater clinical quality and overall affordability, one patient at a time with a platform that is performing well, that is Village and then creating extenders and some care coordination that comes along with it. And through Evernorth, we have both the service mechanism and then the sharing mechanism built that will work in conjunction with Village for. Operator : Our last question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. David Windley : Scott asked the rates questions. It's been a couple of more days since the RADV rule. I thought I'd ask you, David, to provide your thoughts on RADV and navigating through that in addition to a tighter rate environment for next year? David Cordani : Sure. Good morning, Dave. So relative to RADV and the new information that came out, first and foremost, we deem that risk adjusters are and remain an important tool for the program. And as I noted before, a program that has worked obviously for quite some time for the benefit of seniors and delivering excellent clinical quality, value and service. Additionally, from a Cigna perspective, we remain committed to executing, obviously, this program in a highly compliant fashion.  Now specific to the RADV actions, we're pleased, the CMS concluded that they're not going to extrapolate their actions prior to 2018. We're concerned that we continue to question a couple of decisions. For example, the elimination of the fee-for-service adjuster that we deemed to be foundational to the program. And we await specifics relative to the methodology that is going to be used in some aspects of the extrapolation and work as we have in the past and as we always will, we will work closely with CMS to seek to get further clarity relative to the open items that are here. So a bit of a fluid environment but we see progress relative to the lack of extrapolation beyond 2018, and we see some open questions for the industry at large that still remain, and we will collaborate with CMS to get more visibility on that over the near term. Operator : I will now turn the call back to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : Thank you. Just to briefly recap, 2022 was a strong year of performance, growth and positive impact that our company brought forward. With Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, we demonstrated that we are serving the current needs of our customers, clients and partners, and we expect to deliver another year of customer and earnings growth in 2023. I want to recognize and more importantly, thank more than 70,000 co-workers around the world. It's ultimately their continued dedication and leadership that allows us to make a defining difference in healthcare and their demonstrated commitment to building on the momentum we've delivered to have a larger impact as we look to the future as we strive to improve the health and vitality that of those we're privileged to serve. With that, we thank you for joining our call today, and we look forward to our continued conversations as we go forward. Have a good day.

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter queue to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe : Great, good morning everyone, and thanks for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, The Cigna Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including our first quarter financial results and our updated financial outlook for 2023. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations, and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income, and total revenues respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of thecignagroup.com.  We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2023 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note in today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Regarding our results effective January 01, 2023 we adopted, amended accounting guidance for long duration insurance contracts, LDTI, and related amendments, our 2023 full year outlook included the impact of LDTI and prior results have been restated to reflect this change. There has been no material impact to prior results and this change will not materially impact our future operating results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance including our full year 2023 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2023 dividends. With that I will call -- turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks Ralph. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining today\u2019s call. We begin 2023 with momentum and in the first quarter we again delivered strong performance and continued our long track record of innovating for customers, clients, and partners. Today I will discuss some of the key drivers fueling our growth during the quarter and we also talk about how we are leading the way to address evolving state health care needs with a flexible financial model providing multiple avenues to deliver and capture revenue. Specifically, I will describe how the durable and flexible pharmacy benefit services we harbor continue to drive in the marketplace. Finally, we will provide additional details about our financial results and discuss our outlook for 2023 and then we will take your questions. With that let\u2019s get started.  In the first quarter we delivered $46.5 billion in total revenues, $5.41 in adjusted earnings per share, and we are ranging our full year 2023 guidance for adjusted EPS, revenue and customer growth. We are pleased with the strong start across Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare and we look forward -- as we look forward, we expect another very good year for the Cigna Group. Evernorth comprising pharmacy benefit services, specialty pharmacy, and Evernorth Care again contributed strong growth while retaining, expanding and winning new relationships for the employers, health plans, and governmental organizations we serve. Our foundational pharmacy benefit service business continued the strong performance demonstrating the value we provide to our clients and patients.  Specialty pharmacy which accounts for approximately 40% of Evernorth's total revenue drove outside its growth with a continued rise in new to market specialty drugs and increasing demand. Evernorth Care represents one of our most significant long-term growth opportunities given the growing needs a virtual care as well as for example behavioral health services. Insignia Healthcare, our health benefits platform, we achieved another quarter of revenue and customer growth with strong performance across our U.S. commercial, U.S. government, and international health businesses. With our focus on affordability and disciplined pricing, we are pleased with their medical cost performance and our medical care ratio which was 81.3%. Our U.S. commercial business is on pace for another good year. Our affordability initiatives continue to strengthen our overall competitive position and this has helped fuel our strong customer growth. Our momentum also is a reflection of how employers of all sizes rely upon our consultative approach and the breadth of our solutions to support the health, engagement, and productivity of their workforces. In U.S. government, our Medicare Advantage business is achieving above market growth in 2023 from a high quality and affordable plans, our geographic expansion, and the maturation of markets we previously expanded into. In a dynamic individual exchange market we also have substantial growth in our individual and family plan business, allowing us to bring Cigna Healthcare capabilities to a larger customer base. And in International Health, our earnings growth has been strong for the past few years and we expect positive top line and bottom line contributions again in 2023 given our high quality and localized health insurance solutions supported by our global provider network.  Overall, we're pleased with the quality, strength, and resilience demonstrated in our results and importantly, how they position us for another year of sustained growth and attractive value creation. Looking ahead, we are confident in our increased outlook for the year as well as our ability to sustainably deliver 10% to 13% compounded EPS growth over our strategic horizon along with providing an attractive dividend.  Today, I want to spend a few minutes on Express Risk, our pharmacy benefits business within Evernorth, including our recent announcements about how we are continuing to provide greater affordability, choice, and transparency for our clients and customers. Pharmacy services have an essential and impactful role in a time when in medical care, physical or behavioral are increasingly relying upon the use of pharmaceutical interventions. It's also important to recognize that successful care coordination programs for pharmacy services often create significant benefit and value for the medical services. We recognize the ongoing attention and legislative debate regarding the rising costs of prescription drugs. We are taking an active leadership role and I want to be clear about how we are using our differentiated capabilities to create and capture value out of the drug supply chain on behalf of our clients and customers.  First is the strength of our model, which is to deliver solutions and care coordination that address specific client needs and expand relationships with our full suite of services and capabilities, fueling our sustained attractive growth over time. Second, we are committed to enabling and prioritizing choice for our clients as we drive down costs. And third, we continue to build on our long track record of innovation to drive greater affordability, access, transparency and improved clinical outcomes. Stepping back, our Pharmacy Benefit Service business is achieving attractive growth because we're able to secure a diverse group of any growing client base, leading with the strength of our supply chain, clinical and care management programs. With our proven model Express Groups client retention rates are consistently in the mid-90s or higher and we've been able to continuously grow our pipeline and win new business, from medium size to the largest employers, from the local health plans to national players, and even the largest government sponsored programs.  We've expanded our efforts to advocate on behalf of our clients and customers particularly as it relates to financing models which are key areas of focus for some of the current legislative proposals. The Express Scripts business model starts with the commitment to enabling and prioritizing choice in benefit design and financing options for clients who are the primary financers of their employee benefit programs. This includes providing them the option to finance the cost of their programs by allowing us to share in the discounts we secure on their behalf, be it rebates or spread pricing. Our clients choose amongst these models based upon their needs for managing risk and greater predictability for the pharmacy costs as well as their cash flow.  For context, across the breadth of our Express Scripts Pharmacy Benefit Service portfolio today over 95% of rebate dollars are passed through to clients. The key point is that each client chooses the financing mechanism that works best for them. They have choices in how they pay for the value we deliver and many find that using rebate sharing or spread pricing generates a stronger level of alignment incentives in addition to being able to plan for predictable cash flow that it generates. Proposes to limit the availability and scope of these options will result in less choice for thousands of employers, health plans and government, the clients we serve and increase their costs over time. As it relates to Express Scripts, we are confident in our ability to earn sustainable and attractive margins for our services under a variety of legislative scenarios. We are able to create value through the breadth of our capabilities from supply chain to benefit design, driving competition amongst drug manufacturers to bring costs down, and deliver better health outcomes through our clinical programs. One area of focus for multiple stakeholders has been the amount of income we earn from rebate retention and retail spread. To put this in context, we expect about 20% of Evernorth's 2023 pretax adjusted earnings to come from Express Scripts retention of rebates and retail spread. This percentage has trended down over time and we expect it to continue trending downward. This is fueled by our ongoing innovation and greater diversification of our Evernorth businesses. I would also remind you that these financing options that we provide the clients are developed in exchange for lower service fees. So said otherwise if these programs decrease further overtime fee based income would increase. Therefore, we are confident that if some of these payment vehicles were reduced or removed by regulatory change or client preference, Express Scripts has a broad set of capabilities that create value and will continue to earn an attractive return. Let me provide some specific examples that reinforce our flexibility and durable model and how we tap into our long track record of innovation for better outcomes on behalf of our customers and clients who are seeking greater affordability and transparency for prescription drugs. First, we're taking several steps to expand transparency. Express Scripts new ClearCareRX fully demonstrates the flexibility we have for prescription drug benefits where clients pay exactly what Express Scripts pays pharmacies for prescriptions. They receive 100% of drug rebates that Express Scripts obtained by negotiating with pharmaceutical companies. They pay one service fee to cover the administration of pharmacy benefits, product services, reporting analytics and the program is supported by a fully audible mechanism. In addition, clients also benefit from guarantees to keep Express Scripts accountable for clinical and financial performance measures, including improvements in overall inheritance rates and patient outcomes. Additional steps to drive even greater transparency include providing clients with enhanced financial and feed disclosures regarding their spread pricing programs when they exist. Along with today's release about our first quarter financial results, you will also find additional disclosures we are providing about Express Scripts model in our quarterly regulatory filings and on our new microsite. We will also offer a new digital pharmacy benefits statement for customers starting in 2024. The statement will share drug pricing information, out of pocket costs and the net value delivered by Express Scripts on behalf of customers. With respect to the broader issue of drug pricing, to be clear, we were fully aligned with lowering costs of prescription drugs for customers. For example, Express Scripts Patient Assurance program launched in 2019 capped out of market costs for eligible members of select diabetes and cardiovascular medications. In 2022 alone, customers taking insulin saved more than $18 million because of this program. Now with the introduction of our new copay assurance plan, we are taking further action to cap out our pocket costs for customers in client prescription drug benefits at $5 for generic drugs, $25 for preferred brand medications, and $45 for preferred specialty medications. Finally, we also have a series of groundbreaking initiatives to further support pharmacists in rural communities across the United States. We are offering increased reimbursement to true independent pharmacists and partnering in opportunities to expand their clinical practices to further support care needs of the local communities. We are also convening an advisory committee of community pharmacists. These initiatives will encourage better care, expanded access to lower prices for rural Americans, as well as increasing a more sustainable revenue stream for independent pharmacists. We are encouraged by how our recent actions have been received by a wide range of stakeholders, including clients, our pharmacy network partners and policymakers. They recognize our commitment as a leader and trusted partner that could use to create value through our deep expertise in designing programs for specific client needs, driving innovation, and broadening our reach. In summary, we are demonstrating our leadership in the competitive pharmacy benefits market that is such a critical building block for the American healthcare system. We are serving specific client needs through the strength of our model and the effectiveness of our care coordination programs, allowing us to drive sustained attractive growth. We are continuing to advocate for clients and their ability to choose the appropriateness of programs that work best for the business as we help to lower costs. And we are continuing to innovate in driving greater affordability, transparency, and improved outcomes for those we serve.  Now let me briefly recap our performance for the quarter and our outlook. In the first quarter, we continue to execute and perform well. We delivered for our customers, clients and partners and our business kept our commitment to our shareholders. We delivered adjusted EPS of $5.41 per share and we're pleased to have increased our full year outlook or adjusted EPS, revenue and customer growth as well as an improved medical care ratio. We are confident in our ability to continue to deliver and capture value in the dynamic and changing environment. We've shaped our business model to navigate varying economic conditions and our differentiated capabilities within Evernorth to provide us with the flexibility to meet unique client needs and potential changes caused by regulatory requirements. Additionally, our business is driving growth that is generating strong cash flows and we are confident that we will further create value for successful and effective capital deployment. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Evanko : Thank you, David and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review Cigna's first quarter 2023 results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year. We're pleased with our strong start to the year. The first quarter adjusted earnings per share were above our expectations, demonstrating focused execution across our high performing Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare businesses. Looking at the quarter specifically, some key consolidated financial highlights include revenue growth of 6% to $46.5 billion, after tax adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $5.41, and cash flow from operations of $5 billion. This performance gives us the confidence to increase our full year adjusted earnings outlook to at least $24.70 per share.  Before I discuss our Evernorth results, I'll build on David's comments regarding our recent announcement to advance transparency around our PBM and I'll provide incremental details on our earnings drivers. I'd first start with a level setting that of our operating platforms ever takes up approximately 60% of earnings and Cigna Healthcare is about 40%. Within Evernorth, our Express Scripts PBM is a foundational asset with a diverse set of earnings sources including service and administrative fees, clinical programs, and value based care arrangements along with retained rebates and retail spread. These earnings sources are a function of the choices made by our clients. As David referenced, approximately 20% of Evernorth's adjusted pretax earnings are comprised of PBM retained rebates and retail spread. This percentage has decreased over time as we continue to expand fee based client relationships and as our Evernorth portfolio becomes more diverse and continues to grow. Importantly, as Evernorth's business mix has changed over the years, margins have remained stable. This speaks to our flexibility to adapt to an ever-changing market and gives us confidence in our ability to navigate disruption in the operating or regulatory environment. As David mentioned and I would underscore, our foundational PBM asset will continue to create and deliver significant value, which will allow us to sustain growth at attractive competitive returns.  Shifting to our current period Evernorth results, first quarter 2023 revenues grew 8% to $36.2 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion, in line with our expectations. Evernorth results in the quarter were driven by continued strong growth in our high-performing specialty pharmacy business and our focus on affordability and delivering lowest net cost solutions for our customers and clients. Additionally, we continue to build our cross-enterprise leverage capabilities, providing an additional avenue for growth as we further deepen our relationships across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. We also continue to make strategic investments, which serve to strengthen and grow our client relationships, expand our portfolio of products and services, and advance our digital capabilities. As it relates to our strategic partnerships, we remain on track in our implementation of the Centene contract that begins in 2024. And our collaboration with VillageMD is progressing and provides us an attractive opportunity to further accelerate our value-based care programs and capabilities. We will continue to expand these value-based solutions for the benefit of our Cigna Healthcare, U.S. commercial and U.S. government clients as well as other provider partners and Evernorth health plan clients.  Additionally, we remain confident around the multiyear accelerating biosimilar opportunity with high visibility into expected savings for customers and clients in the second half of this year, consistent with our prior expectations and regardless of utilization shifts for product approvals in the market. Overall, Evernorth continues to perform very well. Our diversified set of earnings streams, along with flexible financing models enable us to innovate and adapt through dynamic environments. Turning to Cigna Healthcare, first quarter 2023 adjusted revenues grew 12% to $12.7 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.1 billion, slightly above our expectations. The medical care ratio of 81.3% was better than expectations as overall utilization came in slightly favorable. This was reinforced by our clinical engagement models and related affordability initiatives as well as our continued pricing discipline. Turning to medical customers, we ended the quarter with 19.5 million total medical customers, growth of approximately 1.5 million customers since the end of 2022. This strong growth demonstrates the continued differentiation of our market-leading products and services. Our commercial customers increased 8% year-to-date aided by the addition of a large fee-based health plan client that expands upon an existing Evernorth relationship. And even excluding this client win, we drove organic customer growth across all of our U.S. commercial market segments. In our U.S. government business, we saw considerable growth in our U.S. Individual and Medicare Advantage customers, with MA growth of 10% on a year-to-date basis. Overall, Cigna Healthcare is off to a strong start in 2023 as we continue to deliver differentiated value and affordability to our customers and clients. Across our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms, we delivered strong first quarter financial results driven by our diversified portfolio of foundational and accelerated growth businesses, further bolstered by cross enterprise leverage. Now turning to our outlook for full year 2023. We have increased our expectations for full year 2023 consolidated adjusted revenues to at least $188 billion, enabled by continued growth and deepening customer relationships in Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth. We are also increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook to at least $24.70 per share. Consistent with our prior commentary, we expect earnings this year to be back half weighted in large part driven by Evernorth's earnings ramp over the course of the year with second half EPS contributing slightly below 55% of full year EPS. In Evernorth, we expect continued strong performance, all while investing in growth and innovation. We continue to expect Evernorth full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $6.4 billion. In Cigna Healthcare, we are raising our medical customer growth expectation to at least 1.3 million customers, an increase of 100,000 lives. We are improving our 2023 medical care ratio outlook to a range of 81.5% to 82.3% and we are raising our expected full year 2023 adjusted earnings to at least $4.425 billion. Despite the dynamic macroeconomic environment, we have yet to see material impact to Cigna Healthcare enrollment levels. We remain prudent with respect to our enrollment outlook for the rest of the year as evidenced by our full year guidance relative to the first quarter customer growth results. To be clear, we continue to expect underlying organic employer client growth as we move through the year. And our outlook continues to assume some elevated disenrollment in the second half of the year corresponding with some expected softening in the economy. Additionally, as a reminder, our outlook does not contemplate incremental customer growth from Medicaid redeterminations. Finally, when contemplating the Cigna Group's performance under various future economic scenarios, it's important to keep in mind that we have strategically positioned the company's portfolio of businesses to be more diversified than it was in prior economic downturns. This gives us confidence and resilience to weather dynamic macroeconomic environments.  Switching gears, let's move to our 2023 capital management position and outlook. Our debt to capitalization ratio was 42.2% as of March 31st. We expect to lower this ratio over the balance of the year, and we continue to target a long-term debt to capitalization ratio of approximately 40%. Year-to-date through May 4, 2023 we have repurchased approximately 3.7 million shares of common stock for approximately $1.1 billion. And for full year 2023, we continue to expect at least $9 billion of cash flow from operations. Our balance sheet and our cash flow outlook remains strong benefiting from our highly efficient service-based model that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins, and attractive returns on capital. So now to recap. First quarter results were above our expectations, reflecting strong contributions across our diversified portfolio of complementary businesses. Evernorth continued to deliver strong results with the first quarter in line with our expectations. While Cigna Healthcare had a strong start to the year, giving us confidence to deliver on our increased 2023 EPS guidance of at least $24.70. We continue to expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $28 consistent with our prior commentary. And over the long run, we continue to expect average annual EPS growth of 10% to 13% and are confident in our ability to adapt and navigate the operating and regulatory backdrop with our diversified business mix, and complementary capabilities across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ms. Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan. You may ask your question. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much, good morning. David, thank you for all the comments around the PBM and profitability, etcetera. I guess my first question is really to understand where do you think the disconnect is from a legislative standpoint versus how the PBMs actually operate? And then secondly, when we think about an employer, it feels to me that a lot of this legislation is going to take away that decision-making by the employer, what are employers saying to you around legislation, what are they saying to you around the selling season, and then also if you can just give us an update as to how you're thinking about the 2024 selling season? David Cordani : Lisa, you put a lot in there. Good morning and thanks for the questions. Let me try to touch on each. First, as we step back, as I noted, we're quite proud of the results that we have delivered and continue to deliver in view of the PBMs using that acronym, but the pharmacy service organizations are the organizations that relentlessly work to improve affordability for the benefit of a broad constituency group. I think to your first question, if we step back, well, we could point to tremendous results in terms of clinical trends, outcome, affordability on average, less than $1 increase in out-of-pocket costs for individuals. We do recognize, and I think this is part of the legislation or the legislative energy, the program still don't work for everyone.  So for example, while the programs are designed to generate overall affordability, if there's a high deductible plan is an illustration and in the month of January, someone has -- it is a deductible and has a significant out-of-pocket for our pharmaceutical experience that creates a financial dislocation for an individual, that's a failure of the system, right. We need to step up to that. We need to innovate because that's an unintended consequence of the failure of a system. So we could talk about the averages that we're proud of from an affordability, but we need to make sure we continue to innovate till it works for everyone or we could talk about the fact that we have leading breadth of network access through our pharmacy networks, coupled with our home delivery, yet when you look at the uniqueness of America in some rural locations may not have the access or accessibility in a specific case. And therefore, the market is not working for those individuals. Hence, you see some of the innovations we step forward on.  Our copay assurance program directly goes at the out-of-pocket predictability for individuals under a variety of circumstances. Our rural pharmacy and independent pharmacy initiatives go directly at specific actions to support individuals. So the averages when we sit and look at the data is accepted, we need to do better, and we're stepping forward as a leader to do better from that standpoint. As it relates to employers, our retention rates and our new business growth rates reinforce the fact that by and large, employers see us as being successful. I would note that our ClearCareRx program that we just rolled out, that was two years in design and we worked with about a dozen sophisticated large employers to design those programs to work for them and work for us and how we can roll those out and scale. And as we sit here today, we have hundreds of clients together with our Evernorth team and our Express Scripts team talking about future innovation. So there remains high receptivity and high receptivity to the advancements we're making in terms of further transparency in clinical programs, but they like their choice. They like having the choice of financing mechanisms, which we are aligned with. And then finally, maybe just to manage time, on the 2024 selling season, 2024 will be another year of growth for us in the Evernorth service portfolio. We will see strong retention. As I noted, our retention has historically been in the mid-90s or better. We will see strong retention and we will see good growth as our products and programs resonate in the marketplace. Lisa, thanks for the questions. Operator : Thank you Ms. Gill. Our next question comes from Mr. Steven Valiquette with Barclays. You may ask your question. Steven Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good morning. So regarding the Evernorth results in the first quarter, you mentioned they were in line with the expectations. Just with the script volume though being down, just curious to get more color on that? And also, I know you're not giving script volume guidance for the full year, but just curious if the trends in the first quarter are good run rates for the full year? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning Steve, it's Brian. Yes, as I mentioned earlier, our Evernorth results are very much in line with expectations for the quarter. One thing that's important to keep in mind, David mentioned 40% of the revenue in Evernorth now is derived from our specialty pharmacy business. And as you can appreciate, the Specialty Pharmacy script counts end up being dwarfed by the generics and the higher-volume script counts that come through the PBM. So it's a little bit misleading to look at the aggregate script counts for those reasons. And I'd note our -- the revenue in the Specialty Pharmacy grew mid-teens year-over-year. So it was a very strong grower. You saw strong script growth in specialty, but again, it was dwarfed by the big picture of the PBM generic volumes moving around a bit. And as you think about the overall script counts year-on-year, I think of the client mix changes that occurred from 2022 to 2023 is driving a good bit of that and that really drove the kind of flattish all-in script counts. Now as we look forward to 2024, obviously, we prepare to onboard Centene, you'll see a meaningful step-up in that metric. But as I mentioned earlier, with the specialty pharmacy growing at such an attractive rate, it's a bit masked when you look purely the script count metrics. So hopefully, that helps a bit. And when you put all those pieces together, we're getting confident and comfortable with the full year outlook in terms of Evernorth income. Steven Valiquette : Perfect, thanks. Operator : Thank you Mr. Valiquette. Our next question comes from Mr. Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Nathan Rich : Thanks, good morning. I wanted to go back to the PBM and the regulatory focus, David. You mentioned that not all pharmacy benefit designs work for everyone. And the target, I think, of much of the legislation is focused on lowering out-of-pocket cost for patients. You've had plan options in the past that address some of these areas. I know you said that clients like having that choice. But are there -- is there any middle ground in terms of different solutions that you couldn't maybe roll out more broadly that would address some of these pain points kind of proactively ahead of maybe being forced legislatively? And I guess kind of my follow-up to that is client preferences I think kind of changed relatively slowly over time. I guess if we did see legislation go in place, how quickly could you kind of shift the client -- shift clients to new payment models to kind of adjust to a new regulatory backdrop? David Cordani : Good morning Nate. So first, on the affordability in the out-of-pocket, choices have been in the marketplace for some time. And important to note, by and large, as I noted before, on average those programs are working well in terms of the balance of overall affordability. And planned sponsors made trade-offs in terms of how much is put in premiums, how much is put in the benefits, etcetera from that standpoint. Two, just pointing you to specific because you said actions we could take, in 2019, we rolled out the first of its kind, the patient assurance program for insulin-dependent diabetics, cap monthly costs at $25 will stop. There's 11 million people benefiting from that program today as you see more focus relative to insulin. So we can have and will from that standpoint. Second, as you click down because, in many cases, the devils in the details, as you roll out new programs, you learn that, for example, some of the copay assurance programs can work in an HRA program, but in some cases don't work in a HSA program because of the regulatory requirement to the HSA program. They'll only work for preventative drugs, but they won't work for a broader class of drugs. So that now enables us to be more consultative with employers to make sure there's even a more pinpointed focus on benefit design and communication strategies as open enrollment happens because in some cases, an individual will enroll in an HSA, yet learn later that they have more dislocation in their out-of-pocket costs in a given month from the copay. So my point is actions taken, actions being taken, more precision that is necessary from that standpoint. As it relates to the -- how quickly we could pivot, we've proven tremendous flexibility in our model. Some of the additional data we're providing, we noted even last year at our Investor Day, we would continue to push ourselves with expanded disclosures and you're seeing more and more. We can pivot, we will pivot, we will continue to offer choice and the tools exist today as exemplary with our ClearCareRx program to provide further choice that use different financing mechanisms. So we are confident that we will be able to flex rapidly, if necessary. But we want to also ensure that we are a voice for employers to still work to preserve choices for them as how they want to finance their programs, how they want to manage their overall cost and predictability from that standpoint. But to reassure you, we have ample flexibility to flex rapidly. Operator : Thank you Mr. Rich. Our next question comes from Mr. A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. Albert Rice : Hi everybody. I guess I'll try to pivot away from the PBM question. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned your ongoing discussions with VillageMD about putting in place value-based contracting. I wonder if you can give us any further update on that, when you start to think about your 2024 bids commercially and MA, will any of those arrangements be part of the package that you offer or a factor in your bids and -- so it's about 2024 anything on the MA final rate notice and whether that changes your view on growth or margin trajectory that you're on in MA? David Cordani : A.J. good morning. You tucked a lot of questions in there, but let me start from the top. Relative to value-based care, before I hit the Village first, we've had a long commitment and positive track record relative to value-based care programs. Our orientation, as you may recall, is oriented around partnering, using data in collaborating with additional care extended resources to drive better, more consistent clinical outcomes and therefore overall value. Today, think about order of magnitude approaching 75% of our MA lives are in a value-based program. And depending on what you're looking at commercial or individual exchange, 40% or 50% of lives benefiting from the value-based program. And I'd underscore that we're seeing benefits from that in our continued market-leading lower medical cost trend. Specific to Village, we're pleased to advance and even further partnering more deeply with Village and collaborating with them. There are many ways in which we'll collaborate with Village to further accelerate value-based tier care traction off of their already successful model. I would note and highlight one of the portions that we are really excited about with Village is they've proven their current value-based care approach for commercial as well as Medicare Advantage. And our model with them has the ability to design and benefit from not only commercial and Medicare Advantage, but ASO and guaranteed cost as we bring more Evernorth services and collaborate with them as we curate more specialty networks, etcetera, going forward. As it relates to the part of your question, are there benefits in our current pricing as a result of our village initiative, they are starting to yield benefits already, starting to contribute to pricing in specific markets where the initiatives are underway is the headline. As it relates to your last question relative to big strategy, rate notice, etcetera, you should think about our view is our net rate for 2024 approximates the industry average. We take all the puts and takes that are framed in. Secondly, as you know, we're in the latter part of the bid cycle right now, so it would be premature and inappropriate for me to speak in any depth relative to our specific pricing strategy for 2024. We're pleased with our growth in 2023. We're pleased to see the 10% that we wheeled today and the traction in some of our markets that are maturing, and we will work on a market-by-market basis relative to the bid strategies and look forward to updates as we get into the second half of the year. Thanks, A.J. Operator : Thank you Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning. And I'll just echo how much we appreciate the comments on the PBM transparency there. I wanted to follow up with a couple of things on the PBM. The first is -- and so 20% of your profits come from those spread contracts and rebates. If the government did pass what they're talking about this year, how would -- how are your contracts structured such that you could pivot away, is that something that would have to happen over time, what would the near-term impact be versus the longer term? And then secondly, I've gotten a lot of questions on 340B given what one of your peers talked about is a pretty meaningful headwind versus their expectations this year. So curious if you can give us some color there in terms of maybe what percentage of earnings come from 340B or how your outlook has changed there within your [indiscernible]? Thanks. David Cordani : Good morning Justin. I'm going to take your questions. It's David. I'll take your questions in reverse order. Specific to 340B, we've seen some recent extrapolation of what potential exposure could be for us based upon what some others said or the size of certain other programs. I would start by saying we think those estimates are overstated. So now let me step back. By way of context, we do believe the 340B represents an important series of capabilities, in many cases, for hospitals to benefit from more affordable pharmaceuticals for underserved populations. Some pharmaceutical manufacturers have unilaterally removed or made it much more difficult for those hospitals to engender those benefits. By way of context, we saw deceleration, some deceleration in our volumes in the first half of 2022. We saw that deceleration trough mid-2022 and we saw volumes begin to increase in the second half of 2022 is different data sharing and other activities move forward. As it relates to our impact, we have factored into our plan for the year and our most recent updated outlook for the year, our best estimate, which includes some dampening of the overall program as it relates to our results, but I would stress, some of these extrapolation based on the size of certain other programs, we think is overstated. This is manageable within our portfolio and not a material driver of the overall Evernorth portfolio. As it relates to your first question, which I really appreciate, Justin, I can't give you a precise answer to your question. If we take a theoretical and say that legislation is passed tomorrow, that creates an immediacy, which we do believe will transpire. In fact, if you could look at some of the most recent dialogue coming out of committees and otherwise for the consideration of consideration of consideration being implemented in the latter half of 2025, for example, we don't think that theoretical exists. Having said that, you should think that we have contractual by and large, contractual frameworks that take into consideration unanticipated immediate legislative or regulatory movement. We don't believe that is the case. We will continue to advocate for our clients. We will continue to work to ensure that choice exist. And as we made clear, even with our ClearCareRx program, we have the tools and flexibility to deliver what a client wants from a choice standpoint, with or without sharing and being able to earn a sustained attractive margin for the value we create. Thanks, Justin. Operator : Thank you Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Ms. Erin Wright, Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Erin Wright : Hey, thanks. You mentioned some elevated disenrollment in the second half embedded in your guidance from a softening economy and can you quantify that range or how are you thinking about that and what are you seeing now and how did that change relative to what you were anticipating previously? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning Erin, it's Brian. So first of all, I just would reiterate, we're really pleased with the strong growth momentum across the Cigna Healthcare portfolio. When you think of our U.S. commercial Medicare Advantage and our U.S. individual business is all showing strong year-to-date results running ahead of expectations in aggregate for enrollment levels. And that builds upon our really strong performance in 2022, where we added nearly 1 million customers across the Cigna Healthcare platform. As I mentioned, we are not yet seeing signs of economic pressure in our book, for example, the disenrollment levels in the most recent months are very much in line with historical norms. But as I mentioned, we have assumed some level of elevated disenrollment in the back half of the year in order to be prudent. And in addition to that, we typically see some in-year attrition within the U.S. individual book over the course of a given calendar year. And as I mentioned, we still see organic growth in net client counts in the U.S. commercial business, particularly as the select segment continues its sales cycle through the balance of the year. And finally, we have not yet incorporated any assumption of potential volume for Medicaid redetermination. So that represents pure upside for us. And so should we not see economic weakness transpire later in the year or should we pick up some unexpected customers from the Medicaid redeterminations we may have some upside in our Cigna Healthcare customer accounts. Final comment I'll give you just in terms of sensitivities. In prior economic downturns, we've seen for every 1% change in the unemployment rate, our commercial employer levels enrollment levels will move by either 0.5% to 1% as it relates to 1% move in the unemployment rate. So it gives you a sense for the sensitivity relative to the size of the book as you think about how to model the rest of the year. Operator : Thank you Ms. Wright. Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. It seems like cost cut really wasn't a problem for you in the quarter, but still after earnings season is basically over, still trying to reconcile the strong numbers from the providers and the med tech companies with a relatively solid numbers from the managed care industry. Can you help reconcile what seems to be an apparent conflict and any color on cost trend, particularly, I guess, through the quarter and into this quarter would be helpful? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning Kevin, it's Brian. So just a few thoughts for you in terms of the reconciliation to the provider side, etcetera. I'd start by saying we're pleased to having delivered another strong quarter here of MCR performance in line or better than expected. So I'm pleased to start the year in that position. You can think of that as a function of the strong progress we've made in recent years with our affordability initiatives. So that includes items such as our provider contracting improvements, clinical program evolution, siding [ph] care optimization, along with our continued pricing discipline. So all that served us well, all while allowing us to grow 1.5 million customers year-to-date. As you think about the first quarter specifically, the favorability that we saw was driven by lighter-than-expected viral or respiratory claims. So in this case, think of COVID, flu, RSV in aggregate running a little bit lower than what we had been expecting. Now on the non-viral side, we had planned in price or normalized utilization levels to transpire in 2023 that were more consistent with pre-COVID levels. And during the first quarter, that's what we saw. We saw non-viral utilization, reflecting this more normalized pattern. But again, this was in line with our expectations that we had planned and priced for stepping into the year. Operator : Thank you Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Mr. Gary Taylor with Cowen. You may ask your question. Gary Taylor : Hey, good morning. Quick question. I do appreciate the PBM disclosure because obviously, if you're talking about 10% to 15% of the company's total earnings that you expect to retain it seems like the down 26% stock price is quite overdone this year. So I appreciate that. Are we going to see some of that financial disclosure in the 10-Q when you talk about new disclosure, will that be around some of the economics of retained spread in rebate? And then my second question is we did see the Florida pass or I believe, is going to be signed or just was signed by the Governor that would prohibit spread pricing in Florida across all lines of business. And just wondered what the -- if you knew what the implementation date on that was and just how quickly you had to sort of move to address that employer? Brian Evanko : Good morning Gary, it's Brian. I'll take your first question. I think David will comment on the situation that you referenced in Florida. As it relates to the incremental disclosures, so really, those were designed today to give all of our investors some further context on the earnings sources within Evernorth, just given the amount of misinformation in the ecosystem. And so alongside our 10-Q that we filed today, you'll find a supplemental disclosure that provides some additional qualitative information as well as some metrics that we think are important to help various stakeholders understand what the PBM does and doesn't do. And hopefully, we find that investors look at that as useful information. As it relates to some of the additional data points David and I shared, for example, the 20% of pretax adjusted earnings associated with PBM retained rebates and spread. As we referenced, that percentage has declined over time. At this point, we're not necessarily intending to update that every quarter in the Q but we will obviously give you context for how the earnings sources are evolving over time as that business continues to grow. David, do you want to comment on the... David Cordani : Sure. Good morning Gary, relative to the Florida activity, one of the two components we talked about. We talked about rebates. This is specific to your question relative to spread. We're still working through the details from a state standpoint. Interesting timing as well. We literally have our large client gathering that is taking place as we speak. This is a topic of discussion for clients in terms of digesting the ramifications. We'll have the ability to flex our capabilities as I noted in prior questions relative to this one aspect as it's implemented. I don't want to go any further in terms of quantifying or otherwise. Big picture, it's manageable. Specifically, we'll work through client by client, the impacts relative to their respective forward footprint and then considerations on a go-forward basis as to whether or not they want to flex financing mechanisms for other geographies going forward, using our capabilities. But we have the ability to flex, and we will be compliant, obviously, with the implementation time line. Gary Taylor : Thanks, appreciate it. Operator : Thank you Mr. Taylor. Our next question comes from Mr. Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question. Stephen Baxter : Hi, Yes, I wanted to ask about ClearCareRx. I guess, first, how quickly do you think this model will be adopted, is there any kind of target for this that you can share? And then obviously, your clients are sophisticating of access to pools to evaluate your economics during RFPs. But how do you think about competitive dynamics of the industry as a whole over time could be progressing to explicit fee-based pricing models? Thanks. David Cordani : Good morning. Stephen, the ClearCareRx program, as I noted previously, we've worked for about two years with a small number, think of a dozen large sophisticated clients to design this program to work through the program to perfect aspects in a program, and we're excited to roll it out on a more extensive basis. Two, I would think about the addressable market as more the larger of the large clients working down given the immediacy of pass-through and then the potential cash flow management ramifications that it creates from that standpoint. So this will be another choice that's offered in the marketplace. I think to your broader question, inferred to your broader question, the relentless of ongoing commitment to innovation is mission-critical in any industry. In this subset of our industries, it's mission-critical and we're proud of the fact that we had leadership relative to a variety of programs. As I mentioned, insulin programs, as we talked before about our Embark program on high-cost gene therapies, our SafeGuardRx program, that is benefiting all of our clients relative to care management programs. TRCs, as you know, more therapeutic resource groups and centers that come together and focus on specific diagnosis and have detailed expertise and then how they're coordinated with the medical professionals and how they coordinated with the behavioral professionals are mission critical. So the path of innovation and whether it is, to your point, a fee-based environment that transpires may transpire. However, having the choice, we think, is mission critical. Finally, for you and maybe the broader audience, we may see some similarities as we've seen in the medical space where as you think about our approach, I mean, the medical benefit space, our approach was broad funding mechanisms and financing mechanisms, an agnostic model, meaning we could flex in any of them, whether it's self-funded, self-funded with stop loss on risk management, a share return model, or a guaranteed cost model. And we see those same trends manifesting in the pharmacy space and we're in a position to lead there. So largest of large employers, two years in its design, it's perfected and it's ready to scale. We don't think the entire market shifts to this in 2024. We think there'll be more adoption of programs like ClearCareRx, and we're happy to be the leader in the space. Operator : Thank you Mr. Baxter. Our next question comes from Mr. Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question. Joshua Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could give us some more color on the individual book. It looks like it came in maybe 100,000 or so more than expected. Maybe where did those lives come from and was that the reason for the increased total membership guidance? And then maybe any early signs on utilization and other metrics that give you comfort that you priced that business correctly? Brian Evanko : Good morning Josh, it's Brian. So overall, the strong individual customer growth in 2023, you can think of as a combination of a few things. So one, obviously, the industry had some strong growth rates from 2022 into 2023. We also had some new market entries and there were some competitors that exited certain geographies where we participate in. And if you think about the sources of that, our growth came from a combination of existing geographies and those three new states that we stepped into, which were Texas, Indiana, and South Carolina here in 2023. We did see the majority of our growth come from three states in particular. So Texas, Georgia and Florida drove the majority of the growth not any one specific city, we're in multiple locations in those states. Fortunately, we have a long history in these geographies that goes well beyond the U.S. individual business, meaning our commercial and MA businesses has been operating in those locations for some time. So our provider engagement and clinical programs should benefit these individual customers as well. Now for purposes of the claims experience and the margins, etcetera, for the 2023 calendar year, we continue to expect the margins on this book will run below our long-term goal, which is 4% to 6% in our Cigna Healthcare income and MCR guidance reflects this. So we expect to run below that 4% to 6% long-term goal. Given the substantial amount of new customers we've added in 2023, we think this is a prudent assumption to make from the standpoint of the margins running below that long-term target. While it's early in the year so far, the claims are largely in line with our expectations through the first quarter. And importantly, as you think about the first quarter actuals as well as our full year outlook, we've assumed that we will be in a risk adjustment payable position for the 2023 plan year despite the fact that we were in a receivable position for the 2022 plan year. So again, we think that's a prudent assumption to make at this early juncture in the year until later. And in 2023 when we see some industry-wide risk adjustment data that will help us to recalibrate that assumption. As you think about the longer run, this is a book of business that does represent a source of future embedded earnings power that will help contribute to the segment's long-term margin expansion and income growth. So overall, a good start to the year. Still a long way to go for the full year, and we think we've taken a prudent posture as it relates to the accruals. Operator : Thank you Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Mr. Scott Fidel with Stephens. You may ask your question. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I would be interested if you could maybe just drill in a bit more into your latest thinking on both the GLP-1 drugs and then the emerging Alzheimer's drugs, maybe give us just some insights from both the Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth business segment perspectives? Thanks. David Cordani : Good morning Scott, it's David. Clearly, the GLP-1 drugs have been in the price pretty significantly. And by way of headline, we think the drugs and the treatment protocols represent a positive step forward specifically for diabetics as such. We have coverage within our formulary. I would remind you that early on when the first within the class came out, we actually stepped in with some value-based care arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers and have seen positive contributions for both the benefit of patients as well as our clients. But to date, I'd also add that employers have had a more limited appetite to expand coverage beyond clinical diagnoses such as diabetes for certain lifestyle treatments. There has been some, but we've seen more limited adoption of that thus far. And on a go-forward basis, we would expect to have our P&T committee and our internal clinical oversight continue to monitor the progress relative to ongoing testing development in this important class. I would take that trend and carry it across similarly relative to the Alzheimer's space, clearly, a lot of interest excitement and demand for drugs within the Alzheimer's space to help a growing population confronting this challenging disease from that standpoint. We've seen more limited adoption thus far. We see some early data like you're seeing right now relative to next-in-class [Technical Difficulty] seeming to demonstrate some promise going through FDA, working through CMS relative to Medicare reimbursement, and we will stay tightly aligned relative to that. On a final note, if you put a circle around this, I think you've heard in the latter part of your question, you can think about these drugs is, in some cases, creating cost on the benefit side of the equation with an offset of a benefit, clearly. But you should also think about the Cigna Group's portfolio because of Evernorth is having some dimension of a natural hedge given the size and sophistication and reach of our pharmacy and specialty pharmacy programs and the breadth of the clients we're able to serve within that portfolio. So we see this as a growth opportunity within the Evernorth portfolio and the clinical depth we have in there in terms of coordinating services for individuals will be helpful in terms of ensuring that the value is delivered. So emerging space in both categories some promise, early adoption, some track record in value-based care. And importantly, I would underscore, we have a natural hedge relative to some cost pressure you would think about in the benefit space through our high-performing services space. Operator : Thank you Mr. Fidel. Our last question comes from Kevin -- Mr. Kevin Caliendo with UBS. You may ask your question. Kevin Caliendo : Great. Thanks for getting me in. Getting back to the 20% of Evernorth earnings, does that include the ESI rebates and pass-through and spread, does that also account for the medical profit like the pharmacy profit in the Medical segment as well or is that separate? And since you've been in such a giving mood, can you provide us -- is there any transparency on that number? Brian Evanko : Good morning Kevin, it's Brian. So the 20% that we made reference to is the PBM retained rebates and the retail spread that comprise the Evernorth segment's contribution specifically. So as with all of our clients of Evernorth, whether they be the Cigna Healthcare affiliated health plan or our unaffiliated health plan clients, they choose how they would like to use the pharmacy value that we create for them. So to your question, if there are pharmacy earnings in the Cigna Healthcare segment, that's not reflected in the 20% metric we're specifically dimensioning the Evernorth contribution. And then like I said, the Cigna Healthcare health plan decides how they choose to deploy any value that's created from Evernorth to sister company. David, maybe you want to pile on here? David Cordani : And Kevin to add on that, as you think about the health plans that are served by Evernorth, if you consider the total cost of care, a health plan through their medical contracting, ancillary contracting, pharmacy contract behavioral contracting, aggregate a total cost of care to generate their price point. So in the case of a guaranteed cost offering or a risk-based offering, the cost of the pharmaceuticals are baked into that from that standpoint, whether that's commercial, individual exchange business, or Medicare Advantage business for health plan. So that's value delivered just like the value that's delivered for their medical contracting, their DME contracting, their behavioral contracting, etcetera, and part of their overall cost equation that they'll factor into the net pricing that they're offering to the marketplace. Kevin Caliendo : Appreciate it, thanks guys. Operator : Thank you Mr. Caliendo. I will turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : Thanks again for joining our call today. Let me just reinforce a couple of quick points. One, we are confident that we will deliver our increased adjusted EPS, revenue and customer growth outlook for this year. To do that, our team remains focused on everyone we serve and is executing with good focus and discipline, all while we continue to innovate. We will also continue our leadership in working to improve health care, including our increased transparency, choice and clinical programs to drive down further drug costs for our customers, our patients and our clients. I would want to underscore that the progress we continue to make all starts with in is fueled by the dedication and commitment of our 70,000 coworkers around the world who I want to thank for their commitment and demonstration every day to working to make a very positive difference in the people's lives we are able to serve both formally through our commercial relationships as well as in the communities we serve each and every day. Finally, thank you for joining our call. And as always, we look forward to our continued discussions in the future.

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and we'll review procedures on how to enter queue to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder ladies and gentlemen, this call, including the question-and-answer session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, The Cigna Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Evanko, Chief Financial Officer; and Eric Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evernorth Health Services. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including our second quarter financial results and our updated financial outlook for 2023. Following their prepared remarks David, Brian, and Eric will be available for Q&A. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of thecignagroup.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2023 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Regarding our results, in the second quarter, we recorded after-tax special item charges of $5 million, or $0.01 per share, for the integration and transaction-related costs. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2023 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2023 dividends. With that, I will turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. For the second quarter, again, we delivered a strong performance, fueled by continued growth across our diverse portfolio of businesses. Today, I will review key strategic drivers contributing to our momentum and why we believe we are well-positioned to sustain our growth as we continue to support the health and vitality of those we serve with our differentiated solutions and capabilities. Brian will cover additional details about our financial performance in the quarter and our 2023 outlook. As part of our ongoing effort for you to hear more from members of our leadership team Eric Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evernorth Health Services, will be joining our call and is available to take your questions. With that, let's get started. In the second quarter, we delivered total revenues of $48.6 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $6.13 and cash flow from operations of $2.5 billion. We are pleased with our performance overall during the quarter and through the first half of the year. With focus on affordability and innovation, we are continuing to strengthen our competitive position and grow our businesses. In Evernorth Health Services, we saw another strong quarter of our market-leading pharmacy, care and benefits portfolio. Express Scripts, our pharmacy benefits business, harnesses our deep relationships, extensive clinical expertise and is delivering innovations and innovative solutions for those we serve. We've long been a leader in supporting access to prescription drugs and, to further enhance our efforts, we took a series of actions in the quarter, including launching Copay Assurance to support further affordability for patients, and ClearCareRX to provide our clients with broader choice. We also introduced [Independent Rx] (ph), which is a first-of-its-kind support program for rural pharmacists that recognizes the critical role they play in improving access for millions of Americans. We will continue to lead the way through the current environment of elevated legislative and regulatory activity and we are encouraged by the positive recognition of our work to make safe, effective and affordable access of prescription drugs within reach for millions of people who need them. Our client retention is also strong, and we are continuing to build and expand new relationships. For example, we are making good progress for implementation with Centene, which begins on January of 2024. Our teams are working collaboratively and we are on track as we prepare to further improve affordability in serving 20 million Centene customers. In the quarter, we had strong growth in Accredo, our specialty pharmacy business. In a moment, I'll profile the deep clinical expertise and capabilities that make Accredo a differentiated leader in this space. Turning to Cigna Healthcare, we delivered another quarter of organic customer growth, reinforcing how well our consultative approach and capabilities continue to resonate in the market. Our U.S. commercial business continues to build momentum. We've had sustained success with commercial customer growth outpacing the overall market and 2023 is shaping up to be another very strong year for this business. With our affordability initiatives and deep consultative sales approach, we are delivering highly competitive total cost of care for employer clients, as well as providing programs supporting healthy engaged workforces that they need. In U.S. government, our Medicare Advantage business is achieving above-market customer growth with high-quality affordable plans and targeted investments that we continue to make to further strengthen our network and offerings. In our individual exchange business, we will continue taking a focused approach by engaging customers to improve health outcomes and managing risks in the expanding population we serve. In the quarter, while our medical care ratio was generally in line with expectations, we did have an increase to our 2023 risk adjustment payable. Relative to the risk [adjuster] (ph) impact, we expect this to be a 2023 event, and we've already taken actions for 2024. And in our international health business, we drove continued innovation and growth in target markets with solutions for the [globally mobile] (ph) population and employees of multinational corporations as well as intergovernmental organizations. Overall, our second quarter results showed that The Cigna Group is performing well with underlying strength in our complementary businesses. We believe we are well-positioned to continue growing our company and delivering on our commitments. With the strength of our results, we are increasing our outlook for full year revenue and customer growth, as well as cash flow from operations, and we are reaffirming that we are on track to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $24.70 for full year 2023. Now, I will talk about how we are working to sustain our momentum with our differentiated and diversified capabilities and our durable strategic growth framework. Our framework guides us in continuing to respond to customer, patient and client needs, as well as capturing growth opportunities within our foundational businesses and our accelerated growth businesses. Additionally, we harness the power of our talent, client relationships and partnerships, as well as an expanding technology portfolio for cross-enterprise leverage. Technology increasingly provides us with opportunities to accelerate innovation and growth. Artificial intelligence and machine learning, for example, are capabilities further enhancing ways for us to support patients and their clinical care teams, as well as drive additional efficiency initiatives. Today, I'll talk more about one of our accelerated growth businesses, Accredo, our flagship specialty pharmacy, where we have a competitive advantage in an area of growing needs and opportunity. Earlier this summer, we welcomed a group of investors to Warrendale, Pennsylvania at one of our Accredo clinical care sites. The visit provided an opportunity to see the breadth of our specialty capabilities and the depth of our clinical expertise, a critical driver for the positive outcomes and impact we achieve for patients requiring complex and high-cost treatments for chronic conditions. Here are a few headlines from the day at Warrendale. First, Accredo has a proven track record of growth. Nearly five years ago when Express Scripts combined with Cigna, Accredo was approximately a $30 billion business. Today, Accredo has grown to approximately $60 billion. And in 2023, serves approximately 900,000 patients with some of the most complex conditions and needs. Accredo now represents about 40% of Evernorth's total revenue, and because of its unique strengths, Accredo has grown faster than the overall marketplace. Second, these secular tailwinds in the market create significant growth opportunities as we look to the future. Those who need specialty drugs make up about 5% of the population and they drive more than 40% of total healthcare costs across medical, behavioral and pharmacy services. This is fueling expected mid to high single-digit annual growth in what is already a specialty pharmaceutical market of approximately $380 billion. Biosimilars represent force of change and a substantial opportunity for further growth and impact, and we will leverage them for greater affordability for clients and patients. We've long been a leader in supporting greater adoption of biosimilars as we did with the wave of generic medications when they became available decades ago. And like generics, we believe biosimilars will drive much-needed affordability improvements for those we serve and thereby create more financial capacity to pay for new pharmaceutical innovations today and as we look to the future. Third is the breadth of our clinical capabilities and use of data that further fuels precision and impact. We built and strengthened our clinical capabilities and far-reaching operating model over decades. Within Accredo, we have therapeutic resource centers with clinical teams of pharmacists, nurses, dietitians and social workers specializing in different disease states, such as blood and neurological disorders and multiple types of cancers. Unlike many of our competitors, we directly employ hundreds of field-based infusion nurses. Today, they are located within 75 miles of approximately 90% of the U.S. population. And as they care for patients inside their homes, they provide better, more coordinated and personalized experiences, including addressing social determinants of health. With the clinical care model focused on each individual patient, we are able to provide a level of personalized clinical support that is vital in specialty pharmacy. Many new high-cost drugs for oncology, gene therapies and rare conditions are coming to market, further pressuring affordability for clients and requiring greater support for patients that take these complex medications safely and effectively. I would note, drug manufacturers also recognize our expertise and capabilities, as well as our superior outcomes that we produce with our unique, coordinated clinical model. Putting all this together, we are excited about the accelerated growth opportunities we have with Accredo's differentiated specialty pharmacy, and view it as a powerful growth engine for our company today and into the future. Now, stepping back to the enterprise level, I'll briefly recap. We drove strong earnings that built on our momentum from the first quarter and last year. We delivered adjusted EPS of $6.13, strong customer, revenue and cash flow growth. Our progress gives us confidence to reaffirm our guidance of adjusted EPS of at least $24.70 for full year 2023, and we also remain on track for adjusted EPS of at least $28.00 in 2024. This reinforces how we are creating value for our customers and clients and leveraging differentiated capabilities to give us flexibility to continue performing well in a dynamic environment. Now, Brian will share additional perspective about our performance in the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Brian? Brian Evanko : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review Cigna's second quarter 2023 results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year. Second quarter results were strong, reflecting continued execution across the enterprise. Looking at the quarter specifically, some key consolidated financial highlights include : revenue growth of 7% to $48.6 billion; after-tax adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion; adjusted earnings per share of $6.13; and cash flow from operations of $2.5 billion. Revenue and cash flow both exceeded expectations, while adjusted earnings per share were slightly ahead of expectations. Our two platforms continue to perform well, with Evernorth posting solid top- and bottom-line growth, while Cigna Healthcare delivered results in line with expectations despite an unfavorable risk adjustment impact in our individual exchange business, which I will discuss shortly. First, turning to Evernorth results. Evernorth continues to deliver strong performance. With second quarter 2023 revenues growing 10% to $38.2 billion and pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by continued strong performance in our differentiated specialty pharmacy business, which had year-over-year revenue growth in the mid-teens, and our focus on providing a variety of solutions that drive affordability and lowest net cost for our customers and clients. Additionally, we continue to build out our cross-enterprise leverage capabilities, harnessing data and technology to accelerate innovation for customers and clients. And we also continue to make strategic investments to further enhance and expand our client relationships, diversify our portfolio of products and services, prepare for new clients in 2024, and advance our technology capabilities. Overall, Evernorth has delivered strong first half results and we are well-positioned as we look to the back half of the year. Our diversified solutions allow us to sustain momentum by delivering differentiated value to our customers and clients, helping them overcome key healthcare challenges. Turning to Cigna Healthcare. Second quarter 2023 adjusted revenues grew 12% to $12.7 billion. Pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.2 billion and the medical care ratio was 81.2%. The medical care ratio reflects some items specific to our individual exchange business that largely offset one another in the quarter. After receiving our first view of industry-wide risk adjustment data in early July, we increased our full year 2023 estimated individual exchange risk adjustment payable. It's important to note, this was primarily driven by two states. Within those two states, the unfavorable impact from the first half of 2023 was about $80 million, and was recognized in the second quarter. We expect a similar magnitude of impact in the back half of the year. Additionally, this impact is isolated to the 2023 calendar year, as we have taken corrective pricing actions and the impact to geographies in our 2024 rate filings. Specific to the second quarter, the unfavorable risk adjustment payable impact was largely offset by a favorable update to our 2022 risk adjustment receivable within the individual exchange business. Underlying fundamentals across the Cigna Healthcare segment continued to perform well as we further expanded our relationships and delivered affordability for our customers and clients. As we have mentioned on prior calls, we planned and priced for more normalized levels of utilization this year. Our year-to-date claims experience has been broadly in line with this expectation across both Commercial and Medicare Advantage. Turning to Cigna Healthcare medical customers. We ended the quarter with 19.5 million total medical customers, growth of approximately 1.5 million customers year-to-date across all businesses. Within our government business, medical customers grew sequentially, and year-to-date, Medicare Advantage has grown 12%. Overall, Cigna Healthcare's results in the quarter were solid as we demonstrated strong underlying fundamentals, despite the increased 2023 individual exchange risk adjustment payable previously mentioned, and we continue to grow our customer and client relationships, providing differentiated value and driving affordability. Now, turning to our outlook for full year 2023. We have increased our expectations for full year 2023 consolidated adjusted revenues to at least $190 billion, driven by continued strength in our businesses as we continue to deliver innovative services and solutions for the benefit of our customers, patients and clients. We are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share outlook of at least $24.70 per share, and we expect adjusted EPS to be split approximately evenly between the third and fourth quarters. In Evernorth, we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $6.4 billion. With respect to Evernorth earnings cadence, we expect mid-single digit year-over-year adjusted earnings growth in the third quarter, and mid to high single-digit adjusted earnings growth in the fourth quarter. In Cigna Healthcare, we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $4.425 billion. We expect third quarter Cigna Healthcare adjusted earnings to be slightly below 55% of second half adjusted earnings to reflect seasonal patterns as well as the rate and pace of investments. This incorporates the impact from the estimated individual exchange risk adjustment payable in the second half of the year, which is offset by other items in Cigna Healthcare, including expense efficiencies. Additionally, we continue to expect our 2023 medical care ratio to be within the range of 81.5% to 82.3%. Switching gears, let's move to our 2023 capital management position and outlook. Year-to-date through August 2, 2023, we have repurchased approximately $3.8 million shares of common stock for approximately $1.1 billion. The continued strength of our cash generation gives us the confidence to increase our full year 2023 expected cash flow from operations by $500 million to at least $9.5 billion for the full year. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remain strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based model that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. Now, to recap, second quarter results were strong, reflecting high-quality underlying fundamentals in our foundational and accelerated businesses, giving us confidence to deliver on our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance of at least $24.70, and we continue to expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $28.00, consistent with our prior commentary. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. Scott Fidel with Stephens. You may ask your question. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Appreciate the color on the risk adjustment dynamics. I think that helps also explain some of the rate increases that we've seen you filing in some of those pertinent states like Georgia for 2024. My question is if we back out the risk adjustment impacts from both '22 and '23, can you give us an update on how you view sort of underlying utilization and cost trends in the marketplace and the individual business for 2023? And how you'd say sort of core, I guess, exchange margins are tracking towards your longer-term view in '23? And as you put these price increases in for '24, how that will sync up relative to the long-term sort of 4% to 6% pre-tax margins that you've historically sort of managed the individual business for? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Scott. It's Brian. I'll try to take each of those bites kind of one at a time. So, as I mentioned in my comments, in the quarter, we had an $80 million impact from the risk adjustment payable matter in 2023, which reflects essentially a true-up for the first two quarters of the year. But that was largely offset in the quarter by the favorable true-up we had on the 2022 risk adjustment settlement. The other residual piece within the individual exchange business is we had some favorable claim cost experience in the first half of the year. So, the $80 million was offset largely by the 2022 risk adjustment settlement, but also, to a lesser degree, by favorable cost trend within our individual exchange business, which reflects a younger, healthier population than what we had in 2022. So claim costs there, certainly within check, but we had the larger payable, which creates the pressure point for the year. As it relates to the profit margins and how to think about where we are in '23 and the rate increase impact on '24, just for some context here, you can think of this business being approximately a $5 billion block for us in 2023 in terms of premium revenue. And we had shared on a prior call that we were anticipating the individual exchange book to run below our target margins within 2023. As you noted, our long-term target for this business is 4% to 6%. For the remainder of this year, we're expecting another $80 million of risk adjustment payable impact across the second half, which, as I mentioned, will be offset by the strength across the broader Cigna Healthcare portfolio, including expense efficiencies. But when you put all this together, the individual exchange margins in 2023 will be below our prior estimates. And for 2024, we have taken sizable price increases in our two largest states. So we would expect some degree of margin expansion in the individual exchange book overall in '24 relative to '23. The exact amount of that margin improvement will end up being a function of our geographic and customer mix in 2024 as we are likely to have fewer customers in the individual exchange business in 2024 relative to where we are in 2023. So, thanks for the question. Hopefully, you can follow all those moving pieces. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fidel. Our next question comes from Mr. A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. I know at this point in the year, large employers are well on their way to thinking about their '24 outlook as -- both from health benefits and also on the pharmacy benefit side. I wondered if given you've got a great window on all of that, anything interesting to call out in terms of priorities for employers around benefit design, focus on particular categories of healthcare, whether -- I know sometimes it's diabetes, sometimes family planning. Anything on the cost management focus? I know there's a lot of discussion about GLP-1s, and wonder whether they're focused on trying to manage that more effectively. And then, just overall expectations in those customers around cost trends and -- are they assuming it's sort of a more normalized outlook going into '24, or are they making any assumptions about pent-up demand or anything? David Cordani : A.J., good morning. It's David. Let me describe a little bit of the -- we'll say the buying characteristics and areas of focus in the market more broadly, and then I'll ask Eric to give you a little bit more color in terms of the pharmacy specific space and using your GLP-1 as an example. So, stepping back, and it's for the latter part of your comment to reinforce it, the buying behaviors continue to have an intense focus on, what I will call, base buying needs focused on affordability, coupled with consistent high-quality service levels. There's two additional dimensions, I would say, that have intensified recently relative to need state. One, as employers, because you're coming at through the employee lens, continue to intensify their focus on having healthy, engaged, highly-productive workforce. They're intensifying their focus and need and awareness of the complex behavioral health needs from their population, inclusive of, but also beyond the more intense behavioral health dimensions. This includes anxiety, stress, depression and complexity to come along with that. Here, I would note that within our Cigna Group portfolio of solutions, we're well positioned to meet the needs, because there's a lot of coordination that's necessary to advance there. The second trend I'd highlight is what the marketplace is sometimes calling point solution fatigue, where over time, employers have aggregated many individual point solutions that made sense at a given moment in time, but they find themselves stepping back and looking at that inventory, questioning whether or not either, a, they're getting all the value out of each individual solution, or b, the friction and/or abrasion for their coworkers or medical professionals is worth the value of the fractured point solutions, and therefore, are challenging more opportunities to coordinate or integrate solutions to get more value, leverage and better service from that standpoint. And again, our portfolio is really well positioned there and continues to resonate in the market as evidenced by our growth. I'll ask Eric to provide a little bit of color of areas of focus for buyers more broadly in pharmacy, including the GLP-1. Eric Palmer : Great. Thanks, David. Good morning, A.J. I'll start with the GLP-1. GLP-1s are definitely top of mind for many of our clients. There's been a meaningful uptick in utilization here. And as I think you know, we have coverage for these medications on our formularies from early on for value-based arrangements with pharma manufacturers. We've seen contributions for the benefit of patients and our clients by result of those -- the structures. We have recently launched a program called ENCIRCLERX, which brings together management of the GLP-1, cardiac, diabetic conditions, obesity. So these conditions often tend to be interrelated, to bring together a benefit plan design, the clinical support as necessary and the overall resources we can bring to help these patients, better manage their health and ultimately get to a better plan costs. So, at GLP-1 and the broader cardiac, obesity, diabetes space is a real area of focus. I would also note, as David touched on in his comments, continued interest in behavioral solutions. That's an area that we've got strong expertise within Evernorth, and we're excited about the opportunities in that market and the need to help manage behavioral care more effectively. Those will probably be the top couple of specific themes I would call out at this point, A.J. A.J. Rice: All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Justin Lake : Thanks. A couple of quick questions. One, just so I appreciate your comments on cost trend, but did see a pretty big pickup in medical costs payable in the quarter relative to reserve growth. Just curious what drove that. And then, just stepping back, the stop loss business has seen a nice acceleration this year, up in the teens. Just curious what you're seeing there. And do you expect that to be the kind of the trajectory after we've seen a bit of a slowdown over the last few years? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Justin. It's Brian. I'll start, and I think David will pile on in terms of the stop loss component. So, as it relates to our medical cost payables or reserves, nothing particular I'd flag here. We continue to employ a consistent methodology as it relates to how we set our reserves. There'll be some natural variability in this metric as product mix shift tends to occur from quarter-to-quarter. And I know the days claims payable metric is one that's commonly looked at. We don't target or forecast any specific level of DCP rather this is more the output of our detailed assumption setting that's -- then aggregated up to the enterprise level. So, we remain comfortable with our reserving methodology and confidence in the adequacy of the balance sheet. As it relates to stop loss, you're right, we're seeing nice growth in that product line. We've got 13% year-on-year premium growth. We're on track to achieve our target profitability in that business this year. So nice performance, and it continues to resonate with our clients. David, anything you want to add in that regard? David Cordani : Yes. Thanks, Brian. And good morning, Justin. The item I amplify is, Justin, as you recall from prior conversations, part of our consultative approach and go-to-market approach is when you work with clients of a variety of sizes around the benefit design that matches their strategy, the clinical programs in support of that, that match your strategy, the service support programs that match your strategy. The final thing we work on is the funding mechanism. And as the market conditions change, we have the ability to flex between risk or guarantee cost, shared returns and/or self-funded with stop loss. And our stop loss program, as you call out, continues to perform well, grow well and resonate in the marketplace because it provides that peace of mind and predictability for employers around their cash flow and any dislocation that may happen in a given year. So, our specialists in that space have a high-performing book. It continues to resonate well. And you'll see ebb and flow over time based on market buying conditions, but continued growth. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Ms. Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good morning. I just want to come back to the pharmacy side of the business for a minute and ask a couple of questions. One, when I think about the quarter, can you talk about the margin impact from : one, GLP-1s? I know you talked about strength there; two, the shift to biosimilars?; and three, the Centene implementation costs? Can you just talk about how each of those had an impact on the margin in the quarter? And then, just as a follow-up, when you talked about the 2024 selling season, more specific on the PBM side, can you maybe just give a little more detail as to how renewals went and what your retention rates are expected to be for '24? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Lisa. It's Brian. I'll start. I think that's a multiparter, and then Eric is going to chime in with some comments on the sales season. But as it relates to the quarter, overall, Evernorth continues to perform really well. So, I'd start there. Largely in line with our expectations when you put all the different moving pieces together. The individual components you kind of called out there, Eric referenced earlier, GLP-1 utilization does continue to build, which in the Evernorth business is a positive contributor to our earnings at this point in time, whether that be for diabetic indications or non-diabetic indications. So that's certainly a net positive relative to the Evernorth business in 2023. On the biosimilar side of the house, you should think of, thus far, relatively low adoption of Amjevita in the first half of the year. On the second half of the year, we obviously added two additional biosimilars into the National Preferred Formulary. And one of the reasons we expect acceleration in income growth in the third and fourth quarter is the impact of greater biosimilar adoption as well as improved overall positioning relative to the dynamics of competitiveness across the four drugs that will be on the National Preferred Formulary. But in the second quarter, I wouldn't characterize biosimilars as a particular driver of the margin profile. On the Centene impact, we remain very much on track relative to the implementation against our commitments. As we mentioned before, we expect to spend about $200 million over the course of 2023. You should think of that as gradually building quarter-to-quarter over the course of the year. And so, the money is being spent as we speak. And all those factors did impact the second quarter. But again, nothing in particular I would call out being significantly deviating from our expectations compared to what we expected three months ago. Eric, maybe you can pick up both on Centene and the selling season. Eric Palmer : Great. Thanks, Brian. And good morning, Lisa. So, just a couple of other comments that I had on Centene. I'm really pleased with how we are working together to deliver an implementation program to serve Centene's customers. We are on track, and there's good momentum in the readiness for our January '24 implementation. So, continue to be excited about that opportunity. With respect to the selling season more broadly, we operate in a competitive market, and the strength of our solutions really continues to resonate. We will deliver another strong retention rate. As we look to the 2024, I think mid-90%-s or higher, and consistent with our prior commentary around what a strong retention rate looks like. We'll have additional new growth, new client wins on top of the large Centene win as well. So, feeling good as we kind of wind down the 2024 selling season at this point, and we'll provide more detail on that when we provide our 2024 guidance later on. Lisa Gill : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Gill. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. I wanted to get a little more color on the increased enrollment outlook. I guess you've indicated in the past that you're being a little bit concerned about recessions and determinations. Were those -- anything changed there to drive that? Or was it new customer growth? Just a little color. Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Kevin. It's Brian. So, I'll start, and I think your question is specific to Cigna Healthcare, which is where I'll go. So, first off, we're really pleased with the strong growth momentum across the Cigna Healthcare book. If you look at our year-to-date customer growth, it's running ahead of expectations at $1.5 million net growth, and that builds off of a strong performance we had in 2022, where we added nearly 1 million customers across the Cigna Healthcare platform. As it relates to our refreshed membership outlook for the year, you can think of the primary driver of that being an elevated expectation for individual exchange customers by year-end 2023. The other components of the Cigna Healthcare customer outlook are broadly unchanged from our prior projections. We're not yet seeing meaningful signs of any economic pressure within our commercial book of business. But that said, we have assumed some elevated disenrollment in the U.S. commercial business in the second half of 2023 in order to be prudent. We continue to exclude any potential Medicaid redetermination lives from our commercial forecast for the balance of the year. And taken all together, again, pleased to see a full year outlook of 8% growth in total medical customers across Cigna Healthcare. One minor refinement we made this year or this quarter relative to the individual exchange business is, we are now forecasting some level of Medicaid redeterminations coming in through the balance of the year. So, you should think of the commercial business, excluding Medicaid redetermination, the individual forecast now including some level of redeterminations for the balance of the year. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. Just clarification on the exchange true-ups and the impact there. I just want to make sure I get this right. I assume you've got a bigger payable, but that probably means that your claims costs are coming in a little bit better. So I just want to see if there's actually -- and offset from the receivable from last year. So I just want to see if there's actually an EPS impact expected for this year. And then my real question is, just could you speak to your MA bid strategy for 2024? I'm specifically interested in how you're thinking about benefit design in light of rates and the risk model changes? And then, if there's anything to talk about the VillageMD partnership, if that impacts any way you're bidding in certain markets? Brian Evanko : Good morning, Josh. It's Brian. So, I'll take the first one, and then David will pick up on the Medicare Advantage question. So, as it relates to the different payable dynamics, let me try to give you the full picture here. So, just for some context, we ended the quarter with about 820,000 customers in the individual exchange business. That was up significantly from where we were at the end of 2022. And during the 2022 year, we were in a risk adjustment receivable position on this business. So, when we stepped into '23, we had been anticipating that, that would switch over and that will -- we'd be in a payable position for 2023. The first look we got at the industry-wide risk adjustment data that we received in early July indicated that we'll be in an even greater payable position for the 2023 plan year, and that was driven by two large states. Those two large states represent about half of the individual exchange premium base. And the adjustment in the first half of the year that came through the second quarter was an $80 million increase in the payable. That was offset largely by a favorable true-up on the 2022 receivable. You can think of that in the range of about $50 million. And then the residual is primarily driven by favorable claim costs in 2023 relative to our expectations. So that favorability in the 2023 claim costs partially offset the increased payable that we have -- that ran through the second quarter. So hopefully, that helps to square the picture a little bit on the individual exchange business. David, do you want to pick up on MA? David Cordani : Sure, Brian, thanks. Good morning, Josh. So, you had two questions. Specific to MA and our bid strategy, I'll just speak more broadly. I'm not going to go into detail specifically, Josh, just to manage expectations given the time cycle and the competitive nature. First and foremost, as I noted, we're pleased with our growth in 2023, point one. Two, as we look to 2024 to some of the points you made reference to, we expect to see larger-than-average local market variability in terms of offering and positioning by competitors. And at this point, I would highlight and reinforce that we remain convicted to and comfortable with our bid assumptions relative to underlying medical costs based upon what we've seen through the first two quarters of the year and our outlook for the year. I'd also note that our [stars] (ph) position coming into the cycle is consistent and strong and our early look at the stars on a go-forward basis remains consistent and strong from that standpoint. Specifically to your last point around Village, first and foremost, I'd ask you to think about initiating the relationship with Village, we seek to have a long-term strategic positive impact. I would note that day one for the benefit of our customers who are experiencing Village and Summit relationships, they began to see benefits immediately by the nature of the structure of our relationship. And then, we continue to collaborate, innovate on value-based care, whether it's leveraging some Evernorth capabilities like behavioral, virtual or other services, and/or go more deeply into individual markets around more precisely leveraging data and insights to curate sub-specialty networks to get the best possible quality and cost and affordability. That benefit will continue to mount as we go forward, and to the core of your question, contribute to market by market, our posture in MA. But specifically, we're driving this initiative with Village and with our Evernorth team to benefit our commercial space as well. So, we're pleased with the early traction, a lot of work to do, and it will continue to yield dividends both today and into the future. Thanks, Josh. Josh Raskin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Mr. Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Nathan Rich : Great. Good morning, and thanks for the questions. I wanted to go back to biosimilars. How has the pricing of biosimilar of Humira compared to expectations as more competition come to market? And given what appears to be a very significant reduction in pricing, does that pull forward the benefit from the Humira biosimilar at all? And for the different options that you added to the formulary, should we think of the economics of each of those as being similar to Evernorth? And then, just a quick follow-up on the Cigna Healthcare segment. Brian, could you maybe help us think through the seasonality this year and maybe why that's different than a typical year? And as we think about the 2024 and going forward, do you go back to more normal seasonality in that business? Thank you. Eric Palmer : Good morning, Nathan. It's Eric. I'll start. So, as you noted and implied in your question, biosimilars are a really important opportunity to drive competition and for us to then help to make that competition efficient to drive improvements to the affordability of these high-cost specialty medicines. Now, in 2023, we've continued to co-prefer Humira on the formulary. Towards the beginning of the year, we added Amjevita to our National Preferred Formulary and recently added Cyltezo and Sandoz's products, both the low and high [indiscernible] versions onto the NPF. So that's the activity that's gotten us to this point to date. I would note, we work through with the manufacturers on the terms of those to drive to the best available cost, the best available expense for our clients. And we have visibility into that pretty early on. So, we've navigated and made our arrangements in constructing the placement such as we came into this year. And so, I wouldn't want you to think about there being dynamics kind of playing out simultaneously. These are things we have negotiated in advance. We have visibility into as the products come into the market and we work to leverage the competition to continue to improve affordability for the benefit of the clients we serve. Over time, as we drive even more products, more competition, we'll work to continue to bring improved levels of affordability to our clients and continue to construct our offerings in a way that best meet their needs. I hand it over to Brian on the second part of your question. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Nathan. It's Brian. So, as it relates to the Cigna Healthcare seasonality, I'd start -- just to remind you, we expect the second half earnings to be a little bit less than 55% in the third quarter. Relative to the MCR component of that, our prior expectations on the MCR seasonality have not changed. So, what I mean by that is the directional pattern we saw, for example, in 2022 on MCR is a reasonable proxy for what we'd expect the 2023 quarterly pattern to be, and as a result, the fourth quarter MCR is likely to be the highest quarter of the year as we see more customers meet their deductible and out-of-pocket maximum obligations. However, we do expect the pace of SG&A spending to look different than it did last year. For example, we had a step up in SG&A in the fourth quarter of 2022 that we would not expect to recur in the fourth quarter of '23. The other item that I call your attention to is our net investment income in the fourth quarter of '22 was considerably weaker than what we're expecting to see in the fourth quarter of '23. So, those are the primary things to think through as it relates to the seasonality pattern. As it relates to '24. At this point in time, there's nothing I'd call your attention to that will lead us to think there's any abnormal pattern. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rich. Our next question comes from Mr. Steven Valiquette. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Steven Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning. So, I guess to the extent that your Medicare Advantage book is seeing a more normalized utilization trend this year that you baked into your pricing and guidance, just curious if you have any additional color just for the second quarter and whether it normalized more in the outpatient setting versus inpatient. I just want to hear a little more color on some of the trends by cost category, just given how topical this is for the industry this quarter. Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Steve. It's Brian. So, as you noted, we planned and priced for more normalized utilization levels in 2023, and our claims experience is largely consistent with that expectation. So, within the MA book specifically to the core of your question, we have seen elevated utilization of both outpatient and professional services all year. But important this should be viewed in the context of what we had forecasted and priced for. So, the overall cost trends are largely in line with our expectations in both our second half 2023 guidance and our 2024 bids. Anticipate that, that dynamic will continue, as it relates to specifically within outpatient and professional surgeries are the area that I'd call your attention to, in particular, orthopedic and cardiovascular, we did see some level of favorability in inpatients. So those are a few of the subcategories that I'd call your attention to, but all in line with what we had anticipated coming into the year. Steven Valiquette : Okay. That's perfect. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our next question comes from Mr. Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question. Stephen Baxter : Yeah, hi, thanks. I wanted to ask about some of the moving parts in the P&L this year for Evernorth. In the first half, there's a pretty notable divergence in the growth of revenue and gross profit. And then, what you've seen dropped through to earnings. I know that Centene is a big part of that and the investments you're making there. But the trend underneath that still feels like it's pretty notable. Any additional color on what's going on within Evernorth SG&A would be helpful. Whether that's investments or mix or anything else that we should be keeping in mind? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Hey, Steve, it's Brian. So, a few things I'd call your attention to in regards to the profitability margins relative to revenue. We had an expansion of our relationship with the Department of Defense that was effective on January 1, and we had some additional spending that we're kind of working our way into in terms of growing into that. So that certainly weighed down the income growth a bit in the first half of the year. To your point, the rate and pace of investments, particularly around the accelerated growth businesses in Evernorth, both the healthcare services as well as the Accredo specialty pharmacy also impacted the income growth. And then for the back half of the year, we expect accelerated income growth, again, mid-single digits in the third quarter, mid- to high-single digits in the fourth quarter, largely driven by the increased ramp for biosimilars. And I would note that, that's not predicated on any meaningful share shift. We have strong visibility to that income emerging in the back half of the year. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Baxter. Our next question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James. You may ask your question. John Ransom, your line is open. You may ask your question. Seems like he is not responding. We'll go ahead to Mr. George Hill with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. Your line is open. George Hill : Yeah. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I know it's a small piece of the business, but the other revenue inside of Evernorth grew 35% this quarter, accelerating actually versus the prior quarter. I guess it's becoming, to some degree, a meaningful portion of the segment. I guess, could you talk about what's driving that growth? And how should we think about the margin profile that's attached to that business? Brian Evanko : Good morning, George. It's Brian. I'll start and then Eric can pick up a bit. So yes, the fees and other revenue in Evernorth is a strong driver of growth, granted off of a low base. So, important to keep that in mind as you think about the overall P&L. Multiple areas of growth underneath this line. One I'd call out is we're seeing increased demand for PBM service-based solutions, meaning more fee-oriented relationships as we have more and more clients looking for those types of mechanisms. We also have contributions from our Evernorth Care businesses reflected here. So, for example, MDLive and eviCore are both contributing to that. And then if you're looking at pharmacy other revenue, the CuraScript Specialty Distribution business has been a strong grower year-on-year. You also recall from some of our prior conversations that we're very focused on driving cross-enterprise leverage between the Cigna Healthcare business and Evernorth. So, as Cigna Healthcare procures more and more services from Evernorth, we have some benefit that comes through the fees and the other revenue lines in Evernorth from that as well. So, Eric, anything you want to add in terms of further color? Eric Palmer : Brian, thanks. You've hit the headlines in terms of the main drivers here financially. Well, just to note, on the fee-based portion of the PBM in particular, this is an area that we've continued to accelerate. David made reference in his prepared remarks around our ClearCareRx program. This builds off of a couple of years of experience that we've got in providing fee-based fully-aligned mechanisms in terms of providing the pharmacy benefit, and so those fee types of arrangements will come through there. I would say, have you think about the margin profile for that business is very consistent with the other businesses in Express Scripts and the like. And then likewise, the growth in our MDLive and behavioral platforms continue to be an area of real focus for us and continued momentum into that driver as well. And I would have you think about those margins is also generally in line with the Evernorth segment overall. So, we continue to be excited about the opportunity and the momentum that we're building in all of the different lines across the Evernorth portfolio, and you're seeing the growth there come through that line. George Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Hill. Our last question comes from Mr. Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Lance Wilkes : Great. Thanks. A question on the specialty products in the Healthcare segment. And just had kind of three elements to it. One was, what sort of utilization trends you were seeing in behavioral, dental and some of the other areas where you're taking some risk? And then a broader question, just understanding, how much specialty is contributing to the earnings power of the business versus just the core medical? And what do you think the cross-sell opportunities might still remain for that business? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Lance. It's Brian. I'll start, and then David, if you want to chime in with anything, feel free. So, for a long period of time, as I think you know, our specialty products within Cigna Healthcare been a really core part of the value proposition as we seek to expand client relationships. So, we have few clients that only purchase medical services from us more and more purchase a full suite because we've demonstrated over time our clinical models perform best when we have a fuller suite of services. As it relates to what we're seeing in terms of trends in terms of utilization, behavioral health has certainly been growing at a strong clip, not just this year, but for the past few years. Part of that is by design as we engage with our customers. And over time, that's a good thing because the more utilization we see in behavioral health services, it helps to defray core medical costs over time. We've also seen an uptick in dental utilization this year as well, but all of these things are within, again, the boundaries of what we had forecasted and planned for and priced for within our Cigna Healthcare book of business, which is why you're seeing our commercial employer business continue to perform so well financially. And again, that line is on track to achieve target margins here in 2023. David, anything you want to pick up on here? David Cordani : Sure, Brian. Thanks. Good morning, Lance. A few items to highlight, specifically, just click down a little more notch, in behavioral, as Brian noted, elevated trend and as you would expect, and over a prolonged period of time, I think the last three to five years, as you click down in it, think about the professional services as such, we continue to innovate new products, new programs, expansion of network, both physical network, we operate the largest virtual behavioral network in America today, and then expanding behavioral services even further in our value-based care programs to help medical professionals be a first line of screening and support from that standpoint. To the last part of your question around the expansion opportunities within our portfolio, you know our portfolio well in terms of the healthcare side of the equation. If you think about the old monikers of Select, I think under 500 employees, middle market, 500 to 5,000 old monikers, and Nashville above 5,000, multi-geographic. Select, you still think about that as totally cross-sold and penetrated. We go to market with bundled solutions. It's a big part of our value proposition. Helps us generate a predictable high quality, low trend and outcome. Middle market remains and has a high level of penetration, yet there are cross-sell opportunities. And national accounts, a lower level of penetration versus the other segments. However, as I noted to A.J.'s question, the point solution fatigue in the marketplace presents it even further opportunity as you coordinate those services. The last note I would make is as we leverage the breadth of the Evernorth capabilities today and into the future, we're innovating new solutions. So, you'll hear us talk more about [path wall] (ph) programs to take specific diagnoses and look at reengineering those episodes of care end-to-end. And in cases to your phraseology, we take risk based on the performance, we hold ourself accountable based upon the clinical service and financial outcomes. So, strong penetration down market, opportunities upmarket, market buying behavior is evolving because of point solution fatigue, and importantly, continued innovation will continue to drive growth for us there. Thanks, Lance. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Wilkes. I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : Thank you for your engagement and questions today. I just want to highlight a few items. We stepped into 2023 with strong growth and have been successful in building beyond that momentum throughout the first half of the year. We remain confident that we'll deliver on our commitments, including our adjusted EPS outlook for 2023 of at least $24.70 and our commitment for at least $28.00 of EPS in 2024. I'd also know how proud and appreciative I am of our colleagues around the world who continue to be dedicated to driving innovation and delivering on the programs and solutions, as well as partnerships that support every day the health and vitality of our customers, our patients and our clients. As always, we look forward to talking to you again soon about how we're working to sustain the growth of our company and capture more opportunities to serve more lives and achieve a greater impact, and we continue to invest in our future every day to drive further innovation. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna Group's second quarter 2023 results review.

We'll begin by turning the conference over to Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, the Cigna Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Evanko, Chief Financial Officer; and Eric Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evernorth Health Services. . In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including our third quarter financial results and our updated financial outlook for 2023. Following their prepared remarks, David, Brian and Eric will be available for Q&A.  As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures, including adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP.  A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of the cignagroup.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance.  In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2023 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.  Before turning over the call, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results. In the third quarter, we recorded an after-tax special item charge of $171 million or $0.58 per share for charges primarily associated with our Medicare litigation settlement.  We also recorded an after-tax special item charge of $19 million or $0.06 per share associated with the sale of our international life accidental and supplemental business to Chubb and an after-tax special item charge of $9 million or $0.03 per share for integration and transaction-related costs.  As described in today's release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2023 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2023 dividends.  With that, I'll turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We had another quarter of strong performance, and we remain on pace for a year of sustained momentum in 2023.  With the strength of capabilities across our health services and benefits platforms, we are continuing to deliver on our mission for those we serve as we continue to grow our company.  Today, I'll highlight key drivers supporting our performance during the quarter our priorities and opportunities for expanding our impact and continue to advance our growth and our view of 2024, including some of the expected tailwinds and headwinds. Brian will share additional perspective about our third quarter performance as well as our outlook for the rest of the year. So with that, let's get started.  In the third quarter, we delivered $49 billion in total revenue, adjusted earnings per share of $6.77, continued strong cash flow generation across our franchise, all while continuing to reinvest back in our business to fund growth, expansion and ongoing innovation. These results are strong, and they show how we're continuing our track record of strong, sustained performance.  With our Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare Benefits platform, we are executing well in a dynamic period and fueling customer growth with our deep clinical expertise, innovative solutions and breadth of market-leading capabilities. Our results during the quarter demonstrate how we're continuing to deliver on our commitments for our customers and patients our clients as well as our shareholders. We are raising our full year 2023 outlook for EPS, customer and revenue growth, as well as cash flow from operations.  With our continued affordability initiatives, we are also now guiding to an improved medical care ratio for 2023. Our businesses are performing well, and we now expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share of at least $24.75 for full year 2023.  Now I'll turn to how we are working to sustain our growth and impact. With our durable strategic growth framework, we harness complementary capabilities from across the Cigna Group. We have scale to mature businesses that drive foundational growth, and businesses in faster-growing market segments that contribute accelerated growth.  We fuel additional growth through cross enterprise leverage as we bring together the power of our talent, client relationships, differentiated capabilities and innovation from across our company.  Next, I'll share how we have deliberately shaped our portfolio of businesses that are well positioned for today's market needs. Additionally, I'll highlight some of the ways we continue to drive our sustained success as we look to the future. Evernorth Health Services continues to demonstrate a proven ability to create value with differentiated pharmacy care and benefits capabilities. We had a strong pharmacy benefit selling season for 2024, and our teams are already actively engaged in the 2025 season. We are continuing to innovate and provide our clients with expanded choice as well as market-leading value.  Many of the clients we serve leverage Evernorth's unique suite of solutions to support the needs of their customers. Centene is one new relationship we discussed before, and our teams have been collaborating effectively on implementation work, which is going very well as we prepare to serve approximately 20 million Centene customers beginning in January. We have a leadership position in addressing a substantial market opportunity with the expanded wave of pharmacological innovation that is reshaping the health care landscape. Many of the treatments that are coming to market are pressuring affordability with high list prices from drug manufacturers.  At Evernorth, we are driving better experience, clinical outcome and affordability for patients and clients, given our deep clinical expertise, strong relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as with physicians.  The surge of demand for the GLP-1 drug class for weight management offers a good example of how we provide value. Our InCircle Rx program is an innovative solution that addresses the complexity and costs associated with obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, a prevalent combination of conditions that's also known as cardio diabesity. Growing at Evernorth's clinical expertise, breadth and depth of data and analytical insights, InCircle Rx guides patients to the most effective care and helps improve affordability for clients.  Beyond the GLP-1 drug class, we expect to see many different manufacturers bringing forth a growing number of new drugs, including gene therapies, additional treatments for cancer as well as others for Alzheimer's and other conditions.  We are uniquely well positioned to make medicine more accessible, affordable and clinically coordinated for those we serve as well as to continue to drive growth for our company.  Now in our international health business, another foundational business within a portfolio. We are supporting continued growth in target markets and expanding our portfolio of solutions. During the quarter, for example, we introduced a new affordable health plan, customized specifically for the globally mobile seniors population.  Additionally, in the foundational portfolio, our U.S. commercial business continues to harness cross-enterprise leverage capabilities for the benefit of their clients.  As we look forward to 2024, we know that additional -- in addition to affordability, one of the top priorities for many employers is expanding access, coordination and overall effectiveness of behavioral health programs and solutions.  The benefit of our commercial clients to customers, we are leveraging innovations and capabilities that exist in our accelerated businesses. For example, stress, anxiety, [indiscernible], other mental health conditions create challenges for employers who need a healthy, engaged workforce, and we continue to expand the behavioral health solutions we offer through Evernorth Care businesses.  One of the newer solutions is Confide behavioral health navigator. It's resonating well with clients, helping us both retain and win new business. Confide is guided by a proven model of a more proactive, high-touch service level, effective monitoring and targeted follow-up engagement.  We will launch additional enhancements next year to provide digital tools that are personalized to the needs of individual patients that improve matching them with the right therapists and also offer greater convenience and accelerated scheduling opportunities. Additionally, as we continue to advance our focus on vitality, including our latest research addressing the capacity of individuals across multiple dimensions, it reinforces that mental health, for example, is one of the most significant drivers. We know that adults without significant mental health challenges are 10x more likely to have high vitality. Now if you're an employer, this means higher engagement, higher productivity, lower turnover as well as lower medical costs.  In addition to addressing growing behavior health needs in Evernorth Care, we are also acting as a positive disruptor in care delivery and care management to improve experience, outcomes and access from a patient's perspective. We're developing innovative care models and clinical programs with continued investments, for example, to expand our digital and virtually-led capabilities, while making sure they are coordinated and connected with physical sites of care. For example, we continue to innovate and build on leading virtual care platform and plan to further accelerate new capabilities in 2024.  Turning to another accelerated growth business. I'll touch on specialty pharmacy. Last quarter, we talked with you about Accredo's extensive clinical expertise in the assets that provide us with a competitive advantage in this fast-growing specialty pharmacy market, which continues to be an important source of growth for our company.  We also have additional capabilities contributing to our leadership and growth opportunities in this space. Accredo focuses predominantly on supporting patients who receive specialty drugs in their home. Sometimes, these complex medications also need to be administered in physician's offices or hospital outpatient settings.  Today, we support providers and health systems with our CuraScript specialty distribution capability and we continue to see meaningful growth in this aspect of our specialty pharmacy services.  Finally, an additional accelerated business is our U.S. government portfolio services. We are pleased with our recent Medicare stars quality rating showing that we again have over 2/3 of our members in 4-star or higher plans. This is recognition of the value we provide to seniors in supporting access as well as high-quality care.  With open enrollment now underway for both Medicare Advantage and the individual exchange business, we are balancing competitive benefit offerings, targeted market expansion and pricing discipline activity.  So to summarize, we are performing well across our diverse enterprise. And these highlights reinforce how our strategic framework guides us in accelerating innovation, expanding client relationships and continuing to broaden our reach. Now as we look to 2024, we expect another strong year of performance for the Cigna Group as we build on momentum with EPS, revenue and cash flow growth. We'll share more detailed guidance with you on our fourth quarter earnings call as we always do.  The tailwinds and headwinds we expect in the year ahead remain largely consistent with our prior conversation, and we continue to be confident in our ability to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $28 per share in 2024.  Notable tailwinds include growth-related contributions, including the full launch of Centene, which starts on January 1, a growing positive impact of biosimilar contributions, and an improved margin profile in our individual exchange business.  In terms of headwinds, we will continue to make strategic investments across our portfolio of businesses to drive sustained innovation as well as position ourselves for long-term growth. Now I'll just briefly summarize our performance for the quarter. We had another strong quarter, and it builds on good momentum throughout the course of the year. We delivered adjusted EPS of $6.77, as well as strong customer, revenue and cash flow growth.  Our company continues to deliver for the benefit of those we serve, and we have been able to increase our outlook for adjusted EPS to at least $24.75 for full year 2023, and we expect to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $28 in 2024, which is consistent with our past discussions.  We are well positioned with a clear durable strategic framework that leverages the power of our differentiated services within our benefits portfolio and services portfolio. And now Brian will share additional perspective about our performance in the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Brian? Brian Evanko : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review the Cigna Group's third quarter 2023 results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year.  We are proud to deliver another strong quarterly performance, including all of our most critical metrics running in line or favorable to expectations. With this performance, we are increasing our full year adjusted 2023 earnings outlook to at least $24.75 per share.  Now looking at the quarter specifically, some key consolidated financial highlights include revenue growth of 8% to $49 billion, after-tax adjusted earnings growth of 8% to $2 billion, adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% to $6.77, and cash flow from operations of $2.8 billion.  Our 2 growth platforms continue to perform well, with Evernorth posting a bottom line growth rate that improved sequentially as expected, and Cigna Healthcare delivering results ahead of expectations.  Regarding our growth platforms, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Evernorth continues to deliver strong results, with third quarter 2023 revenues growing 8% to $38.6 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings growing 6% to $1.7 billion in line with expectations. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by strong performance in our Specialty Pharmacy business, which continues to see double-digit year-over-year revenue growth.  We continue to provide a variety of differentiated services and solutions that drive affordability and value for our customers and our clients, while also enhancing cross enterprise leverage across our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare growth platforms.  In addition, we continue to make strategic investments to support onboarding of new clients and expansion of existing client relationships, all while advancing our digital and care solutions capabilities to enhance customer experiences and provide clients with greater options to achieve their critical goals of access, quality outcomes and affordability.  Overall, Evernorth delivered strong third quarter results, consistent with expectations, and we remain well positioned as we look to the remainder of the year.  Turning to Cigna Healthcare. Third quarter 2023 adjusted revenues grew 14% to $12.8 billion. Pretax adjusted earnings grew 16% to $1.2 billion, and the medical care ratio was 80.5%. Our medical care ratio was better than expectations, driven by our U.S. commercial business. More specifically, our favorable MCR performance was a reflection of ongoing disciplined pricing and continued affordability initiatives, ensuring patients get quality care in appropriate settings. An example of this is Pathwell Specialty, our site of care program that aligns patients who have high-cost specialty conditions with high quality, yet cost-effective care settings.  Moving to Cigna Healthcare Medical customers. We ended the quarter with 19.6 million total medical customers, which represents growth of approximately 1.6 million customers year-to-date. On a sequential basis, we delivered medical customer growth across all businesses within Cigna Healthcare, ahead of expectations.  Overall, Cigna Healthcare continues to provide differentiated value and drive affordability for our customers and clients, and the results in the quarter demonstrate our strong underlying fundamentals. Now turning to our outlook for full year 2023. We have increased our expectations for full year 2023 consolidated adjusted revenues to at least $192 billion, driven by strong growth across our businesses. And we are increasing our full year 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to at least $24.75 per share.  In Evernorth, we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $6.4 billion. This implies mid- to high single-digit growth in the fourth quarter, consistent with our prior commentary. In Cigna Healthcare, we are raising our medical customer growth expectation to at least 1.6 million customers. This updated outlook represents the third consecutive quarter we have increased our customer growth despite the dynamic economic backdrop. We now expect our medical care ratio to be within a range of 81.5% to 82%, an improvement of 30 basis points from the high end of the prior range. And we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $4.425 billion. This outlook reflects our continued focus and execution across our Cigna Healthcare businesses. Additionally, our full year 2023 enterprise adjusted SG&A ratio is now expected to be approximately 7.4%, an increase compared to our prior guidance as we further accelerate investments across both our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms.  And finally, our full year 2023 adjusted tax rate is now expected to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%.  Turning to our 2023 capital management position and outlook. Year-to-date through November 1, 2023, we have repurchased approximately 7.7 million shares of our common stock for approximately $2.2 billion. The continued strength of our cash generation gives us the confidence to increase our full year 2023 expected cash flow from operations by $1 billion to at least $10.5 billion for full year 2023. And our updated guidance assumes full year 2023 weighted average shares outstanding to now be in the range of 296 million to 298 million shares.  Our healthy balance sheet and cash flow outlook benefit from our efficient service-based model that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital.  Now to recap. Third quarter results were strong, reflecting execution across our diverse portfolio of businesses, giving us confidence to deliver on our increased 2023 adjusted EPS guidance of at least $24.75. While we will provide formal 2024 guidance on our fourth quarter call, we continue to expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $28. That said, I'd like to expand upon the tailwinds and headwinds David spoke to earlier. Our tailwinds include revenue growth, inclusive of the full launch of our Centene relationship starting January 1, and continued momentum of the biosimilar opportunity to drive more savings to benefit our patients and clients.  We also anticipate improvement in our individual exchange margins next year driven by our pricing actions taken in targeted geographies. Given these actions, we are likely to have fewer customers in the individual exchange business relative to where we are in 2023.  These tailwinds will be partially offset by continued strategic investments across our portfolio of businesses to drive sustained innovation and long-term growth. We look forward to providing detailed guidance on our fourth quarter call. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : I just really wanted to focus on a couple of things. One would be potential PBM legislation as we think about potentially an end of year bill.  What are your thoughts on what could be included on the PBM side?  And then secondly, David, you talked about InCircle Rx and talked about GLP-1. I think this is a real benefit, especially when I think about your PBM business for the self-insured market.  Can you maybe just talk about the opportunities that you see there? And how you see that going forward? Are we seeing more people sign up for this in '24, et cetera? David Cordani : It's David. I'll take the legislative question, a little tee up relative to the GLP-1 question in the broader marketplace, and I'll ask Eric to expand on the InCircle Rx program. Specific to legislation, as you know, we haven't continued to expect to operate in a very active regulatory and legislative environment. As a result, we remain active and constructively engaged in the ongoing dialogue. And by way of framing, before I get the specific, potential legislative activities, we positioned our company with a breadth of capabilities, both modular configured and otherwise, and value creation and value capture capabilities that we believe will be able to thrive and grow under a variety of environments.  I'd highlight an area where we have a lot of passion, and that is to ensure that and amplify the fact that any legislative regulatory activity should not remove choice, especially from the commercial market for employers as well as health plans given that they are large sophisticated organizations and fund the vast majority of the comprehensive benefit costs.  Having said that, there is intensified activity around transparency, and we are highly supportive of transparency so long it is targeted and constructive, meaning it could drive requisite level of actions on a go-forward basis. As it relates to the innovation that's taking place, as I noted in my prepared remarks, we believe we are exceptionally well positioned. We took very deliberate actions 5 years ago by acquiring Express Scripts, 3 years ago by launching Evernorth, our continued ongoing investment in our specialty capabilities, et cetera, are all oriented around positioning toward both today's class of drugs that we're seeing like the GLP-1s, but future innovations, be they for Alzheimer's, additional cancer therapies, gene therapies, et cetera. And we believe we're well positioned to support both commercial clients as well as health plans.  InCircle Rx is a wonderful new innovation. It's the first of its kind in the marketplace and highly supportive of clients. Eric, can I ask you to expand on that? Eric Palmer : Sure, David. Lisa, It's Eric. As you can imagine, there is significant interest and need from our clients on the InCircle Rx program and helping them with GLP-1s more broadly. They're looking for our help with managing the affordability and ensuring that they get good outcomes from the spending on these treatments.  As David teed up, I'm really excited about, and I think the InCircle Rx program is a great example of the power of the collective capabilities that we have within Evernorth. It's the first of its kind, comprehensive solution that brings together our supply chain and procurement expertise, along with our clinical capabilities to target the right patient population, the relevant clinical markers, it targets the pharmacy network management, working to eliminate any waste or use in the system, and it works to engage patients with additional support that they need to help make changes that makes the impact last year. And we wrap this all with a guarantee of clinical outcomes and such for our clients as well.  So we're -- in short, we're really optimistic and excited about the opportunity for this product brings to self-funded markets and would expect additional growth as we look into 2024 and beyond. Operator : And this question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : I wanted to focus on the individual market for a second. Membership was up pretty significantly there, almost 100,000 members. Curious if that's what's driving your 200,000 member guidance increase? You're expecting another big slug of those members in the fourth quarter. . And then can you remind us where you are on margins relative to target this year, and where you kind of -- you talked about improving that? Do you expect to get into target margins next year? That would be helpful. Brian Evanko : Justin, it's Brian. Just to clarify, your second question was specifically on the individual exchanges, correct, in terms of the margin profile? Justin Lake : Exactly. Brian Evanko : Yes. Yes. So first off, as it relates to the Cigna Healthcare customer guide increasing by 200,000 customers, I'd start by saying we're really pleased with the strong momentum across the health care book with our year-to-date customers running ahead of expectations. And that builds off a really strong year we had in 2022, where we added nearly 1 million customers in the Cigna Healthcare business, primarily in our U.S. commercial business.  To your point, we have continued to show sequential growth in our U.S. government businesses in the third quarter, particularly individual exchanges. But we've also seen favorability in our U.S. commercial membership, as we have not seen the disenrollment levels we had incorporated into our prior outlook. You may recall that we had been anticipating some economic weakness late in 2023, but this has not yet materialized in any notable impact on our customer volumes. So all in, we're really pleased with 9% projected full year customer growth in Cigna Healthcare, a portion of which is related to the individual exchanges, but a portion of which is related to the strength in our U.S. commercial business.  As it relates to the individual exchange margin profile, just for a little bit of context, you can think of this as being approximately a $5 billion block of business for us in 2023. And as we shared in our second quarter call, we anticipate the individual exchange book to run below our target margins in 2023, and our long-term target for this business is 4% to 6%. A primary driver of this is the increased risk adjustment payable that we expect to owe, with the majority of that impact driven by our 2 largest states, notably Texas and Georgia.  Now for 2024, we've taken sizable price increases in both of these 2 large states, and we would expect some degree of margin expansion in the individual book overall. The exact amount of the margin improvement will be a function of our geographic mix and our duration mix in 2024, and we're likely to have fewer customers in the individual exchange products in 2024 compared to where we are in 2023. But hopefully, that helps a bit, as you think about how to model the '24 Cigna Healthcare outlook. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. In the tailwind side of things. You talked about revenue growth, including the Centene launch. You've talked so far about the exchanges as well as kind of other kind of one-time items.  Does that mean that we should generally think about the rest of the businesses growing more or less in line with those long-term growth targets? Or is there any other business where you would highlight a specific headwind or tailwind to the revenue growth outlook for next year? David Cordani : Kevin, it's David. I'd ask you to step back and first look at the consistency of our performance over the years relative to the portfolio. And if you look at the -- our EPS CAGR, even over the past several years, with a slight downtick this year because of the investments we've made to onboard Centene and our outlook for 2024, we remain consistently within our growth algorithm of 10% to 13% on average EPS CAGR as we've delivered that over the last 3 years, 5 years and 10-year time horizon.  We called out a few of the headwinds and tailwinds to try to amplify some of the components. I would suggest that the first component, the outsized growth, and specifically the Centene contribution, given the offset in 2023, you can view that one as more directionally additive. That pushes us to the high end of the range from an EPS growth standpoint versus the low end of the range. The other items that we've talked about are largely contemplated in the core parts of our business and the core parts of our operations on a go-forward basis. And as Brian and I both noted, we'll give you more detailed guidance on our fourth quarter call, as we typically do. Operator : Our next question comes from AJ Rice with UBS. A.J. Rice: Just to maybe continue to focus on some of those potential tailwinds for next year. I think the investment to get that large Centene contract up and running for this year was about $0.50 drag roughly $200 million pretax.  When you think about that for next year, should we just assume that, that drag goes away? I know PBM contracts typically ramp up over time. Or is there some potential level of profit contribution, so the swing is greater than $0.50?  And then on the biosimilar comment. I know this year, in the second half, you'd included some benefit from the HUMIRA conversion or having some biosimilar competition. Should we think of -- what you're thinking about as a tailwind of just annualizing that? Or are there other opportunities that go beyond just annualizing the second half benefit from that HUMIRA conversion? David Cordani : AJ, it's David. You've packed a lot in there. I'm going to ask Brian to start by framing the economics year-over-year on the Centene relationship, our investment, the year-over-year performance, et cetera.  Asking to transition that over to Eric, he could talk about how the relationship is going importantly. And I'll ask Eric to amplify a little bit relative to the biosimilar impact we're seeing in the latter part of this year and into next year. Brian? Brian Evanko : As it relates to the Centene economics, your math is broadly right. We continue to expect to spend about $200 million this year in the process of preparing for the onboarding.  We expect next year to be approximately breakeven or slightly positive. So that's the way to think about the modeling of that, '25, we continue to expect, it will be at run rate profitability.  As it relates to the biosimilars component, for '24, we expect it to largely be a HUMIRA driven biosimilar story. So that the '25, and thereafter biosimilars will be further accretive to Evernorth in time, but '24 is really going to be primarily driven by the annualization of the HUMIRA related biosimilar benefit. Eric, do you want to pick up? Eric Palmer : Sure. we've said from the beginning that the adoption of biosimilars is going to be more extended and slower process. And the experience to date has been consistent with our expectations. We've driven meaningful savings for the benefit of our customers and clients so far this year, and we continue to see this opportunity ramp throughout the course of next year, and as part of the market ongoing.  We've talked in other settings about the meaningful opportunity for biosimilars, not only for [indiscernible] but for other conditions, and expect there to be more competition over time where up to 25% or 30% of the spend in the specialty market, we'll have competition, compared to something like less than 10% today. So in short, this is an area that we're well positioned to drive meaningful value for the benefit of our customers and clients that we have seen unfolding consistent with our expectations. And we're positioned to lead through over the course of the coming years. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Stephen Baxter : I was hoping you could expand a little bit on the MLR outperformance in the quarter. I guess, could you talk a bit more about what you saw on utilization? I guess, how did the seasonal patterns and the third quarter compared to a more normal pre-COVID environment?  And then, it looks like you assumed a decent step-up in Q4, pretty consistent with what you've seen in the past couple of years. Can you talk a little bit about the assumptions there on utilization? Brian Evanko : It's Brian. So I'll start again, just reiterating how pleased we are to have delivered another strong quarter of MCR performance in Cigna Healthcare, which was favorable to expectations and drove really the income outperformance that we saw in the Cigna Healthcare segment.  Just as a reminder, if you rewind the clock a bit here, we planned in price for more normalized utilization levels coming into 2023. And our claims experience is largely consistent with that expectation.  Now within the quarter specifically, our government product lines, you can think of the Medicare lines and individual exchange lines ran largely in line with expectations, while our U.S. commercial business drove the favorability in the medical care ratio.  As it relates to the full year MCR outlook, we have improved the expectation by 15 basis points at the midpoint, reflecting the favorable third quarter experience, but no significant change in our fourth quarter MCR outlook compared to our prior expectations. So that's the way I'd encourage you to think about the 3Q versus 4Q dynamics.  As it relates to specific utilization patterns and categories and such, I actually wouldn't call out any specific categories in terms of driving outsized favorability. We did see some modest amount of inpatient favorability in the third quarter, particularly on higher unit cost procedures, which did contribute to that MCR outperformance. But I'd also note that our site of care strategies continue to produce really strong results. A tangible example we often talk about is shifting inpatient procedures to outpatient, for example, on orthopedics. But the site of care strategies have advanced in many other areas as well. For example, Pathwell Specialty, which I talked about earlier, program we introduced that optimizes CytoCare for high-cost infusions of specialty drugs. Historically, these have been administered in the hospital outpatient setting. However, certain patients can experience equal or better clinical quality at a lower cost by having the infusion in their home.  So that's just an example of something that has continued to build over time and contributed to the favorable MCR performance we saw in the quarter.  So just to summarize, we're pleased with the performance, U.S. commercial drove the majority of the favorability in the third quarter. And as noted, the fourth quarter MCL is very consistent with our prior expectations. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Joshua Raskin : I didn't hear in the prepared remarks anything about commercial, large group membership to start the year. So I'm curious on that. But my real question is, if you could compare and contrast the traction you're getting around VillageMD in the commercial markets versus the Medicare markets, I'd be specifically interested in the appetite from large employers. And if there's any sort of pull for demand? Or are you getting more traction when you're presenting what those arrangements can look like? David Cordani : Josh, it's David. Let me speak to the commercial large market, and then frame your specific question relative to early traction with Village. And then I'm going to ask Eric to just describe a little bit more broadly the evolving relationship and the strategic work we continue to advance with Village.  First, specific to the commercial marketplace and the selling season. You did miss it, we didn't profile the 2024 outlook in any level of detail.  Stepping back, as Brian noted in his prior comment, we're really pleased with the 2023 results, now increasing the outlook for our overall lives for our Cigna Healthcare care portfolio, yet again, in excess of 1 million half lives, and coming off of a 2022 number, approaching 1 million lives. For 2024, I give you some directional indicators at this point in time. First, big picture for the enterprise. We expect it to be another attractive year of growth for the Cigna Group in aggregate, specific to the commercial marketplace, we expect within the commercial marketplace portfolio, our results continue to be led by our sustained strong performance. The combination of our select segment and our middle market segment where our value proposition and our products and services are resonating quite well. Strong retention and good new business adds within that portfolio. And then specific to National Accounts. Currently, our outlook for 2024 is on the benefit side of the equation, after some outsized growth in 2023, 2024 will look a little bit more normalized relative to prior years. And to remind you, strategically for that segment, we've expected to see that segment be a flat to slightly shrinking segment in the market in aggregate within the employer landscape. Our strategy has us maintaining share and deepening our relationship with our clients through our further expanding portfolio of specialty services.  So to put a circle around it, it will be another strong year of growth for the Cigna Group in aggregate, and the commercial portfolio in 2024 will be led by the sustained strength of the select and the middle market business. Specific to Villages, a quick tee up to your comment. Our commercial employers today already are seeing a step function to benefit from our relationship with Village and then the Village Summit acquisition in the nature in which we've structured that relationship. So we were able to deliver a step function of value to our commercial clients already, be they self-funded, be they shared returns, be they guarantee cost from that standpoint.  And then the team is aggressively at work to further enhance the value proposition there.  And Eric, I'll just ask you to provide a little color in terms of the way in which the teams are working together to advance the value-based care traction. Eric Palmer : Sure. Stepping back a bit for Village, have you think about both the financial and the strategic component of our relationship with Village, as you know, we got a minority stake of ownership now. And so that's performing consistent with our expectations.  From a strategic perspective, think of our work with Village is one Village and us being committed partners to work together. We're working to build an alignment of an ecosystem of high-performing providers where we can ramp Village and Summit's operations with some of our clinical assets, raft and support with the data and insights from both organizations to help to ensure patients can get to the best care they need, the best specialists they need, the highest quality, et cetera. And I really think of that as ultimately applicable across commercial or government plans. Our focus in the near term has been, I'll say, more skewed towards the commercial market, but it's an approach that works across any payer here, right, because it focuses on getting to the highest quality, best care available for an individual. And that transcends across all the markets.  Over time, we'll work to continue to expand this. But to date, off to a good start and pleased with the progress and the momentum that we're building with our partnership with Village. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Scott Fidel : I was hoping maybe we could just toggle over to MA for a second, and maybe just give us sort of a framing of uppers on how sort of MLR was performing, and pretax margin sort of baseline versus the long-term government 3% to 5% target for '23?  And then, if you want to give us some initial observations on how the AEP seems to be developing for you, and how you feel about MA growth next year versus, let's call it, the industry forecast around 7% growth. David Cordani : Scott, it's David. Just a couple of comments, and I'll ask Brian to peel back a couple of your specific points.  First, as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're pleased with the Stars position, the stable, strong Stars position we have, and continued traction of our ongoing focus to expand our geographic footprint. And then I'll ask Brian to expand on a little bit more significantly, as well as our ongoing investments in terms of our broad set of capabilities.  2023 was a very good year of growth for us in terms of this business portfolio, and our market expansion plans are on track for 2024. Brian, could I ask you to expand on that a little bit? Brian Evanko : Sure, David. Scott, maybe I'll take your questions in a little bit of a reverse order, and start with AEP and the growth expectations, then I'll get to the margin profile.  As David just referenced, we're really pleased with the growth in the MA book year-to-date. Customers are up 13% year-to-date 2023. And since 2019, as you know, we've gradually expanded our geographic footprint in this business, from covering just 20% of Medicare Advantage eligibles in 2019 to over 40% today. And for 2024, we have some further expansion transpiring, and we'll now have offerings in about 45% of the addressable market.  As we approach the 2024 bid cycle, we employed a micro market posture as we always do, and this resulted in stable benefits in most geographies and a few areas where we had targeted pullbacks and benefits in light of the funding environment.  Now it's really early in the AEP, as you can appreciate, and there's still several weeks to go. But taken all together, based on what we know today, we would expect to see net customer growth again in 2024.  As it relates to the margin profile, as we expected, our 2023 margins continue to be below our long-term target margin range, which is 4% to 5% on this book of business. You can think of this as primarily driven by administrative expenses as we have outsized investment spend and geographic expansion, product expansion and new capabilities.  So you should think of the MA margins as representing a source of future embedded earnings power that will contribute toward our long-term growth in Cigna Healthcare segment income over a multiyear basis.  For 2024, we expect to continue running below our long-term target margin range in this business. The final projected margin here will also be a function of geographic mix, product mix and customer duration mix, depending on how that shakes out in the AEP and across the balance of the year.  So we'll certainly be prepared to give you more detailed guidance during the fourth quarter call, but hopefully, that helps turn out. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with Cowen. Gary Taylor : I just wanted to go back and ask one more question about the exchange business and expectations for next year.  When we look at the pricing actions you guys took about across markets, it looks very, very outsized versus what the rest of the industry did. So I think that's it's a huge positive in terms of the margin expectation.  But historically, companies that have done that have seen really significant deterioration of enrollment.  So I guess the question is, how much of the at least $28 in 2024 is dependent upon exchange earnings? If we saw the enrollment decline by 30%, 40%, something like that, yet the margin was better, is that impactful to getting to the 24% guidance? Like how much should we care about where we see the enrollment numbers come in? Brian Evanko : Gary, it's Brian. So certainly, your point is well taken in terms of large price increases can have impacts on the customer volumes in disproportionate ways. We have to see how this cycle plays out in terms of the elasticity of the customer growth relative to those pricing actions. To David's comments earlier on our tailwinds, this is one of several tailwinds that we have. So I would encourage you not to over-index on the customer volumes in terms of our ability to deliver against the $28 of earnings per share.  Just if you think about the context of this, it's a $5 billion block of business. Target margins, that's $250 million of profit. The midpoint of the 4% to 6% range. So if you think about the delta there, relative to the year-over-year, we're talking about $100 millions of income growth at the enterprise level.  So I just -- I would encourage you not to overindex on this one specific factor. But we're confident we're going to see the margin expansion. We're confident we'll see the income tailwind, and we'll give you more updated guidance on the fourth quarter call. Operator : Our next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich : I wanted to follow up on the comments around GLP-1 through obesity, and the potential value of Evernorth can deliver for clients there.  I guess, could you go into a little bit more detail on the nature of discussions you're having with the drug manufacturers right now on pricing and getting that to a level that could expand access?  And what role, maybe, the outcomes trials will play in those discussions in terms of potentially -- from your kind of commercial customers, their desire to expand access to these therapies for their populations? David Cordani : It's David. Just a little framing. And consistent with prior conversations we've had. To date, within our benefits portfolio, you could think about 10% to 20% of our clients currently having adopted an optional buy-up or coverage for weight management outside of the already formulary positioning for diabetes for the drug class, number one. On the Evernorth side of the equation, as we've discussed before, the percentage is higher, and you can think about why the difference. The difference is within the Evernorth portfolio, the commercial employer landscape is larger employer size on average versus the diversity that exists on the Cigna Healthcare care side. And then within the health plan portfolio, enabling some aspect of it from an access. So that gives you little stage setting of the fluidity of the current environment.  Your question comes down to a fair amount of detail relative to pricing and working with the manufacturers. I'll ask Eric to talk just more broadly, this is an area where, as we discussed in our prepared remarks, where the broad capabilities of our Evernorth portfolio significantly thrive in terms of data clinical aspects, clinical coordination, relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers and importantly, relationship with practicing physicians to get the best coordinated care.  So Eric, could I ask you to expand on that a little bit? Eric Palmer : Great. So with respect to this, Stepping back, I would have you think about the impact here that will need to unfold, will be around improving affordability. As has been said and reported across a variety of different channels, these therapies are effective, but they're also very expensive. We would expect that over time, we'll be well positioned to harness the power of competition to improve the affordability to bring the cost down. That's an important element.  But then in addition to that, we're positioned to wrap and support these patients with additional services, clinical services, the right approach, the right targeting to ensure the maximum effectiveness here.  So I don't know that it's constructive to talk about any of the kind of ongoing dialogue with manufacturers. But rest assured, that we are very engaged with the variety of pharma manufacturers in this space, looking at ways to expand access and improve affordability, just like Express Scripts is a long history of doing, as new innovations have come to the market and the pharmacy space, and we'll continue to be a leader there. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. David Windley : Mostly a clarification. On the government utilization, maybe particularly Medicare Advantage, it sounds like it was in line with your expectations. But I wondered if you could comment if you are seeing elevated -- in the elevated outpatient that gets called out by others in the space, and that was just, again, in line with your expectations.  And then in terms of managing utilization inside of service. You mentioned good success in managing side of service and Pathwell. Is Pathwell the primary vehicle by which you're doing that? And what is the kind of customer adoption or the penetration, I guess, of Pathwell in your side of surface utilization management? Brian Evanko : Dave, it's Brian. So on your first question on the MA utilization patterns, as I mentioned earlier, when we stepped into 2023, we expected more normalized utilization levels across all of our different product lines, and the claims experience is broadly in line with that.  And within the MA book specifically, throughout the entire year, we've seen elevated utilization in both outpatient and professional services in particular. But again, within the context of what we had forecasted and planned for. So the third quarter, our government lines ran broadly in line with where we expected them to. And as I said earlier, our U.S. commercial business really drove the favorability.  So again, the MA patterns were broadly a continuation of what we saw in the first half of the year, and our 2023 guidance and 2024 bids anticipate that these dynamics will continue as opposed to assuming any meaningful amount of cost abatement occurs.  On your second question on site of service, I did call out the Pathwell specialty example. But you should think of that as one of the many arrows that we have in the quiver, if you will. So the work we've been doing over the past several years has largely been moving inpatient to outpatient. We've been moving things from emergency rooms to urgent care, moving things from physician offices to virtual.  So Pathwell Specialty is another example of the evolution of our CytoCare program. So I wouldn't view that as the silver bullet here by any means, but it's an incremental contributor to the strategy we had in place for several years now. Operator : Our last question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Lance Wilkes : Yes. Just wanted to turn to the PBM within Evernorth. And kind of 2 elements to the question. One was, if you could just talk a little about the strategic role of Part D, both for the PBM and for health care for driving kind of MA business going forward? And how you see that going forward, given some of the changes in the Part D program.  And then the specific question was on adjusted home delivery and specialty scripts. There were some drops in that. I was just interested if that was a driver -- that was driven by the prime relationship and any sort of in-sourcing that's going on there? Or what the other drivers of that move was? David Cordani : Lance, it's David. I'll take the first part of your question. I'll ask Brian to address the second part of your question. . First, specific to Part D broadly, with the size, shape and scope of our enterprise today, it's a portion of our enterprise, but I would call it as not a significant part of our overall portfolio. That's not to dismiss the importance of it from a societal standpoint, by any stretch of imagination. But when you look at the scope of our enterprise approaching $200 billion of revenue this year, I would not call it as a significant component.  Secondly, inferred in your question, I would submit that we've underrealized or underleveraged the potential to effectively convert PDP lives or enroll PDP lives into MA. That's an untapped opportunity that exists within our portfolio today relative to our level of activity and initiation. Lastly, in your comment, we do recognize that the PDP landscape is disrupted, based on some of the legislative and policy activities that have transpired. And we will effectively position our portfolio, obviously, to be responsive to that disruption. But we have the tools to be able to manage within our portfolio in totality.  I'll ask Brian to pick up the second piece of your question, just relative to the script volume and the puts and takes in the portfolio this past quarter. Brian Evanko : Yes, as it relates to the adjusted home delivery and specialty scripts, you can think of a couple of different drivers in there. Specialty scripts continue to grow at attractive rates, so I think mid- to high single-digit-type unit growth. But given the relatively small numbers there, they're outweighed by what happens in home delivery.  So in that line item, you can think of 95% plus of the volume is home delivery, and less than 5% is specialty scripts, but attractive growth in specialty, which continues to drive the double-digit revenue growth that we've seen in that business all year.  The specific driver of the home delivery decrease, just to put a finer point on it, is we had a transitioning client that we've known about for several years, [indiscernible] had some outsized home delivery volumes, but we'll see some improvement in that on a go-forward basis with additional clients coming in. Operator : Thank you. I'll now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : First and foremost, thank you again for joining our call today and for the ongoing conversation.  Just to highlight and summarize our dialogue today, we are very pleased with our performance for the quarter and the momentum we've been able to carry now through 3 quarters of the year. And we remain on track to deliver our overall commitments for 2023.  We increased our outlook for adjusted EPS to at least $24.75 for full year 2023, as well as increasing the overall outlook we have for revenue, customer lives and cash flow based on our strong performance. And remain committed to our 2024 EPS objective of at least $28.  I do want to pause for a moment and thank my colleagues around the world. The health care landscape continues to change, with accelerated forces impacting our clients, our customers, our patients and our partners. And our team leads in day in, day out, working to make a positive difference, for those we have the benefit to serve, those we have the benefit to partner with, as well as our orientation around making a positive difference in the communities we work, serve and play in each and every day.  So I want to call out and thank our colleagues that continue to make such a positive difference in the marketplace each and every day. With that, we look forward to our ongoing conversation and our future dialogues, both in person and investor events as well as our fourth quarter conversation coming up. Have a great day.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe : Great. Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, The Cigna Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Evanko, Chief Financial Officer of the Cigna Group and President and Chief Executive Officer of Cigna Healthcare; and Eric Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evernorth Health Services. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics including our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results and our financial outlook for 2024. Following their prepared remarks, David, Brian and Eric will be available for Q&A. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures including adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of the cignagroup.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2024 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Pertaining to our financial results, in the fourth quarter, we recorded a net after-tax special item charge of $552 million or $1.88 per share. Details of the special items are included in our quarterly financial supplement. As described in today's release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2024 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2024 dividends. With that, I'll turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. 2023 was a very strong year for our company with consistent performance and sustained growth. We executed with discipline across our businesses. We delivered for our customers and patients, our employer clients, our health plan partners in the others we serve. And with our expertise and diverse breadth of capabilities, we continue to improve affordability and clinical outcomes as well as continuing our work to expand access and choice. As we look forward, we're carrying momentum into 2024 and we expect another strong year of performance in growth. Now today, I'll focus my comments on key strategic drivers of our performance last year and how we continue to evolve and advance our business to sustain our impact on growth. Brian will then walk through additional details about our performance for 2023 as well as our outlook for 2024. Then we'll take your questions. Now before I go into our results, I want to comment on the announcement we made earlier this week, we reached a definitive agreement to sell our Medicare businesses to HCSC. We expect this transaction to close in early 2025, following customary legal and regulatory approvals. And while we continue to see the seniors market as an attractive growth market, we concluded that our Medicare businesses well large at about $12 billion in revenue would require sustained investments and focus and capital as well as dedicated resources that were disproportionate with their size within the Cigna Group's portfolio. Additionally, with Evernorth's broad high-performing service portfolio, we will continue to serve the needs of seniors and grow our business. I would note that as part of our agreement, HCSC will be served by Evernorth for continued services for the customers we are selling. Additionally, we're expanding the reach of Evernorth's portfolio and see significant continued growth opportunities in Government services, including Medicare. Now as we consider the performance of our Medicare Advantage business in 2023, in the fourth quarter, results were in line with our expectations. And for the year, we balanced high-quality and competitive benefits offerings, continued target market expansion, and disciplined pricing activity. Now with that, let's move into our 2023 headlines. Probably for 2023, we exceeded our financial commitments. Full year total revenue, we delivered $195.3 billion. Full year adjusted earnings per share was $25.09 and cash flow from operations of $11.8 billion. This performance extends our track record of delivering consistent positive results, in the face of dynamic market conditions. It speaks to the power of our franchise and the purposeful way we've constructed our company, continuing to build on the strength of Cigna Healthcare, while also shaping and expanding our Evernorth Health Services platform to lead the way in addressing evolving needs in the marketplace. As a result of our focus, discipline and sustained execution, over the past decade, we've delivered adjusted EPS growth of more than 13% on an annualized basis. In the five years since our acquisition of Express Scripts, we've achieved or surpassed every goal we established for the combined company. Through 2023, we've grown revenue by over $50 billion and met or exceeded our adjusted EPS objectives each year. And we've returned $27 billion to shareholders through share repurchase as well as attractive dividend payments. In 2023, after increasing our outlook for adjusted EPS twice over the course of the year, we had a strong finish and delivered full year adjusted EPS that was better than expectations. In short, we've demonstrated the ability to profitably evolve our business and services that we provide over many years, which enable us to continue to deliver on our commitments and growth. Now I'll discuss our performance in greater detail. I'll start with Evernorth. In our Express Scripts business, we successfully implemented the single largest contract ever in the pharmacy benefits industry. Throughout 2023, thousands of coworkers collaborated and worked with dedication, so we'd be ready to begin fulfilling, well over 400 million annual prescriptions for 20 million Centene customers starting at the beginning of this year. Additionally, Centene was amongst hundreds of additional clients that were ready to serve in 2024 and I'm proud to say we're off to a strong start. The good work of our team has helped us meet the needs of our customers and reinforce the trust that Centene and of the clients place in our company. Another Evernorth highlight for 2023, is that we once again advanced industry-leading innovation. Last spring, we launched a series of innovations, including ClearCareRx, to support affordability, additional transparency and broader choice as well as independent Rx to partner and enable more closely with independent pharmacies. Then in November, we have further an expanding choice for clients funding their pharmacy benefits with Express Scripts clear network. We were the first to launch a scaled pharmacy network model offering cost-based pricing. In addition, our accelerated growth businesses with Evernorth fueled our momentum as well. Accelerated growth in Accredo specialty pharmacy and CuraScript SD businesses and in our care services businesses contributed to Evernorth's strong top and bottom line results. With Accredo and CuraScript SD, we are supporting patients and providers with safe and effective use of the growing volume of high-cost clinically compliant specialty drugs. We also continue building out our care service platforms to ensure patients can access care when and how they need it, while also remaining connected with physical sense of care. Our MDLIVE virtual platform, for example, is now available to over 60 million individuals as part of their benefits offering and is supporting the growing volume of care, including over 2.2 million virtual visits in 2023. Our results clearly demonstrate that with Evernorth's leading capabilities were valued and flexible partner for health plans, employers, governmental organizations and health care providers. In Cigna Healthcare, we drove revenue and customer growth through disciplined pricing and medical cost management. We serve employers and individuals who trust us to guide them through the health care system. Our leading clinical care programs could use to support our customers and patients, equipping them with the right information and insights they need to make the best choices for their health and vitality. Our ongoing pricing and continued progress in affordability initiatives in 2023 resulting in a medical care ratio that was better than expectations. Our U.S. Commercial Employer business had an outstanding year with continued strong growth. This was driven by our team's continued success in strengthening our competitive position through improved affordability and leveraging our high-performance networks and digitally enabled services as we expand care access, coordination of care and overall value. Our individual exchange business performed broadly in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter. And with the actions we've taken, we are on track to deliver improved profitability in 2024. In international health, we achieved another positive top and bottom line results. Our high-quality and localized health solutions, supported by our global provider network continue to resonate very well with the globally mobile population and employees of multinational corporations as well as intergovernmental organizations. Now turning to 2024. We will sustain our growth in high performance by sharply focusing on the greatest opportunities with a well-balanced portfolio of complementary businesses and a clear durable strategic growth framework. First, we will drive continued steady predictable growth from our high-performing foundational growth businesses. Pharmacy benefit, U.S. commercial employer and our international health business. Our clients depend on our pharmacy services, for example, and our expertise as well as our leadership in lowering cost for prescription drugs and addressing growing needs such as the high demand for the GLP-1 class of drugs for weight loss in diabetes. We have a long history of guiding appropriate access to medications and providing specialized clinical support and we will continue to build on these efforts with new programs such as our EnCircleRx program. We're also supporting customers in additional ways, including by offering enhanced digital tools to help them better understand the value of their pharmacy benefits. We've been successful in growing our U.S. Commercial Employer business for more than a decade and continue to view this as a growth market for the Cigna Group. We continue to leverage the strength in coordinating a growing number of point solutions for our clients and improving clinical outcomes for our clients. Additionally, we continue to act as a disruptive innovator for small and middle-sized client needs. Second, we will build on further momentum for our accelerated growth portfolio, our fast-growing scaled specialty pharmacy business and our care service businesses. We have tremendous opportunities in these large and expanding markets with our differentiated specialty capabilities, supporting patients with high cost and clinically complex treatments. And within Care Services, we're advancing our capabilities in behavioral health, virtual and home care, as well as coordinated care programs for specific conditions. In summary, for 2024, we will grow our customer and revenue base again and our earnings and operating cash flow at the higher end of our long-term strategic targets. We've increased our expectations for full year 2024 adjusted EPS to at least $20.25, we expect our consolidated adjusted revenues to grow at least 20%, and we expect to generate at least $11 billion of operating cash flow. And we will continue to return capital to our shareholders, including a 14% increase in our quarterly dividend. Now before I wrap it up and turn it over to Brian, I also wanted to mention the announcement we made last month about expanding roles for Brian and Eric. Brian has been our Chief Financial Officer for the past three years and will continue in that role. He will also expand his responsibilities as President and CEO of Cigna Healthcare. Eric is expanding his responsibilities as Executive Vice President of Enterprise Strategy for the Cigna Group, while also continuing as President and CEO of Evernorth Services. Brian and Eric's expanded positions, as well as other leadership changes we announced provide further clarity of our priorities and strategy, as well as the extent of reach and impact lucid to have. Importantly, it also reinforces the depth of our management bench. At our Investor Day on March 7 in New York City, you'll hear more from me, Brian and Eric, as well as other key leaders from across our company. We look forward to sharing with you our views of the expanded addressable markets we see and how we've positioned the Cigna Group to advance our next chapters of attractive growth. Now I'll briefly summarize. With the momentum we carried out of 2023, we are raising our guidance for EPS in 2024. We are building on a strong year of disciplined execution, performance and growth across our company. We deliver for our customers and clients and partners. We kept our commitments to our shareholders, including delivering adjusted EPS for 2023 of $25.09, which was above our outlook, and we generated $11.8 billion of cash flow from operations. We have sharpened the focus of our portfolio further to ensure that we are positioned to drive another strong year for our company. We are building on a consistent track record of disciplined execution, innovation and differentiated partnerships. We've increased our outlook for 2024 and now expect EPS of at least $28.25, and we will continue to advance the strategic deployment of capital, including using the majority of our discretionary cash flow for share repurchase in 2024. We'll have another strong year of performance, continue our track record for more than a decade of delivering against our 10% to 13% long-term adjusted EPS growth target, while maintaining an attractive dividend. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Brian Evanko : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review the Cigna Group's fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and provide our outlook for full year 2024. We're proud to deliver another strong year for the Cigna Group, reflecting focused execution and growth across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Looking at full year 2023, some key consolidated financial highlights include revenue of $195.3 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $25.09 and cash flow from operations of $11.8 billion, all well exceeding our initial expectations for the year. Fourth quarter enterprise results were particularly strong with revenue growing 12% to $51.1 billion, after-tax adjusted earnings growing to $2 billion, and adjusted earnings per share growing to $6.79. These results reflect broad-based strength across the company, and this momentum positions us well for growth in 2024. Regarding our growth platforms, I'll first comment on Evernorth. 2023 marked another year of sustained growth and profitability in Evernorth. As our market-leading clinical capabilities and innovative solutions continue to create differentiated value for our health plan, employer and government, clients and customers. Fourth quarter 2023 Evernorth revenues grew 12% to $40.5 billion and pre-tax adjusted earnings grew 10% to $1.9 billion, both of which exceeded expectations. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by continued strong performance in our specialty pharmacy business, which saw a double-digit year-over-year revenue growth to reach $60 billion in revenues for full year 2023. And our unwavering focus on reducing net costs for our clients as new drug innovations come to market, including GLP-1 agonists, biosimilars, specialty generics and other emerging therapies for clinically complex conditions. The fourth quarter capped a strong 2023 for Evernorth with pre-tax adjusted earnings growing 5% for the year, above expectations. We achieved this even while incurring meaningful spending related to the implementation of our Centene relationship. Evernorth's favorable revenue and adjusted earnings growth in full year 2023, reflected strong execution and expansion across our foundational business, Express Scripts and our scaled accelerated growth business, Accredo specialty pharmacy. Now turning to Cigna Healthcare. We outperformed expectations with full year 2023 pre-tax adjusted earnings growing 9%, reflecting another year of highly effective execution. Fourth quarter 2023 adjusted revenues were $13 billion and pre-tax adjusted earnings were $969 million, representing strong year-over-year growth. The medical care ratio was 82.2%, favorable to expectations. Our medical care ratio favorability was primarily driven by our U.S. Commercial Employer business, particularly within our stop-loss products, which outperformed expectations due to lower cost trends on high dollar claimants. Additionally, we saw lower-than-expected viral costs in the quarter with the combination of flu, COVID and RSV running below projections. As David noted in his comments, we have entered a definitive agreement with HCSC to sell our Medicare businesses. We expect to close this transaction in early 2025, following regulatory approvals. And our full year 2024 outlook assumes full year contributions from our Medicare businesses. For fourth quarter specifically, our Medicare Advantage business generated performance broadly in line with expectations. Across Cigna Healthcare, our full year 2023 medical care ratio was 81.3%, better than expectations, benefiting from our disciplined pricing execution, continued affordability initiatives, and the favorability in our Stop Loss products. The full year MCR of 81.3% was 70 basis points better than the midpoint of our initial 2023 guidance, and is an improvement of 40 basis points from full year 2022. Moving to Cigna Healthcare medical customers. We ended 2023 with 19.8 million total medical customers, growth of approximately 1.8 million or 10% from year-end 2022, ahead of our initial guidance. This growth was driven by U.S. healthcare, primarily from U.S. commercial employer fee-based customers, as well as growth in individual exchange and Medicare Advantage. Cigna Healthcare continues to perform well with strong underlying fundamentals. Our results reflect the strength of our differentiated value proposition and focused execution across the business as well as the stability and consistency of the U.S. commercial employer market. Overall, we're very proud of our strong 2023 results in a disrupted market environment, reflecting the intentional design of the company's growth platforms and our ongoing disciplined execution. This provides us with considerable momentum for 2024 and beyond. Now turning to our outlook for full year 2024, specifically. We continue to expect strong underlying growth in Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. We expect full year 2024 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $235 billion, and we expect full year 2024 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $8.025 billion or at least $28.25 per share, an increase from our prior outlook. When considering earnings seasonality, we would expect the adjusted earnings per share pattern to be similar to 2023. Now turning to our 2024 outlook for each of our growth platforms. At Evernorth, we expect full year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $7 billion. We expect adjusted earnings within Evernorth to ramp as we move throughout the year with first quarter adjusted earnings contributing slightly below 20% of full year Evernorth adjusted earnings. The earnings ramp reflects the effect of early year client-specific onboarding spend. These investments are more concentrated in the first half of the year and taper off over the course of the year. For Cigna Healthcare, we expect full year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $4.75 billion. Assumptions in our Cigna Healthcare outlook for 2024 include approximately 19.3 million total medical customers at year-end, and we expect our medical care ratio to be in the range of 81.7% to 82.7%, with the first quarter 2024 medical care ratio expected to be below the low end of the full year guidance range to reflect typical seasonal patterns. Additionally, for the Enterprise, we project an adjusted SG&A ratio of approximately 6.1% for 2024, reflecting a higher proportion of Enterprise revenue from Evernorth, which carries a lower SG&A ratio. And we expect the consolidated adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%. Turning to our 2023 capital management position and 2024 capital outlook. We finished 2023 strong and delivered $11.8 billion of cash flow from operations. In 2023, we repurchased 7.8 million shares of common stock for approximately $2.3 billion, and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders via dividends. Additionally, our debt-to-capital ratio finished the year at 40.1% and an improvement of approximately 100 basis points from year-end 2022. Now, framing our 2024 capital outlook, we expect to deliver at least $11 billion of cash flow from operations through our efficient service-based business model. We expect to deploy approximately $1.5 billion to capital expenditures. And we expect to deploy approximately $1.6 billion to shareholder dividends, reflecting our quarterly dividend of $1.40 per share, a 14% increase on a per share basis In 2024, we intend to use a majority of our discretionary cash flow for share repurchase. As we previously shared, we anticipate to, repurchase at least $5 billion within the first half of 2024. Finally, we expect full year weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of $282 million to 286 million shares. Now to recap, our full year 2023, consolidated results exceeded expectations, reflecting continued focused execution and discipline across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. And our 2024 outlook reflects continued strength and momentum across our two growth platforms, Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. We are confident in our ability to deliver full year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $28.25 per share. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator, for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. You may ask your question. A.J. Rice: Hi everybody and thanks for the question. Obviously, we have the announcement on your sale of the Medicare Advantage business. And yet you're saying you still view the business as attractive. Obviously, there's been some volatility in some of the performance of some of the other players in this space already announced. Is this the time in your mind to sort of step back from the market and give some time for the dust to settle? Or how should we interpret the comments that you still think that segment is attractive? And then also on that, obviously, is there a speculation at least in the press about deal discussions. Your stock was quite volatile. I wonder if you could give us a little bit on how you approach large transactions, some of the financial parameters that people should keep in mind that would be hopefully reassuring for them. David Cordani : Thank you. Good morning. It's David. You have a lot in that question. And I appreciate it. Let me try to address some of the high points. First and foremost, we are really pleased with the nature of the transaction we're able to structure with HCSC. We see it as a win-win. And it's a clarification to our strategy within our portfolio. As I noted in my prepared remarks while we view the market as an attractive growth market. The required capital investment resources focus relative to its size within our portfolio, coupled with the continued elevated regulatory environment, our decision was it was best to enter this transaction. Point two is, very importantly, we've been quite deliberate now for several years, working to expand the service portfolio and the value proposition within Evernorth for health plan partners as it relates to their government services, be it Medicare, be it duals, be it Medicaid, et cetera.  And we're demonstrating a very attractive proven track record of growing our government reach but through the services franchise, and we will continue to fuel that on a go-forward basis and see that as an attractive trajectory for us. As it relates to your latter part of your question, I'll reframe our M&A criteria. I want to make sure I put that in the context of our capital deployment criteria. We continue to view, first, capital deployment priorities, investing in our business. Brian referenced the CapEx deployment of about $1.5 billion. Second, we always evaluate M&A for its appropriate attributes, which I'll come back to in a moment. And then third, returning capital to shareholders. And as Brian noted, in 2024, in addition to raising our dividend by 14%, we expect to return the majority of our excess capital to shareholders through share repurchase with at least $5 billion in the first half of the year. Lastly, in your action pack question, as we think about the criteria for transactions, we think about three criteria : first, strategic attraction; second, financial attraction; and then third, overall path to clarity. So is it strategically aligned? Is it financially attractive? And as a final note, when we think about the financial piece of the equation, you evaluate each deal on its own respective merits. But seeking to get high visibility in terms of your value creation for your organization if you're going to enter into a transaction. So to repeat, we're pleased with the decision and the transaction design. We will continue in a long-term service relationship with HCSC that further expands our proven track record within Evernorth. We see the Evernorth service portfolio as an attractive capital-light high visibility way to grow this portfolio. And as we have in the past, we will maintain very strong discipline for capital deployment and our 2024 capital deployment priorities are quite clear. Thanks. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question. Stephen Baxter : Yes. Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to ask another kind of quick follow-up on the Medicare Advantage. So I would be curious if you'd be willing to share maybe your five- or 10-year view of the market. So I totally appreciate that it's a small part of your business before the sale. But you are still the eighth largest plan in the country. Do you think market share and concentration is ultimately going to look much more like the commercial market than it does today? Would love any kind of medium-term thoughts you could offer in the market. Thanks. David Cordani : Steve, good morning, it's David. You're asking for a 10-year crystal ball. I think in the dynamism of the marketplace, most people come back to in terms of rolling three-year views of a given market. But stepping back, first and foremost, the Medicare Advantage offering, broadly speaking, in the marketplace is a very attractive offering for seniors. And it has a long-term proven track record of delivering attractive benefits. And importantly, clinical coordination when you get to the Medicare beneficiaries, typically dealing with a higher level of clinical burden that's necessary for coordination. And the care outcomes, the quality outcomes, the overall value outcomes are positive. So broadly speaking, from a societal standpoint, we see MA as an important asset for the U.S. to continue to be served, supported financially and grow. Secondly, the marketplace will see ebbs and flows in terms of the funding mechanism. We see the early look at the rate letter at the moment in time. That's a moment in time, either acceleration or potentially deceleration for that marketplace. Third is, if you look at the senior satisfaction level, NPS broadly - Net Promoter Score broadly is attractive for Medicare Advantage. Therefore, as I noted previously to A.J.'s point, we worked really aggressively to ensure that we have a broad and we will continue to broaden the portfolio of services in support of health plans and integrated value-based care providers to be in support of value-based care, be it for Medicare Advantage tools or the commercial population. So we see the marketplace as a growth market. Its respective growth will ebb and flow depending on reimbursement to some level from the government, lending toward benefit richness. And then ultimately, as you know, the last comment I would make is the primary wave of the baby boomer aging has reached a peak and is slowing. It's still attractive, but that primary wave has reached its peak and is slowing somewhat. Take it as a whole, we see this as an expansion opportunity for Evernorth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much, and good morning. I want to focus on Evernorth and maybe just understand some of the key drivers as we think about 2024. So first off, you talked about specialty in 2023. Can you talk about what your expectations are about growth in specialty in 2024? What you're doing around services? You touched a little bit on GLP-1. But you had a really big contract with CNC coming on board, but you also had an overall good 2024 selling season. So any of the key elements you can help us to understand as to what the drivers are for that strong AOI growth in Evernorth? Eric Palmer : Thanks, Lisa. Good morning. It's Eric. A couple of different pieces in there. But first, let me just talk a bit about the portfolio of services that we're focused on in terms of Evernorth and transition that into some of the drivers of growth specifically for 2024. David noted in his prepared remarks, a couple of highlights on capabilities we're growing. But I would call out, we are seeing significant interest from the market around teams helping to better coordinate individual point solutions and alleviate some of the burden that comes along with the fragmentation of how care is administered and how employers and plans are assembling care. So us working to improve navigation and reduce point solution fatigue is a key item. Second of all, I would note, behavioral care continues to be an area of focus, and there's meaningful opportunity for behavioral care to be better coordinated as there's significant comorbidities with individuals with mental health care needs, along with other care needs, and we're in a position to help us address those challenges. The third item I'd note would be around specialty and in particular, the opportunity for us to continue to grow as there are more therapies, more choices in the specialty market as well as navigating through biosimilars. Overall, we're positioned really well to continue to drive affordability and choice in biosimilars. And as we've talked about previously, that's an important long-term multi-year tailwind in the economics and the growth of Evernorth overall. And then certainly, the continued growth in therapies like GLP-1s are is an area that's a factor in our proposition overall. So you put together that kind of touched on a number of the different capabilities. When you put together that suite of capabilities, that ends up being a really attractive portfolio that we've had continued growth in the number of lives we're serving, growth in our clients' lives that enable us to deliver the numbers that we're talking about. Overall, really excited about the momentum we've got going into 2024 and see ourselves as well positioned to deliver there and continue the trajectory beyond. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. You may ask your question. George Hill : Yes. Good morning guys. I guess just a couple of clarifying questions for me as it relates to MLR and the guide for '2024. You guys have kind of bumped up the medical cost expectations. Can you kind of disaggregate what you're seeing by line of business there? And I just want to confirm that the MA business is still kind of included in the continuing ops in the MLR guidance for 2024, because I saw in the footnotes it's kind of being carried as an asset held for sale. So, it just kind of like a, disaggregation of kind of medical cost expectations and trends expectations for 2024. Brian Evanko : Good morning George, its Brian. So let me just take the MA question first and then I'll get into the MCR. So as noted in my comments earlier, the Medicare Advantage business will continue to be reported through Cigna Healthcare through 2024. So all of our guidance whether that be the revenue guidance, the customer volume guidance, the earnings guidance, all assumes that the Medicare business will continue to be reported through Cigna Healthcare on an asset held-for-sale basis so, just to clarify that. So, all the metrics that you see line up with that basis. Within the MCR specifically, the midpoint of our guide obviously has a slight up-tick from where we were in 2023. Now important to step back and thank the 2023 MCR performance was favorable to expectations and the primary driver of the Cigna Healthcare income outperformance. We're just really pleased with the both quarter and full year coming in favorable to expectations. And as I mentioned earlier, the 81.3% full year MCR was 70 basis points better than the midpoint of where we had started the guidance early in 2023. So you can think of the primary driver of the slightly higher projected 2024 MCR as being our stop-loss products within the U.S. Commercial Employer business. As I mentioned earlier, these ran favorable to our target profit margins in 2023. And due to lower-than-expected cost trends in high-dollar claimants. For 2024, our planning assumptions are for the stop-loss products to normalize back into their typical target profit margin range. Secondarily, there is some product mix shift within the Cigna Health care portfolio between 2023 and 2024 that will impact the overall Cigna Healthcare MCR. Although, I would note that we expect the overall Cigna Healthcare profit margin percentage to be higher in 2024 compared to 2023. And we'd expect that to land near the low end of our targeted 9% to 10% range in 2024. And then finally, when you think about our MCR guidance, as always, our guidance does have an appropriate level of prudence to start off the year. George Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question. Josh Raskin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to get back to the Healthcare Services Corp. divestiture. Why was the PDP asset included in that sale? I would have thought that, that would have had strategic value on the Evernorth side and that you have an advantage on the cost structure. And then similarly, including Care allies as well, was that more a tie-in to the Medicare Advantage business? And what does that mean for broad sort of value-based care network development at Cigna? David Cordani : Good morning Josh, it's David. Let me take a portion of your question and then ask Eric to expand. And I'm going to come at the latter piece of it in terms of care allies and BBC, et cetera. First, your statement is correct. The thing about the care allies is specifically focused on the MA portion of value-based care. So therefore, there's alignment there. Stepping back on value-based care, we have a long history and again, a proven track record of delivering very strong positive results for the benefit of our clients, our customers and patients off of our value-based care orientation for commercial, for individual exchange, as well as for Medicare Advantage. As you know from our prior conversations, that's been a partner and enabled model as opposed to an owned model, broadly speaking. In terms of owning the care delivery versus partnering enabling. Additionally, I'd ask you to think about the commitment around that continuing. So our collaborative accountable care relationships for our commercial business and our exchange business continues on and our investment in and expansion of our Evernorth Accountable Care of capabilities as we support healthcare delivery system partners around their value-based care. That continues, including our strategic partnership with Village. So on the value-based care side of the equation, no change in strategy for us. this specific subset of our assets was solely aligned to the Medicare Advantage business. I'll ask Eric to talk about the direction relative to PDP and our multidimensional services relationship there. Eric? Eric Palmer : Thanks, David, and good morning, Josh. So two things I would note for you, Josh here. First of all, as David and Brian had in their prepared remarks, we will have a multiyear services relationship between Evernorth and HCSC building on a relationship that already exists there. So Evernorth will have the opportunity to continue to provide services associated not only with the prescription drug element of this business, but some of the other clinical coordination and related capabilities. So we're excited about that opportunity working to grow together. Specifically to the employer PDP item, you should think of here is Express Scripts continuing to be the face of the employer offerings and this being seamless with all of our clients and services with the role that will be played here around the insurance dynamics going to HCSC. But again, this will be a set of relationships that Express Scripts and Evernorth will continue to manage from a relationship and account management perspective, and we'll continue to be very involved in an area of focus for us. So overall, I'm very excited about the opportunity to continue to grow with another partner here. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. You may ask your question. Scott Fidel : Hi. Thanks, good morning. Interested just now with the sale of the MA business, how your priorities for investment and for growth in Cigna Healthcare may change from that? And obviously, you talked about how you've invested a lot in Medicare. So that should free up capital to invest in other businesses. So curious in terms of how you're thinking about where you can increase investment for growth in Cigna Healthcare, but also just how you're thinking about the exchange business now against the exit from MA just around your overall risk business in Cigna Healthcare will now be probably more weighted towards text, which is a pretty volatile business. So curious just on your thinking about the exchange business and sort of how you - how now you're going to sort of view that business post the sell VMA? Thanks. David Cordani : Scott, good morning, it's David. I think your umbrella tenant is right. So as I noted in my prepared remarks, the decision allows for sharpening of focus as we lean into our portfolio going forward. As you think about the investments, though, we have a long track record of making multiyear investments within our portfolio. So think about investments in a digital-first orientation and data-led capabilities continuing to invest in development of new programs and capabilities, be it what we talked about before with ClearCare or Pathwell capabilities. expanding the infrastructure and scale for a broader addressable market expansion and our proven CuraScript SD expansion as we face off and support a broadening array of health care professionals and integrated delivery systems. And I mentioned to Josh, the Evernorth Accountable Care capability. So think about, broadly speaking, our investment strategy continuing to fuel a variety of items and finally, sustained affordability, be it on the medical class pharmacy cost for administrative leverage that we get out of machine learning and AI through that lens. As it relates to the question around exchange or otherwise, we've always viewed the exchange business as sitting between commercial as well as the government. Obviously, the government influences a meaningful portion of that through the benefit design and otherwise, yet we are able to successfully leverage our collaborative accountable care relationships. And as we've demonstrated now for about a decade, with the exchange business by taking a very targeted focus within that market from its inception in 2014 to today, we continue to see that as a complementary aspect to our business. We will take very targeted positions, market by market as long as we have the right collaborative care relationships in place and have to be a complementary part of our portfolio. So I don't see the exchange posture is changing as a result of this. And broadly speaking, I don't think the investment strategy and the corporation changes as a result of it, it does create more capacity, though, as you articulated to accelerate in some of the categories I made reference to. I hope that helps, Scott. Scott Fidel : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. I was wondering if you could give a little more color about the membership guidance for 2024 by product. I know you're repricing exchanges, how is commercial going within commercial, the subsegments and then and then a little more color on the Medicare Advantage volume expectations, and I guess that's in the guidance as well. Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Kevin, it's Brian. So as it relates to the net decline we have projected in the 2024 Cigna Healthcare customers. You can think of the primary driver of this being the individual exchange business. As we discussed late last year, we took some needed pricing actions in certain geographies in the individual exchange portfolio, and this will result in net customer declines for this business in 2024. Within the U.S. Commercial Employer business, we expect customer volumes to be up modestly. But you should think of this by subsegment being split a bit. So we expect to see a net decline in our national accounts business, but this will be more than offset by the continued strong growth within our Select segment. And as a reminder, we continue to see opportunities for above-market growth in the Select segment, where our market share is still just 7%. And - when you think about the MA customer volume specifically, as we approach the 2024 bid cycle, as we always do, we apply a local market county level approach relative to how we price and set benefits. And so for most geographies, this resulted in stable benefits. A few areas, we had some targeted pullbacks just in light of the funding environment in 2024. And what we saw was in some of our local geographies, there was some very aggressive competitor behavior, which resulted in less net growth than what we had originally expected for the Medicare Advantage business. So taken all together, we would expect to see net customer volumes down slightly for year-end 2024 in comparison to year-end 2023 within the Medicare Advantage space specifically. But when you put all these pieces together, we're pleased with the overall balance in the Cigna Healthcare business right now is we expect to see profit margins expand year-over-year as I mentioned earlier, while we're serving a meaningful volume of customers that's grown markedly over the last two years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. On Evernorth, how are you thinking about the implications of cost-plus models and what that means at the PBM level and how does that influence your discussions with customers? Or just around your pharmacy network relationships. And just more broadly, just around transparency. And obviously, you talked about that in your prepared remarks in more transparent offerings at the PBM level and how do you think those offerings are gaining or not getting traction across your customer base? Thanks. Eric Palmer : Hi Erin, its Eric. First of all, just would not fundamentally, we start with the portfolio and approach that's equipped to offer a choice and - flexibility in how we work to support our clients. And so, that's the lens I ground back to. We're always open to looking at new ways and approaches and such that drive increased affordability and meets the needs of our buyers. And I'm really proud of the range of different financing solutions we offer and the number of innovations that we've delivered in 2023 and already in 2024 in terms of the types of options that we bring to our clients. And in fact, as David mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we launched our clear network solution, which was its first of its kind. It's comprehensive and simple solution to providing a cost index-based pharmacy network. A solution is unique in that it provides access to all the drugs in pricing that's based off of independent externally created cost on disease, kind of a simple margin that's shared between us and the dispensing pharmacy. So use that as an example. We had a lot of good conversations about that as a program and as an offering, but would note that the selling seasons for these types of things tend to be long in time. It's a long lead time in terms of implementation of such. So, some good conversations with our clients on solutions like that. Looking at other changes in the ecosystem, overall, with note, our clients are demanding more for their healthcare dollars. And are looking for ways to improve affordability overall and broadly are not interested in paying more for the same services that they received today. We've got a wide variety of networks and solutions that exist already in the market and the flexibility to adapt and adjust the configuration of our networks to trade-off costs relative to the value and access profiles that exist. So overall, we've got good flexibility, good capabilities and modularity to be able to approach and line up our capabilities best with what our clients need. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask a broader strategic question beyond MA. Most of your peers set up their business models over the last five to 10 years to manage a significant amount of their internal healthcare spend, right, and drive additional profitability and revenue from those services businesses. So with the sale of MA, you're repricing your exchanges which, makes sense, but your risk membership and the amount of medical costs you control, right, and are able to run through your services business just declines. How do you think about the value there are those individual synergies of controlling medical costs and being able to provide services there, the natural growth it provides each and every year, versus having to go out into the market and win each and every piece of business of growth, which obviously you've done pretty well over the last few years, but just the stability of kind of having that internal membership? And how should investors expect this to impact your capital deployment strategy going forward? Thanks. David Cordani : Justin, good morning, it's David. There's a lot in your question. Let me try to frame our thought process today and as we go forward. First, to date, we have a very clear proven track record of delivering a total cost, total quality, including clinical quality and service quality solution that resonates really well in the marketplace, whether it's in the benefit side of the equation or on the services side of the equation and our results reinforce that. Point two is we've successfully executed an approach that is on the delivery and fulfillment, a mix of partner and owned we continue to evolve our portfolio. But philosophically, we do not believe have not, do not and continue to not believe that you have to own everything to be able to fulfill. As you might recall, if you reflect back on prior conversations within our portfolio at Investor Days, we framed actually the amount of services that Evernorth, for example, was fulfilling at a point in time for the Signet Healthcare portfolio. And we frame the expansion opportunity to the point of your question that existed in front of us, and we continue to expand those services. Our model though is also importantly not predicated on only having economic alignment for guaranteed cost. We're able to do it successfully for self-funded or shared funding mechanism as well. So point two is we see the ability to continue to grow that over time with our Evernorth services portfolio. Point three is as it relates to services to continue to invest in. We've been very clear that certain services, we see additional step function opportunities to invest in and continue to grow. Most importantly, our proven scale, specialty capabilities. The rate of spending growth and clinical complexity around that is off the charts. We have a leadership position there that will continue to grow, and we will continue to be the market leader in that space through our assets. Secondly, the need statements around behavioral health in the most comprehensive way. The market expects now a much more coordination of behavioral and physical health and we will continue to expand services that we have within our leading capabilities. And third, just to stop at three for illustration is the breadth of virtual services. the ability to connect and coordinate and expand services as we go forward. So we agree with your point. I'll end with agreement with your point of continuing to invest in our services capabilities to be able to support the right services but we do not believe you have to own all aspects of the care delivery equation to be able to deliver that on a go-forward basis. So hopefully, that gives you a framing. As you might expect, we'll spend time on this at our Investor Day on the seventh because it's an important part of our strategy today and an important part of our growth strategy going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. You may ask your question. Lance Wilkes : Great. Thanks. Could you talk a little bit about over in the Cigna Healthcare side of the business employer, how penetration rates are going with the specialty products in self-insured? And if there are any interesting trends as you go into 2024 here as you look at the selling season in 2025 with respect to that. And then as you've gone through the selling season, any changes in employer priorities? And then also just a quick clarification on if you could just explain, there's a little drop in fees in the PBM. So that was just a clarification. The other one is a real question. Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Lance, it's Brian. I'll take the majority of your question. I think there's a number of different pieces in there. As it relates to the specialty products, and the attachment, if you will, to the medical in the Cigna Healthcare book of business, as you know, has been a long-standing part of the company's strategy because we see the value of clinical integration being much greater when we have multiple components of relationship with an employer. So that's been for many years, part of the company strategy. And important to bifurcate that by subsegment, certainly in the down market, we call the Select segment under 500. Most of those employers tend to buy the entirety of our offerings at once. So we have very high user work penetration rates in the under 500 and then comparatively lower when you get to the national account space where there tends to be a little bit more a la carte purchasing of the different services. So broadly speaking, I would say those patterns haven't changed too much over the last few years. On your question on the selling season, in particular and some of the employer preferences the 2024 selling season is largely over with the exception of the Select segment. As I mentioned earlier, that's an area for us that continues to grow at above market rates, and we're really pleased with. As we look forward to the 2025 selling season, we do have some national account RFPs in-house for both some existing clients and new business prospects. And directionally, RFP volumes are up a bit from prior years. Now each of these large clients, as you can appreciate, tend to have unique needs. That said, there are a few areas that I would highlight for purposes of kind of themes. So one would be some of our larger employers are seeking to consolidate vendors or point solutions with those who can supply more integrated offerings. So we tend to call that point solution fatigue. You may hear Eric or I talk about. Secondly, a team that's been around mental health and substance abuse benefits as these programs have become more and more important to employers from the standpoint of managing productivity, absences and overall health of their employee base. And thirdly, many of the larger employers are interested in digitally enabled care navigation capabilities to further power things like site of care optimization and consumer empowerment at the time that, that care is delivered. So we continue to see interest in those areas as well as various provider network configurations that may optimize cost quality and/or incentive alignment between the provider and the finance here. So our Cigna Healthcare offerings are really well positioned to address these themes and the demand from large employers will simultaneously continue to grow share in the under 500 select segment. I think David wants to add a few comments here. David Cordani : Sure. Just to amplify and add one more. The amplification is that point solution fatigue, that plays through in terms of opportunities for our Evernorth team as well as our Cigna Healthcare team. So around that, think about the ability to leverage solutions to get more value, better service, better clinical outcomes, overall value and affordability. Secondly I just wanted to reinforce a critical point when we think about penetration or cross-selling, sometimes it's thought through and you didn't state this, but sometimes it to through under the notion of you're just cross-selling products. The integration of the products to deliver more value to the clients and customers is mission-critical. So that shows up in better service quality, better clinical quality, improved affordability. And I would highlight that our sustained differentiated MLR performance is, in many cases, aided by our proven ability to integrate certain services they come together with benefit the clients that enables us to generate a high level of cross-selling and a high level of penetration. Thanks, Lance Lance Wilkes : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with TD Cowen. You may ask your question. Gary Taylor : Hi. Good morning. David, I was hoping to ask an action-packed question like A.J. did, but I'm afraid I'm going to be to in the weeds for that. I just want to go back to stop-loss, because it looks like a pretty substantial benefit to the 4Q and headwind. When I just look at how much your fourth quarter MLR outperformed your typical seasonal pattern, particularly in a quarter where there was broad trend acceleration? And then I try to square how much ACA enrollment and margin improvement should drive a tailwind 24 MLRs should actually decline year-over-year, but you're guiding it up. I mean it gets me to hundreds and hundreds of basis points of variance around stop-loss. So could you quantify how much that helped 4Q and how much of a headwind that is for 24? And then the second part would just be, walk us through again why you had such favorable performance in that line? Brian Evanko : Good morning Gary, its Brian. So, as it relates to the stop-loss book, as you know, this is a really important part of the Cigna Health care portfolio, and we finished 2023 with $6 billion of premium in that product line which to the earlier question, Lance attaches itself to our self-funded offerings in many instances. This book will naturally have some variability to it. So I wouldn't get overly fixated on 1 quarter's performance. There tends to be a little bit more settlement activity that transpires in the fourth quarter. So we had a little bit more of the favorability work its way through in the quarter, whereas if you smooth out over the course of the year, you don't have quite the same dynamic, which is one of the reasons why when you do the bridge from 23% to 24%, you shouldn't run rate the fourth quarter experience from that standpoint. So I mentioned earlier some of the moving pieces in the year-over-year MCR reconciliation, the 90 basis points increase from where we landed at the end of 2023 to the midpoint of the 24% guide. A key component of that 90 basis points is an up-tick that were anticipated in the stop-loss product which to the point earlier, is a function of our assumption that, that will normalize back to more traditional levels of profitability on the stop-loss products. So I think that's broadly the way I would encourage you to think about the dynamics at play here with that product line. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question. Dave Windley : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. And I appreciate that. The premise of my question here is that your Evernorth profit guidance for 2024 looks pretty highly visible to us. So my questions underneath that are one that you had guided 23% to include a ramping contribution from biosimilar, how should we expect that to continue, should that continue to ramp in magnitude? A then the second part was the significant onboarding costs for the Centene contract in 2023. Are you fully past those? Are those completely gone? Brian, you mentioned some Evernorth onboarding maybe unrelated, but Evernorth onboarding. In your remarks, I just wanted to kind of understand the relative size of those, so those two things, please. David Cordani : Good morning. It's David. Let me ask Brian to give you a framing in terms of - because you have a question relative to the trajectory in the year-over-year? And then I'll ask Brian to hand it across to Eric to give you a little bit more color of your question. The onboarding costs that, were really intense during 2023. And then some of what we're calling onboarding costs that leads into the early part of 2000 and 2024, give you a little color of what those services look like. But I'll ask Brian to frame the financials first. Brian Evanko : Yes. Thanks, David. Good morning, Dave. So overall, our AOI growth in Evernorth is expected to be about 9% as implied by the $7 billion or more of income that we expect in the year. And you can think of that as having the benefit of Centene related costs, now essentially normalizing back to a point where the profitability of that relationship will be in the range of breakeven. And then on top of that, we will have income performance. That's more in line with our traditional algorithm of 5% to 7% average annual income growth. And that reflects the benefit of all the multiyear trends that Eric talked about earlier, whether those be biosimilars, GLP-1 drugs, specialty generics, et cetera. So we certainly are seeing continued benefit from the biosimilar wave in 2024. But as I mentioned earlier, there's a bit of a specific and unique effect of the large amount of additional volume we're getting with the new client relationships in 2024. So Eric, maybe you can expand on that dynamic a bit. Eric Palmer : Great. Thanks, Brian. So with Centene, first, I would just start by actually noting how proud I am of how our team has delivered here and how we worked collaboratively across and with the Centene team. It's really been a great effort and one that's come together really nicely for the benefit of our now shared customers. implementation has gone really well, and the first month has been quite successful. Now consistent with what we've said before, and as Brian just noted, in 2023, we had meaningful implementation spending and no associated revenue generated a loss 2024. We have results that will be approximately breakeven in 2025. We expect to achieve our run rate margin for this contract, which will be lower than the overall of the business. With respect to the year 2024 timing that Brian alluded to before, you should just think about this, there's a lot more activity that has to happen at the beginning of a contract like this. There's more client outreach. There's work to get individuals into their therapies, et cetera. So there's normal effect here of just additional work and activity that has to take place in the first part of the year, and our expenses will reflect that. So that's a bit of that in-year shaping. But it's all consistent with what we had shared before. The final thing I'd note is consistent with our kind of normal practice now that Centene is a live client of ours won't be commenting going forward on specific profitability of a specific client or things along those lines, but know that the trajectory here is off to the same start we expected and consistent with what we had talked about previously. Operator : Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : Thanks. Just a couple of messages to reiterate. First and foremost, 2023 was clearly a strong year of performance across our company as we executed quite well, and it's reinforced by more than a decade where we've executed consistently as we've evolved our company and continue to grow our business portfolio and those we serve. We have confidence that we're going to sustain that momentum and leverage our well-balanced portfolio across our franchise and continue to deliver within our 10% to 13% long-term EPS growth range as well as pay an attractive dividend. Finally, I want to thank my coworkers around the world for their continued disciplined execution, their passion, importantly, in their caring orientation as well as dedication for those we serve. It shows up in our results. I'm really pleased and proud of what we delivered in 2023. And importantly, I'm even more excited for our expansion of our reach and impact in 2024. As a final note for you all, we look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day, which is a month away. So in early March, we look forward to seeing you in New York City and our team will be excited to talk about the market expansion we see in front of us, our capabilities and our opportunity to create additional value on a go-forward basis. Have a great day. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Cigna Group's fourth quarter 2023 results review.

    "content": "\ufeff Kevin Fischbeck : All right. I want to thank everyone for joining us today. It's my pleasure to be hosting The Cigna Group. Presenting today, we have Brian Evanko, who is the CFO of the company as well as President and CEO of Cigna Healthcare. We also have Hasan Riaz and Ralph Giacobbe for the company as well in the audience. So I think we should jump right into Q&A. I guess maybe take us -- one of the things that we're trying to figure out here at the conference is just kind of the backdrop for utilization. There's a lot of moving pieces and seems like some degree, different points of view about where we are in the utilization perspective. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing utilization, I guess, first in the core commercial book but then also any color on the Medicare Advantage side as well? Brian Evanko : Sure, Kevin. And thanks to you and Bank of America for hosting us here this week. As it relates to utilization, in 2023 across the board, we saw strong levels of utilization in our Cigna Healthcare health plan book, which is something we had priced for, guided for and included in our projections. And so as a result of that, you would have seen we had a strong year in Cigna Healthcare in 2023. The MCR performance was strong. The revenue growth was strong, in spite of what were elevated levels of utilization compared to 2020, 2021, 2022. So '23 was a stronger year of utilization. As we stepped into '24, we assumed those strong levels of utilization would continue through the entire year. So our pricing anticipated that, our guidance anticipated that and our projections did as well. So we are pleased with our first quarter results coming in better than expectations in Cigna Healthcare, where the MCR was better than we had projected and also the income was ahead of expectations, which again we come back to the firm pricing that we've had in the market, 2024 reflecting that utilization, is consistent with what we experienced in the first quarter. So far, the second quarter is largely in line with what we had expected coming out of the first quarter, which again is persistently high utilization levels relative to what we had in '23. In the first quarter, we had strong levels of inpatient utilization, a little bit of decelerating outpatient and surgery utilization, but still at high levels in absolute terms. So that's broadly how I would think about the picture we're seeing at The Cigna group. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And any different color on the Medicare Advantage side versus the commercial side? Brian Evanko : The Medicare Advantage book for us and granted we only have about 600,000 lives, so it may not be representative of the nation, has been broadly in line with our projections. Strong levels of utilization, '23 persisted through the first quarter of '24. So I wouldn't call it out as a significant outlier relative to our commercial employer experience. Kevin Fischbeck : And I guess let's talk about the commercial side for a minute. I mean, you're one of the few companies that really talks about commercial as a growth business. And to your credit, you have been growing commercial well. I mean, but what is the opportunity that you guys see in the marketplace overall? What type of growth can you think you can deliver in commercial? Brian Evanko : Yes, if you step back and think about the company in total, we've got three scaled growth platforms. We've got Cigna Healthcare, which is our health plan business. That's about 40% of our income. And our commercial employer business is the cornerstone in Cigna Healthcare. We've got our Evernorth Specialty and Care Services platform, which is about 30% of the company, which we expect to grow 8% to 12% per year on average. And then we have our Pharmacy Benefits Services business in Evernorth, that's about 30% of the company that we expect low- to mid-single-digit type growth on an ongoing basis. So three large scaled platforms. You asked specifically about the commercial employer business that's in Cigna Healthcare, which again is our health plan business. We've had a long track record of success here and part of it's the focus and the expertise that we've built up over time. But the opportunity we have going forward for disproportionately high growth is in the under 500 employer size segment, what we call the Select segment. So you can think of this employers who have between 50 and 500 employees. Today, we have about 7% market share. That's up from it was 5% just five years ago. So our share has been gradually building and we see the opportunity for that to eventually get into the double-digits from share standpoint, which is where our over 500 market share is today in the commercial employer space. We see that as a significant opportunity going forward. The reason we've been successful in that space is both improved affordability at a local market level, but also a very consultative model, that we've employed with employers from the standpoint of understanding how health benefits can be a weapon for them relative to talent attraction and retention and the fact that we're agnostic to funding arrangements. So we've for a long time had ASO or self-funded arrangements in the down market segment, which some of our competitors have been reluctant to do because it's lower revenue, even though it's very attractive from a profitability standpoint. So that's the subsegment within commercial employer that we're most excited about growth going forward. Kevin Fischbeck : Yes, I guess in Q1 when I looked at your commercial membership, the membership was down pretty much in every segment except for I guess the Select business. So what happened there? Why weren't we seeing better membership trends when the economy is doing relatively well? And then how should we think about the rest of the year? Brian Evanko : Yes, the Select segment, I'll come back to the core of the question, the Select segment, you can think of as having more rolling renewal dates. So because these are smaller employers, they're -- it's not as concentrated on January 1st. So we tend to see intra-year growth, in that sub-segment specifically, so the under-500 Select segment. So we'll see throughout the year growth, in terms of sequential lives into 2024. As it relates to your point on the larger segments, if you look at our middle markets and national accounts, we did have some self-funded fee based clients that were lost for 1124. We knew about that because from the standpoint of the pricing environment, we didn't chase the pricing. So not material to our income, but they did create a dent to the lives on 1124. Now that's on the heels of a couple of years of really strong growth. If you go back and look at where we were at the end of '21, our commercial employer book now is much bigger, 2 million, 3 million lives bigger. So it's we've had a lot of growth. But in this specific time period, we had a couple of known employer losses, Kevin. Kevin Fischbeck : And so then does that mean that the market's getting more competitive in that marketplace or is this just digesting recent growth? Brian Evanko : Yes, I wouldn't characterize it as more competitive in general because these are only -- there were two significant fee based clients. So out of the 100s that we serve in that space, I wouldn't necessarily conclude it's more competitive. We're broadly seeing rational pricing from our competitors. But here and there, you'll see a situation, where the pricing is a bit aggressive. Kevin Fischbeck : And so as far as the rest of the year goes, do you expect membership to kind of trend up from here as the year goes on, is that? Brian Evanko : We do. In the employer business, we expect there to be intra-year growth in the lives such that the full-year commercial employer book, year-end '24 versus year-end '23 should be flat to potentially up a bit. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then you guys are getting out of the Medicare Advantage business and you don't have a Medicaid business. Can you just talk about your views on the government business? Like why isn't that part of your portfolio strategy today? And it seems like almost every company has a diversified portfolio. Aren't there benefits of having that? Brian Evanko : There's a few different questions in there, so maybe I'll try to go deliberately through this to make sure the audience understands all the pieces in our thought process. So to your point, we're in the process of divesting our Medicare businesses as we speak to HCSC on track for early 2025 closing date of that. We've completed the DOJ review process. We got through the federal antitrust review already, so a couple of key milestones have already been met. Again, on track to deliver that divestiture in the first quarter or early part of 2025. Stepping back, though, why would we divest the business, I think is more where you were going with the question. We continue to see the Medicare subsector of the U.S. healthcare space as an attractive part of the U.S. healthcare market. So this was not a verdict about Medicare not being an attractive subsector. But for us, relative to where The Cigna Group is positioned, our strengths, our existing assets and where we can create the most value, we concluded that given its relatively small size in our portfolio, the amount of human capital and financial investment that would be required to scale it to a level that's significant for our company was too tall of a task and that it was best in someone else's hands. So that's what led to the decision to divest the business. So this was not a verdict about the Medicare market. It was relative to the size of our company and the things that we're prioritizing and focusing in. So I talked about specialty pharmacy earlier, our commercial employer business and the strength in our Pharmacy Benefits Services platforms. Those are getting disproportionate investment resources and we have a sustained right to win in each of them. Now, stepping back from that, our Evernorth Health Services business serves a lot of Medicare lives today. We serve a lot of Medicaid lives today, particularly with the win of Centene that has now gone effective, January 1st into our book. So we now serve 20 million or so so customers of Centene across Medicaid, Medicare and across the entire Evernorth portfolio. About 30% of all the customers we serve there are government sponsored : Medicaid, Medicare, DoD. So between our Pharmacy Benefits Services, specialty pharmacy, we serve a lot of Medicare, Medicaid, government lives, but through the services chassis as opposed to the health plan chassis. So in the long run, not having a health plan presence presents an opportunity for us strategically, something we could consider. It's not necessarily in the near-term where we're going to be focused, but it's an opportunity in the long-term for us to consider. Kevin Fischbeck : Is that true for Medicaid as well as Medicare or do you have a different view about those programs? Brian Evanko : Similarly to Medicare, after the divestiture, we won't have any health plan presence in Cigna Healthcare. And as we go through our strategic reviews of any decision that we make, we'll assess Medicare, Medicaid and other lines where we're not active. So I wouldn't say we have a stronger view of one versus the other in terms of the relative attractiveness. Ultimately, it'll come back to, as we think about the criteria for where we invest or the criteria for M&A, each of the specific situations would need to be -- need to be carefully reviewed. We have concluded that we don't intend to organically enter Medicaid or Medicare. So if we are in those lines in the health plan business, it would be through some sort of acquisition down the line. Kevin Fischbeck : All right. Can we talk a little bit about Evernorth then for a minute? You guys have kind of broken out that PBM business separately from the special two business. Can you talk a little bit about the decision to do that and why you think that's important for investors to understand? Brian Evanko : Sure. Yes, so starting in the first quarter, we divided the Evernorth business into two operating segments or subsegments. And again, stepping back, Evernorth is a health services platform for Cigna. It's about 60% of our income. And then Cigna Healthcare is the health plan, about 40%. So the 60% we divided into the two components. And part of this was we had a lot of questions coming in from investors to help us understand the pieces better. But also part of it is we wanted to make sure, we really put a spotlight on the Specialty and Care Services platform, which can you think of each of them as approximately equal today in terms of their contribution, 30% of the total company's income from both of those two operating segments. We found many people were taking our specialty pharmacy business and grouping it with the rest of our Pharmacy Benefits Services business and just thinking of that as a prescription drug oriented business. Yes, the two have very different growth profiles going forward. So the Specialty and Care Services business, $400 billion addressable market, it'll grow high-single-digits for the foreseeable future and we're the leader in that space. And we've expected 8% to 12% annual income growth out of that operating segment on a go forward basis and we've delivered that historically. However, we don't feel like everyone understands or appreciates the power of that business today, because historically, when it was lumped together with the rest of Evernorth, it was easy to say that's a big PBM. Yet, the reality is the specialty pharmacy business is really a heavy duty clinical care delivery model in a really attractive, highly growing addressable market. And so we wanted to put a spotlight on that for investors and allow you all to see the fact that that's going to be a very high growth business for the company and ideally think of it from a valuation standpoint differently than what the rest of Evernorth is, which is our Pharmacy Benefits Services platform, which we expect to grow 2% to 4% going forward. So it'll still grow and still has secular tailwinds, but not to the 8% to 12% growth rate of the Specialty and Care Services platform. So that's why we decided to go down that route, Kevin. We have a lot of questions and we wanted to put a spotlight on the high growth subsegment that we have within Evernorth. Kevin Fischbeck : And I guess maybe to that point, I think since this was the first quarter where we could look at it, it's optically looked a little bit strange when the PBM business grew so much off the Centene contract, but the specialty business didn't seem to get the same lift. Can you talk about why specialty didn't get the same bump that PBM did? Brian Evanko : Sure, yes. And you're right. We had the benefit of the Centene contract onboarding in the Pharmacy Benefits Services operating segment. So if you look at the quarter-over-quarter growth, it's very high in excess of 40% in the Pharmacy Benefits Services platform. Now, the Specialty and Care Services still grew 12% year-over-year, so nothing to sneeze at in that regard. But to your point, the Centene recognition, if you will in terms of where the financial show up is largely in the Pharmacy Benefits Services platform. So we have our Accredo Specialty Pharmacy as one of the specialty pharmacy options for Centene customers, but it's not exclusive. It's one of the options. So to the extent that a Centene customer fills a script at our Accredo Specialty Pharmacy, we recognize it in that subsegment. But the Lion's share of the relationship is in the Pharmacy Benefits Services platform today. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And when you think about that 8% to 12% growth algorithm, like how should we think about it? What are the key drivers to that? Brian Evanko : The most significant driver of that is the core secular growth in the specialty pharmacy market. And what I mean by that is looking back over the past decade or so, much of the innovation in health care has been in medical devices. Now we're starting to see pharmaceutical innovation not even in the early innings we're starting to get in the middle innings of pharmaceutical innovation over the next decade really being the next wave of health care. And the specialty pharmacy market in particular will see a lot of that. So whether it's gene therapies, Alzheimer's drugs, we're seeing right now the effect of GLP-1s starting to ramp, as you all know. Those are all examples of drug innovation that will drive high secular growth in that $400 billion specialty pharmacy market. And our Accredo Specialty Pharmacy today, we have depending on which measure you use in the 20% market share range, something along those lines. We have a scaled business in a high growing subsector with a lot of clinical experts, because these are high cost drugs. Often, they require temperature control or they require specific administration in a person's house or in a physician's office. So these are high cost drugs. This is not going down to your local drugstore and picking up a generic. They're complicated specialty drugs and we're really well positioned. So that's the primary driver of the 8% to 12% growth within there. The two others that I would highlight are we have a Distribution business for specialty pharmacy as well called CuraScript. It's been growing double-digits for many years. And we have an opportunity to see that grow, at an even faster rate on a go forward basis as more biosimilars are brought to market and more competition for high cost branded drugs enters the markets, we got an opportunity there. And then our Behavioral Health business, we have an opportunity for outsized growth there as well. Today, that's a relatively small part of the company, but there's a tremendous amount of demand for mental health right now both from our Cigna Healthcare customers, but also our external and affiliated clients that Evernorth serves. So all those things taken together lead to the 8% to 12% expectation. Kevin Fischbeck : That at last one, so the first two were actually kind of specialty drug driven the last one, that's a medical management overlay, not a pharmaceutical? Brian Evanko : Correct. Yes. So from the standpoint of trying to keep things simple, only having two operating segments in Evernorth, the specialty and care services includes primarily specialty pharmaceutical, but we have some health care services in there as well things like behavioral health, things like our MDLive Virtual Care, things like our EviCore medical benefits management. Kevin Fischbeck : And so it seems like everyone is talking about adding more of these services and these carve out benefits. I mean, what you -- how would you characterize the competitive environment today for these types of things like behavioral? It seems like, again, Elevance is doing it, United has been doing it, you're doing it like how do you win in that market? Brian Evanko : I think to this point, it's important to sub segment the employer space a bit more. I think your question is probably geared to the employer market, if I heard you right there. So the under 500 market that I was referencing earlier, we have outsized growth opportunity, what we call the select segment within Cigna Healthcare. Generally speaking, those employers are buying the full suite of solutions from us. They're not going through procurement for mental health separately from their medical benefits, separately from their prescription drug. They're generally buying the full suite of solutions from us. That's a function of generally, small HR departments. They want simplicity as opposed to having to go through complicated procurements and having to manage multiple partners. As you go upmarket, into the over 500 space and then eventually up into the largest employers, there tends to be more of the a la carte or multi-partner procurements. And so, that tends to be the case -- that's been the case for a long time. That's still the case. We're seeing a little bit of -- we use the term point solution fatigue where some of our largest clients I'd spend a lot of time with them in my Cigna Healthcare role have said, I've over time invested in some of these smaller point solutions, and they're not really paying back the way that I thought they would. So I'm looking for a more integrated solution, which presents an opportunity for us and some of our large scale competitors to see some consolidation from the point solution vendors. But broadly speaking, down market, we have everything in if we sell to the client. Up market, it's a bit more fragmented today with some opportunity for consolidation. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. Can you talk a little bit about, the PBM environment? You guys just won a large contract. Anything to highlight there as far as over the next year or two that anything you have up for re-procurement or any larger contracts that might be coming to market? Brian Evanko : The Centene contract that was just effective 1,124, far and away bigger than anything else that's in the kind of short to intermediate horizon for us. And for '25, we'd expect based on where we sit here in the middle of May, mid-90s or better retention on our PBM book of business, based on where things stand and a few opportunities for new business coming in as well. That's all factored into the forward-looking 2% to 4% average annual growth algorithm for the Pharmacy Benefits Services business, but not anything anywhere near as sizable in the '25 cycle that's we had with Centene. Kevin Fischbeck : And as far as the Centene contract, I guess last year was a drag, you should prepare for it. This year it's talking more break even and next year you should be at target margins. Is that are you still on track for that dynamic? Brian Evanko : We are on track for that dynamic. So we don't intend to every quarter talk about the financial performance of Centene. But that broad picture you just painted is consistent with our latest expectations. '25, we should be at run rate profitability on the contract. And the installation went great. So, we still have regular dialogue with Centene. They've been pleased from everything we've heard in terms of the operational performance, which was not an easy thing to do to bring 20 million new customers over into our environment. We're really pleased with the performance from the team. Kevin Fischbeck : All right. Great. Can you talk a little bit about, just going back to the Health Plan business, the exchanges? You guys pulled back noticeably on the exchanges in a couple of states. Where are the margins today and how do you view the exchanges going forward? Brian Evanko : Sure. So the exchanges are within Cigna Healthcare for us, and you can think of it as this year about a $4 billion book of business from a premium standpoint. So within Cigna Healthcare, that represents under 10% of the total, but it's an area we see growth opportunity on a go forward basis. Now, we had to do some repositioning in '24, because '23 in two of our largest states with the benefit of hindsight, we underpriced the business in two of those states. And so we went through, a new product positioning as well as a repricing exercise in two of those states, which led to a reduction in membership year-to-date, as we expected. So the good news for us is we've delivered '24 where we needed to from the standpoint of fewer customers, but more profitable. As we went through the repricing that I made reference to, our '24 expectations are that the book itself will run slightly below our target margins, and our target margins are 4% to 6% on that business, so we expect to be slightly below that. That's what's incorporated in our guidance. The first quarter and the April experience is consistent with that expectation. Kevin Fischbeck : Is that would you expect to be at target next year [indiscernible] repricing? Brian Evanko : Barring any unforeseen events, that will be our expectation. Kevin Fischbeck : I think you guys have a longer term view that that business will grow, is it 10% to 15%? Brian Evanko : Yes. So inherent in our -- in Cigna Healthcare, we expect average annual income growth of 7% to 10%. Within that, we expect the individual exchanges to grow 10% to 15%. So the weighted effect of 10% to 15% versus the other components gets to 7% to 10% at the total Cigna Healthcare level. Part of that for us is addressable market expansion, since we're only in about a dozen states. So we have new states we can get into. Some of the existing geographies, our market share is lower, so there's opportunity there. And ultimately, that $4 billion of premium we see growing in time. Not that the entire company, of course, isn't predicated on that business performing, but we see it as an important part of the health care system. Kevin Fischbeck : Is that the only part of your commercial business that was kind of under target? Are you generally speaking back to target margin and commercial outside of exchanges? Brian Evanko : Yes. So Cigna Healthcare, if you think of the components, the U.S. Employer business essentially at target margins, the International Health business essentially at target margins, the individual exchange a little bit below as we just talked about. And then our Medicare business, which we're in the process of divesting currently weighed down by SG&A, so it's below targets. Although the medical care ratios are not out of line with where we would expect. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. It's interesting. It feels to me like Cigna is in a pretty good spot right now. When I think about next year, there's not really any obvious headwinds that I can see to your business. So next year you're going to have trends going to remain high, unit costs seem to be driving commercial trend and that's probably going to be high again next year. So that's good for revenue growth. You've got the Centene contract ramping up. It sounds like the RFP pipeline is going well on the PBM side. So it seems like everything's kind of going well in your favor. Is there anything we should be thinking about from a headwind perspective that, is an offset or anything that keeps you up at night as far as next year's growth goes? Brian Evanko : I hate to say there are no headwinds, but there are no known headwinds that are sizable that I would highlight, and I broadly agree with the framing that you provided there. And actually, two months ago on our Investor Day, you all may have noticed we increased the ceiling of our EPS growth algorithm on a go forward basis. It was 10% to 13% for a long time. We increased it to 10% to 14%, because we see the next several years being opportunities for strong rates of growth, despite it being a pretty disrupted environment that we're operating within. So whether that's -- the forces you described or the drug innovation that I made reference to, all those things contribute to our businesses being really well positioned for the next few years and not a specific one, two, three headwinds that I would call out as we step into '25. Of course, we always have to respect the fact that medical cost utilization could be higher than expectations. And of course, we're always going to be investing in operating expense or making investments in strategic capabilities that could weigh on operating expenses in any given time period. But broadly speaking, don't see any notable one time headwinds. Kevin Fischbeck : Yes. And then, you talked a bit about the share repo that you're doing this year. You guys are in the process of doing the first $5 billion. What's the appetite or ability to do it to continue share repo on the back half of the year? And your good debt to cap is in Q1 was 44%. You guys usually talk about 40% as the target. How does that play into how you think about share repo and the timing? Brian Evanko : Yes. So we've continued to see our shares as a great use of our deployable capital, which is one of the reasons we've done so much share repurchase the last few years. And in '24, we've committed to the majority of our discretionary cash flow going for share repurchase. We're on track to deliver against the commitment we made, which is at least $5 million by the end of the first half of '24, so at least $5 billion to share repurchase. So we've we initiated a $3.2 billion ASR in February that will complete by the end of this month. And then we'll do some open market repurchase to achieve that goal by the end of June. So we're fortunate to have the cash generation that allows us the flexibility to do this sort of repurchase. And as you think about the back half of the year, even after you remove CapEx and you remove shareholder dividends, there's still call it, $3 billion or so of fungible cash that will be available for deployment between either some debt repayment to the extent we de-lever a bit or to the extent we see a strategic M&A opportunity. So we see those buckets as a bit fungible in the back half of the year, but we continue to see share repurchase as a very attractive lever for the company. To your point on debt, we were a little bit elevated in the first quarter from the timing of our debt issuance, which was part -- in part to fund the ASR. We also had, a write off of one of our assets that temporarily elevated the debt to cap. Over time, we're committed to a 40% debt to cap ratio. That's what we've aligned with our rating agencies on. And so the times we'll be above that. We were at 40% at the end of the year. So we'll de-lever down to that level at some point. Kevin Fischbeck : And I guess when you think about -- you guys talk about 65% of your cash flow either going to M&A or share repo. And I appreciate, viewing your own stock as attractive. We do too. But if you think about M&A, one of the pushbacks that I have on Cigna's strategic capital deployment, it just seems like that there should be something out there that could kind of push the company forward. But since you bought Express Scripts, you've raised more money in asset sales than you've deployed on acquisitions. And so it feels like everyone around you is kind of more aggressive on deploying capital. So what are your thoughts about, I don't want to say it's an arms race, but like -- are you missing out on anything? Is there anything that you look at today and say, yes, it would be better to have this or that? Brian Evanko : Yes, we see M&A as an important part of our capital deployment strategy, so full stop. And even though, to your point, there haven't been as many high dollar, high profile acquisitions since we acquired Express Scripts, it's a constant area of review and focus for us strategically. So to your point, 60% to 65% of our capital available for deployment we see as fungible between M&A and repurchase, but we're not going to sit on cash either. So if there's not an attractive M&A prospect, we're going to use the repurchase lever because we view our stock as a very good investment, with where we sit today. Now strategic M&A for us falls into a few different categories. There's where can we improve our competitive position and our competitive advantage in our existing businesses. So I went through the different components of the company earlier. And then there's where can we expand our addressable market, our reach, which could be in Cigna Healthcare. We talked about a few of the lines where we don't have a presence or we won't have a presence in the future or it could be in Evernorth where we have more opportunities for services, particularly health services. So those are examples of areas that we're constantly looking at. But importantly, every asset needs to be viewed individually and we put it through the lens of does it strategically push the company forward, is it financially attractive, meaning accretive over time and meeting return on capital expectations, And can we get it done, both from the standpoint of having the right counterparty and getting through antitrust. Kevin Fischbeck : I guess I understand getting into new markets or getting to new geographies. What does it mean, say, to improve your competitive positioning? Like what does that mean? Brian Evanko : So in the three large scaled assets I made reference to Cigna Healthcare, Specialty and Care Services and Pharmacy Benefits Services, there are examples of ways where we can further extend our advantage into subsectors. So, in Cigna Healthcare, we have certain geographies where we're less competitive. In the Specialty and Care Services business, we're a little more nascent as it relates to serving health systems and hospitals. Those are examples of within already large scale businesses where there could be an advantage to build. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, I think that is all we have time for. Thank you very much. Brian Evanko : Thanks Kevin. I appreciate the time. End of Q&A:",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by for the Cigna Group Second Quarter 2024 Results Review. At this time all callers are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the call over to Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, the Cigna Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Evanko, Chief Financial Officer of the Cigna Group and President and Chief Executive Officer of Cigna Healthcare; and Eric Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evernorth Health Services. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including our second quarter financial results and our financial outlook for 2024. Following their prepared remarks, David, Brian and Eric will be available for Q&A. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures, including adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally, accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of the cignagroup.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2024 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Regarding our results in the second quarter, we recorded an after-tax net special item charge of $64 million or $0.23 per share. Details of the special items are included in our quarterly financial supplement. Additionally, please note that we will make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2024 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2024 dividends. And with that, I'll turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. For the second quarter, we again delivered strong performance as we continue to build on our momentum. Today, I'll discuss our performance for the quarter and key strategic drivers of our growth, demonstrate how the strength and durable nature of our model is fueling our success. Then Brian will review additional details on our results and our outlook for the rest of the year, and we'll move to your questions. So let's get started. For the second quarter, I'm pleased to report that the Cigna Group delivered total revenue of $60.5 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $6.72. We achieved these positive overall results in a dynamic environment, and I'm proud of our team for continuing to focus on those we serve, ensuring that they get care of the need, to get their medications at an affordable cost and they get the support they need in order to make the best decisions about their health and vitality. All of this requires a relentless focus on innovation, disciplined execution and a passionate commitment to our mission. During the quarter, our Evernorth Health Service businesses demonstrated continued strength with our market-leading specialty and pharmacy benefit services capabilities. Within Evernorth, I'll start with our accelerated growth specialty and care businesses, which provides specialty drugs for the treatment of complex and rare diseases, distribution of specialty pharmaceuticals as well as clinical programs to help clients improve health and vitality. We saw strong growth in the quarter with adjusted income growing 12% year-over-year, reflecting continued demand for our services while we also continue to invest in broadening our offerings and expanding our reach. In Accredo, our specialty business, our growth continues to be fueled by secular tailwinds as well as Accredo's differentiated strength which makes us the market leader in the space. Biosimilars, for example, represent a force of change and a substantial opportunity for continued growth and impact. At the end of June, we began dispensing our interchangeable biosimilar for Humira. Our program has zero dollar out-of-pocket cost for patients, saving them on average $3,500 per year. To deliver these savings, we have agreements in place with multiple manufacturers that will produce biosimilars for Evernorth pharmaceutical distributor, Quallent Pharmaceuticals. Now the biosimilar opportunity goes well beyond Humira. By 2030, we expect an additional $100 million of annual specialty drug spend in the U.S. will be subject to biosimilar and generic competition. And Accredo is well positioned to deliver differentiated value for our clients, customers and patients. In our care services businesses, we are continuing to grow and expand in key areas of increased demand, including behavioral health, virtual and home care. For example, in summer, we further expanded Evernorth behavioral care group to an additional seven states. We are seeing positive patient outcomes from our unique clinician matching capabilities based on individual needs and preferences with fully 84% of patients experiencing clinically significant reductions in the depression and anxiety symptoms. Now shifting to Express Scripts, our foundational pharmacy benefit services businesses, we are seeing continued strong client demand given our breadth of clinical and supply chain expertise as well as our proven partnership orientation. This quarter, Express Scripts built on a long track record of innovating for those we serve with continued enhancements and new solutions. For example, given the high cost of GLP-1 drugs, we're continuing to see meaningful interest from our clients in EnCircleRx, now with more than 2 million lives already enrolled. Our program starts with our longitudinal data to target patients who will most benefit from these medications and we provide patients with resources to make lasting changes to help maximize the effectiveness of these medications, both in the short and long-term. Another example of our innovation orientation is a recent announcement of Express Scripts oncology benefit services, which will be available in 2025. Our new solution helps patients navigate the challenges of cancer care by providing a single oncology benefit, integrating pharmacy, medical and behavioral health treatments. Our patient centered approach will help to ensure the earliest possible detection guide individuals to high-quality providers and coordinate care across clinical teams. Now moving to Cigna Healthcare, our health benefits platform, we continue to deliver solutions that create value and better outcomes for clients and customers, coupled with highly competitive total cost of care. Similar to others in the industry and as we've anticipated, we are seeing increased utilization in our book of business. I would note that our results are largely in line with the elevated levels in our planning and pricing assumptions. Our U.S. employer foundational growth business continues to perform in line with our expectations. Over this year, I've met with hundreds of clients across the U.S. and globally. And while the needs of every client are unique, there are a few consistent themes across every discussion. First, continued focus on affordability, particularly in light medications like GLP-1 and gene therapies coming to market. Next, an increased need of improved access and importantly, coordination of behavioral health services. Third is mounting point solution fatigue. And fourth, the opportunity and need for leverage of our longitudinal data and clinical programs to help keep people healthy and vital. Our solutions continue to resonate well given our highly consultative approach to help clients choose the right set of solutions, our proven capabilities to support their workforce and our innovative programs that help to keep costs down. As a result, we are further gaining share and continue to see outsized opportunities, for example, in our Select segment. Another capability of our U.S. employer business to deliver integrated and tailored benefits for our clients and customers, our modular solutions that incorporate innovative services from Evernorth, including Behavioral health, virtual care and pharmacy. Our Pathwell suite of solution, which continues to drive exceptional value is a prime example. Pathwell specialty is another way we are reducing costs associated with specialty drug therapies, while also providing improved care and clinical outcomes for patients. With our Accredo nurses, nearly 50% of our Pathwell specialty patients, who've transitioned their site of care, now receive treatment in the comfort and convenience of their home. We are pleased with how the market continues to recognize the value we are delivering through solutions like Pathwell. Turning to our Medicare Advantage business. We continue to make great progress regarding the sale of this business, and I'm pleased that we remain on track to close in the first quarter of 2025 as planned. Next, I want to take a few minutes to talk about the current environment surrounding pharmacy benefit managers and the relative landscape. At the heart of this debate is the cost of pharmaceuticals. As we previously discussed, a key force of change in health care is the surge of pharmacological innovation. For context, prescription drug coverage is the most frequently used care benefit. And on average, it used 15x per year per person resulting in billions of dollars -- billions of prescriptions per year annually in the United States. Today, and for the foreseeable future, and most meaningful advances extending and improving quality of life will come through gene therapies, breakthrough and treatments for cancers and other conditions as well as personalized medicines. In the U.S., for example, there are already more than 20 gene therapy and cell therapies available. However, there are nearly 1,000 more in the pipeline. Additionally, as we know, GLP-1s are growing rapidly, helping to treat diseases and complications that stem from obesity and diabetes. This class of drug is on tap to be the #1 pharmacy benefit trend driver for plans of all sizes this year. And the impact will grow with some forecasting nearly 10% of the U.S. population using GLP-1s in the next 10 years or sooner. The applications rippling from these fast-growing pharmaceutical trends across the entire health care system are undeniable. And one of the biggest unanswered questions is how could society afford this continued trajectory? Our role is to negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as pharmacies to ensure that individuals are able to access pharmacological innovations at a fair and affordable price. In fact, pharmacy benefit companies are the only part of the drug supply chain who work to drive cost down. To underscore this, new drugs coming to market with unsustainable prices in 2023, were up $300,000 on a median basis, up over 35% over 2022. And last year, median brand drug price increases were greater than 5% more than the rate of inflation. Let me repeat this. Last year, the median annual price for new drugs coming to market was $300,000, up 35% over 2022. Meanwhile, in 2023, Express Scripts change in pace and cost sharing was relatively flat on average. Express Scripts patients with employer sponsored drug coverage pay, on average, $15 out of pocket for a 30 day supply. And for clients, Express Scripts delivered more than $38 billion in savings annually. Stepping back, our industry negotiations to drive these results can at times generate friction in the system. Friction that is spilled into and now has reached tightened levels in the political arena and media with industry winners and losers being declared at every report and every headline. We believe that the facts and results and outcomes delivered to our clients, customers and patients will rule the day. However, the environment calls on us to be more proactive. This means ensuring that what we do and the value we bring is more widely and better understood. And we continue to evolve our model to address legitimate pain points and opportunities. For example, in 2023, 1% of the patients in the United States experienced out-of-pocket costs above $2,000 a year. From our point of view, that's too many. We accept the responsibility to accelerate innovation to make medications more affordable, while continuing to improve health outcomes in finding solutions for every person we serve. Make no doubt our team will continue to lean into the challenge for the benefit of our patients, clients and the health care ecosystem and we are proud of the work that our team does every day and the role we play and the results we're able to achieve. Now let me pause and summarize before transitioning to Brian. When you combine our compelling growth potential and strong execution focus, we have confidence in our ability to meet our 2024 and long-term growth targets. We have a proven track record of delivering differentiated value for those we serve by innovating new solutions like in EnCircleRx and our Pathwell suite as well as expanding meaningful partnerships. As a result, in the second quarter, we delivered on our financial commitment with adjusted EPS of $6.72, and we remain on track to deliver our guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of at least $28.40 for 2024. Further, our company has attractive sustainable growth opportunities over the long-term, and we remain on track to deliver average annual adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 14% and building on our track record of achieving 13% adjusted EPS growth over the last decade, all while we generate cumulative operating cash flow of $60 billion over the next five years, while continuing to meaningfully invest capital for the benefit of shareholders. We also continue to make strategic investments in strengthening our capabilities in our foundational and accelerated growth business and remain focusing on harnessing the breadth of our capabilities of our organization to meet the evolving needs of those we serve. Overall, our strong performance through the first half of the year reflects the balance in our company portfolio and the significant value creation that positions us for sustained and differentiated growth. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Brian Evanko : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review Cigna's second quarter 2024 results and discuss our outlook for the full year. We're pleased with our strong second quarter results, reflecting growth across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. The results underpin the strength and the stability of our diversified portfolio of businesses in a dynamic environment and demonstrate continued execution against our operating and financial commitments. Key consolidated financial highlights for the second quarter include revenue of $60.5 billion, which represents 25% year-over-year growth and adjusted earnings per share of $6.72 or 10% year-over-year growth. With the strong first half performance, we continue to have confidence in our full year 2024 adjusted earnings per share outlook of at least $28.40, which represents more than 13% year-over-year growth in EPS. Now turning to our segment results. I'll first comment on Evernorth. Evernorth continues to deliver strong results driven by both of its operating segments. Second quarter 2024 revenues grew to $49.5 billion, while pretax adjusted earnings grew 7% to $1.6 billion, slightly ahead of expectations. Specialty and Care Services showed strong growth with revenue up 18% to $22.9 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were up 12% to $756 million, at the high end of our long-term target growth range. This performance is a demonstration of our robust and diversified capabilities, as we delivered broad-based growth across our specialty businesses, Accredo and CuraScript as well as in our care services businesses. Pharmacy Benefit Services also posted strong revenue growth, driven by the addition of new business wins and expansion of existing relationships. Pretax adjusted earnings increased to $798 million as our innovative capabilities continue to drive value for our clients, customers and patients. Overall, we're pleased with Evernorth's second quarter results and continue to expect strong income growth in the second half of the year. Turning to Cigna Healthcare. Second quarter 2024 revenues were $13.2 billion and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.2 billion. Second quarter earnings were in line with expectations and included approximately $50 million of unfavorable prior year impact related to Medicare Advantage risk adjustment. The second quarter medical care ratio of 82.3% was within our expected range, inclusive of the aforementioned unfavorable prior year impact of approximately $50 million or 40 basis points on the medical care ratio. Absent this item, the underlying medical care ratio was broadly in line with expectations. As noted previously, we had planned and priced for 2024 medical cost trend to be above 2023 levels, which took into account both unit cost inflation as well as continued elevated utilization. Year-to-date, we have seen elevated cost trends, consistent with our planning and pricing assumptions. The net medical cost payable at the end of the second quarter was $5.04 billion, compared to $5.66 billion at the end of the first quarter. As noted previously, in the first quarter, we had booked approximately $650 million in incremental reserves relating to the Change Healthcare disruption. Those reserves have since developed in line with expectations and claims payments have returned to more normalized levels. driving the sequential decline in net medical cost payable. Moving to Cigna Healthcare Medical Customers. We ended the quarter with 19 million total medical customers. We expect growth in Cigna Healthcare medical customers for the remainder of the year, primarily driven by growth in our U.S. employer Select and Middle market segments. Overall, Cigna Healthcare delivered consistent results in a dynamic operating environment. Now turning to our outlook for full year 2024. With our continued strong underlying performance in Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, we are reaffirming our full year 2024 expectation for consolidated adjusted income from operations of at least $8.065 billion or at least $28.40 per share. Regarding cadence of earnings, we expect the third quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 25% of the full year outlook. Now turning to our 2024 outlook for each of our growth platforms. In Evernorth, we continue to expect full year 2024 pretax adjusted earnings of at least $7 billion. This reflects continued momentum into the second half, with third quarter Evernorth earnings expected to accelerate to high single-digit year-over-year growth, in part due to an increase in adoption of our interchangeable biosimilar offering. For Cigna Healthcare, we continue to expect full year 2024 pretax adjusted earnings of at least $4.775 billion, and we expect the third quarter adjusted earnings to be approximately 25% of the full year outlook. We continue to expect the full year medical care ratio within the range of 81.7% to 82.5%. With the first half medical care ratio coming in at 81.1%, the midpoint of our guidance implies an 83.1% medical care ratio for the second half of the year. We would expect the third quarter to be slightly below that level. Turning to our 2024 capital management position. As of July 31, we have repurchased 14.7 million shares of common stock or approximately $5 billion, consistent with our previous commentary. We continue to expect at least $11 billion of cash flow from operations. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our efficient asset-light framework that drives attractive returns on capital. Now to recap. Our first half 2024 consolidated results reflect strong contributions and execution from both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Our 2024 outlook reflects the sustained momentum and strong fundamentals of our two growth platforms, which gives us confidence to deliver on our full year 2024 adjusted earnings per share outlook of at least $28.40. With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Our first question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : Appreciate the commentary on cost trend. Maybe you can give us an update on what you're seeing by business line and also how things have trended 2Q versus 1Q? When you say it's in line with your pricing and your expectations, is that a year-to-date discussion? Or is that where trend is running today coming out of the second quarter? Is that in line? Or is that more or less elevated versus what you expected? Brian Evanko : Justin, it's Brian. So I'll start by saying we're pleased to have delivered another solid quarter of MCR performance at Cigna Healthcare which ran toward the lower end of our MCR guidance range when you exclude the prior year Medicare risk adjustment revenue impacts in the quarter that I mentioned earlier. Now within the quarter, total cost of care was broadly in line with expectations. There are a few puts and takes that I call out if we get into specific cost drivers. So we continue to see elevated usage of facility-based services, including emergency room. Additionally, we saw a continuation of elevated utilization of mental health care services, which we do see as a positive over the longer term given the correlation to whole person health. You'll recall in the first quarter, I highlighted slowing growth in surgical costs. During the second quarter, we continued to see abatement in the rate of growth of surgical costs although costs still didn't grow. Now taken all together, we are seeing sustained high cost trends, yet these are broadly in line with our guidance as we planned and priced for the elevated utilization levels that began in 2023 to continue throughout 2024. Now specifically in the second quarter, we did not witness aggregate acceleration or deceleration of care patterns within the quarter. I also would not note any month-to-month variability relative to the year-to-date experience that we've seen. So overall, we remain confident in the full year MCR range outlined in our guidance. Operator : Next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : I want to start with the 2025 selling season on the pharmacy side. You made comments around GLP-1. We continue to see new indications there. I'm just curious, one, when we think about the opportunities in '25, how would you characterize that to what kind of programs are people buying going into 2025? And then lastly, David, you made a comment that the facts need to be more widely understood when it comes to the pharmacy business. What are your plans around making those facts more wiping known? Because as you know, I agree with you that both Congress as well as the media reports don't fairly reflect what the benefits are of the business. Eric Palmer : Lisa, it's Eric. I'll start then maybe invite David to add some additional comments on the end here. But overall, our foundational pharmacy benefit services business, Express Scripts is off to a really good start for 2025. We've got strong new sales and our 2025 retention rate is going to be consistent with three years and the mid-90s or better. Stepping back a little bit, Evernorth overall is -- continues to be well positioned to grow. The specialty business is also positioned for strong growth with significant growth driven by our pharmacy benefits clients electing to use our specialty capabilities as well as strong growth in services sold directly to health systems and other health plans. So overall, we are quite excited about the strength of the solutions and how they continue to resonate with the market overall. The themes or specific programs that I would point to come back to areas that help to make the value of the dollar spent on medicine is more effective, right? So programs like our EnCircleRx program that helps to effectively manage weight loss medication GLP-1 or our most recent oncology benefit offering that David mentioned a bit ago in his prepared remarks. So targeted specific types of programs that work really well with the broader suite of benefit offerings continue to resonate really well in that scenario we continue to invest in. David, do you want to take a bit on the broader environment comment? David Cordani : I appreciate the call out. First and foremost, let me reiterate we're proud of the work we do daily, and I'm greatly appreciative of our team that gets up everyday serving our patients and customers through employer relationships, health plane relationships, governmental entity relationships and increasingly through partnerships and collaborations to health care professionals. Second, we will and need to continue to innovate for the benefit of those we serve, whether that's through the likes of ClearCareRx, our patient insurance program, our EnCircle program, our independent pharmacy program, all of which are first in the space. Now specific to your question, we challenged ourselves to be much more aggressive and complete relative to communication and engagement in support of our clients, be they employers or health buying customers collaborate even more deeply and intensely with the independent pharmacies and subsegmenting the independent pharmacists who are truly independent and rural working on the hill, of course. And then lastly, more aggressively leveraging credible third-party independent analysis of what our industry does and specifically what we do on behalf of those we serve in a fact-based incredible way. So you should expect to see us a bit more complete and aggressive ensuring that we're amplifying that. But make no doubt, we also need to continue to innovate as we have, and we will continue to innovate for the benefit of those we serve. Operator : And this question comes from A.J. Rice , your line is open. You may ask your question from UBS. A.J. Rice: I might just flip over and ask you about the any distinctive you're seeing in the health benefit selling season across your book, and a large group and select, et cetera. And then also, you called out for quite a while now, fatigue on point solutions. I wonder, I understand how you're addressing affordability and understand how you addressing behavioral health integration. But on the point solution question, is there anything that is -- or do you think you'll consider buying some of these point solutions and then offering them as part of your integrated offering? Do you sort of see yourself getting in the middle of helping employers choose between the myriad of point solutions? How are you addressing that? Brian Evanko : A.J., it's Brian. I'll start on the Cigna Healthcare selling season and buying pattern dynamic. And then I think David will pick up on the second part of your question relative to point solutions and some of our inorganic activities. So as it relates to the Cigna Healthcare selling season, I'll concentrate my comments on the larger end of the U.S. employer market just given the time of the year. We're seeing a relatively consistent number of RFPs this year in comparison to last year at this time. And similarly, in terms of our existing clients, we have a similar amount out to bid as we did last year at this time. So, just for some context on the numbers. Now each of these larger employer clients tend to have unique needs. There's a few areas that thematically I'd call out in terms of what our teams are seeing out in the market. One, as David made reference to earlier, affordability continues to be a key area of focus particularly with the wave of drug innovation, including GLP-1s and gene therapy hitting the market. Secondly, to your point, some of the larger employers are seeking to consolidate vendors or point solutions with those who can supply more integrated offerings. Third, we're seeing mental health and substance of these benefits and programs becoming more and more important each year, particularly given some of the downstream effects of the pandemic. And finally, many of these larger clients are interested in digitally enabled care navigation capabilities to drive either further study care optimization or consumer empowerment. So taken all together, our Cigna Healthcare offerings are well positioned to address these themes and demands from large employers. And importantly, we also continue to see strong traction in net growth in our under 500 Select segment as you'll see in the statistical supplement, 7% year-over-year growth in customers within our Cigna Healthcare Select segment specifically. David, maybe you want to pick up on the point solution question? David Cordani : Sure. So first, if you think about some of the solutions we identified both in today's call and in prior conversations, you can think about our digital health formulary, as a way that we connect capabilities and work to connect them seamlessly. You can think about the way the Encircle program is designed. It's designed to have actually coordination and continuity that is patient-centric the oncology program that we will roll out in 2025 is another example of taking specific care need or episode of care and redesigning the pathway to care in a much more coordinated basis, staying focused on the patient and the health care professional. The Cigna Behavioral Group offering that I referenced has much more continuity and coordination of the care experience, starting from the access to the medical professional, the matching and the coordination and there'll be new offerings. You can think about all those as largely having been built organically as we continue to invest back in the organization. To the core question through acquisition, you could think about that as well, you never roll it out largely not fueled through acquisition, although there could be episodic coordination of point solutions. And then I would graph in the middle, I'd remind you that we operate the Cigna Ventures organization where we have a now meaningful track record of partnering with organizations where they are, by definition, almost point solutions and helping collaboratively to co-innovate with them as we go forward. So stepping back, largely organically driven proven track record and the acceleration of new innovations that are coming to market for the benefit of those we serve to meet that demand. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Mok with Barclays. Andrew Mok : With all the changes coming to Part D, there could be significant changes, not only to membership, but also formulary managing for next year. How does the shifting risk to Part D sponsors impact Evernorth more broadly? And how are you helping clients navigate these changes? David Cordani : Andrew, it's David. Let me comment briefly on the PDP macro environment and then ask Eric to walk through our capabilities and our proven track record of supporting our clients relative to their PDP offerings. As you step back, it was clear that the Inflation Reduction Act as it was designed and the ultimate implementation of it was going to cause PDP premiums to rise meaningfully. And most likely, that was going to create some meaningful disruption for seniors. Now as the bids have gone in, CMS has assessed those bids and has drawn apparently some of the similar conclusions relative to the acceleration of the bids and the acceleration of the premiums required given the design features. And after reviewing those has created a short-term window for some bid adjustments that we and like others are going through that on an accelerated basis. So that disruption was designed from the Inflation Reduction Act in the marketplace is reacting to that. Mok Eric to talk more specifically to our capabilities and how we work and supportive in many cases, our health plan clients in their PDP book of business to ensure we deliver great quality and overall affordability. Eric? Eric Palmer : Evernorth and Express Scripts specifically has a long history of supporting health plans to offer Medicare Part D plans. We've got a great track record of a treatment and strong stars outcomes for them and supporting our plans and their offerings and helping them with the tools to manage formularies and model the impacts of changes for example. We're continuing to make investments to help ensure our plans are well positioned with the continued evolution of Part D coverage. We even with the most recent round of changes from the IRA like the administrative requirements associated with the copay smoothing just as one example. This continues to be an important part of the Evernorth and Express Scripts business that we're positioned to continue to help our plans succeed and thrive as they work through these changes. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Scott Fidel : I was hoping to maybe just touch on the marketplace and a couple of things there. One, just with the [Hips] 2023 risk adjustment true-up, if you can tell us what the net impact was to earnings if there was any relative to how you had accrued for that? And then also, just when thinking about the commentary on cost trends. Maybe if you could overlay that into the marketplace in terms of if you're seeing a similar trend there and how that's influencing your view on exchange margins for the full year. I think that prior view had been probably still a bit below long-term target there for marketplace margins this year, just interested in an updated view on margins for the year. Brian Evanko : Scott, it's Brian. Maybe I'll try to just take a big picture view of the individual exchange business in aggregate and hit your risk adjustment question as part of that. So the headline I'd ask you to take away broadly speaking, our individual exchange book is performing as we expected in 2024. As it relates to the final 2023 individual exchange risk-adjusted true-up, we had already been accrued for a sizable risk adjustment payable. And in the second quarter results, we did have a small unfavorable true-up that was recorded in the Cigna Healthcare P&L. But overall, this was not a meaningful performance driver in the second quarter for us. And then as it relates to the 2024 performance year, we did receive our first look at the industry-wide risk adjustment data for the specific states we participate, as we closed up the second quarter books and the preliminary industry data confirmed that our previous 2024 risk adjustment assumptions were reasonable. My earlier commentary on cost trends was broadly applicable to the individual exchange business as well. So when you put all the pieces together, we are tracking toward the improved 2024 margin profile we outlined during our first quarter call. And therefore, we'd expect to land the year slightly below our long-term target margin range of 4% to 6% for the individual exchange business. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Langston with TD Cowen. Ryan Langston : Just looks like the exchange business was down maybe 99,000 to 100,000 members sequentially. I certainly understand why it was down versus '23 year-end, but wasn't exactly expecting that sequential move anything to call out there? And maybe a little early, but I'll ask just any expectations on 2025 in terms of growth trajectory and perhaps even margin profile? Brian Evanko : Ryan, it's Brian. Congratulations on your new role. As it relates to the individual exchange lives intra year, maybe I'll just step back and give you kind of a year-to-date perspective, and then I'll get into the sequential component of your question. So as we discussed during our first quarter results call, the primary driver of the year-to-date change in Cigna Healthcare customer volumes is our individual exchange book. You'll recall that we repositioned this business in 2024, including taking some needed pricing actions in certain geographies in order to improve profitability and we expected to see a reduction in customer volumes as we have witnessed. And sequentially, the individual exchange business drove the majority of the modest decline in the second quarter customer volumes. Now you should think of the primary driver of that being non-payment of premiums as a result of some of the pricing actions we took in a couple of the larger geographies. So it's essentially the delayed effect of those grace periods kicking in. It was an immaterial impact to our financial results in the quarter. Over the course of the balance of this year, we would expect to see continued strong growth within our U.S. employer under 500 Select segment, which should result in sequential growth in U.S. employer and Cigna Healthcare lives for the balance of the year. So taken all together, we're pleased with the overall balance in the Cigna Healthcare portfolio. As it relates to 2025 in the picture there, we've just recently completed all the pricing and rate filings network design. And until we really see all the competitive dynamics, it's hard to know how that will shake through we would expect our margins to be similar or potentially a little bit better next year in the individual exchange book as we look forward. But too early to know exactly how we'll shake out from a membership standpoint. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Josh Raskin : I'd be curious to get your views on the potential for ICRA and specifically how that could impact the small group or select market? And maybe how does stop-loss fit into that equation? Brian Evanko : Josh, it's Brian. I'll take that one as well. So we see the ICRA market in its current form is likely being a niche market, but one that we're monitoring closely. So more specifically, we see the ICRA market as something that could be in a feeling option for smaller employers who tend to be more commoditized buyers. And we expect this is most likely to be an attractive option for employers with less than 50 employees, which is a market segment that is financially immaterial for us today. And within the under 50 market, the average employer there has fewer than 10 employees, so very small employers typically. Now all that said, our individual exchange business represents an opportunity for us to participate in the ICRA space, should it gain more momentum? Again, I didn't know where I started and that we see this most likely being a niche market our stop-loss offerings, to your question, are fully integrated with our Select segment business. So you should not think of that as something that is a net threat to us in the select market provided that the under 50 concentration transpires the way that I described earlier. Operator : Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill : I thought I'd just ask a question on what I consider to be your cost of goods sold line, which is there continues to be a lot of discussion from the retail pharmacy side of the business around trying to negotiate new payment models or changes in terms. I don't know if there's any update that you can provide on how those conversations are progressing? Eric Palmer : George, it's Eric. First, I'm going to comment on any specific negotiations with any pharmacies or things along those lines. But as you know, we've got a wide array of choices and options for our clients. That extends to how we've constructed our network as we look to balance access and affordability that best meets the needs of our clients and their patients. So we work to assemble a range of different network options under a range of different reimbursement types that match up with the needs for cost access and the associated trade-offs and touch there for our clients. So overall, that approach has served us well. We work to continue to innovate to bring new solutions to market. An example of a new solution there would be like late last year, we announced our ClearNetwork Solution. ClearNetwork provides a comprehensive simple solution in that, the pricing is based off of independent, externally created index and then it's got a simple margin that's shared between us and the pharmacy. So it's a new offering we put in the market last year that's generating interest. But again, overall, the portfolio of offerings that we continue to pull together resonates with our buyers and is part of the reason we've continued to grow the pharmacy benefits services, chassis nicely over the last few years. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : This is Adam on for Kevin. So you raised guidance in Q1 on what seems like a smaller beat at least for street expectations, but you didn't raise guidance this quarter. Can you give a little more color on why maybe you wouldn't raise and how things came in versus your expectations? And if there's anything to read into on the PYD or on the -- maybe on DCPs being down. Any color would be helpful. Brian Evanko : Adam, it's Brian. So first off, we're pleased to have delivered another strong quarter of results on both the top and bottom lines with overall results slightly ahead of our expectations in the second quarter. Now within the quarter, we did have some timing-related benefits, including tax items that contributed to the strength in the EPS line, and we're pleased to reaffirm our full year guidance as well as all key supporting metrics considering this dynamic environment. And importantly, both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare are delivering against their respective commitments. Taking into account the environment, we're being prudent with this attractive full year EPS outlook of at least $2.40, representing over 13% growth near the high end of our long-term average annual EPS growth rate range of 10% to 14%. Operator : Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Erin Wright : So you called out the strength across specialty and services at Evernorth. I guess, how do we think about the Humira strategy contributing to the results now? And then how does that influence sort of the quarterly progression across Evernorth in the back half of the year? And just the strategy around Humira, and how that's playing out relative to your expectations? Have you, for instance, in-sourced? Humira similar across your CuraScript business. Does it make sense to in-source more than the 50%, for instance, that you're targeting on that front? David Cordani : It's David. Let me start. You have a lot in your question and appreciate it, given the importance of the space. First, just to reiterate, the Specialty and Care part of the portfolio represents really 30% of our enterprise today. And we're quite excited about the growth potential for that business. We see the product business portfolio as a provision of care business that leverages in many cases, and we're talking about the specialty services. As noted, we had strong growth in the second quarter of 12% and as we discussed for quite some time, the breadth of our capabilities position us well relative to changes in the marketplace, more specifically the biosimilar opportunity. Now you have multiple questions here that I'll ask Eric to peel back a little bit relative to the more specific opportunities we see both in terms of our core business through Accredo as well as through CuraScript as we're expanding our capabilities in our portfolio. Eric? Eric Palmer : Thanks, David. So, just stepping back a little bit again as well. Biosimilars are really important opportunity to improve the affordability of these high-cost specialty medicines. And we're really well positioned to help to connect our clients and their customers with these therapies. Our approach here has been consistent in that we offer choice and value to best align with our clients' needs. And we're focused on getting to low net cost fuel and competition and aligning incentives for everyone involved. The patients, our clients, our plan sponsors and the pharma supply chain. As you've made reference to in your question through Quallent Pharmaceuticals, our private label distributor we contracted with multiple manufacturers for interchangeable biosimilar Humira, and this is available at no cost to patients and attractive cost to plan sponsors began shipping this product at the very end of June. So just a few weeks ago, we've already seen meaningful uptake in the last few weeks, consistent with our expectations. We expect the customer adoption to continue to grow over the balance of the year. And it's early, five weeks in, really or so, but we see biosimilars having about a 20% share of our book at this point after just shipping this product for the last five weeks. I've said to overall continue to see that this is a real opportunity for us to improve the affordability of health care for the benefit of our clients and our plan sponsors. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Stephen Baxter : One of the questions has been asked, but I wanted to ask about in-group membership trends. It does seem we're starting to see more mixed data on the job front. Could you spike out a little bit what you're seeing in the in group trends? And do you think your sequential membership changes are generally a good reflection of that? David Cordani : It's David. As we discussed back in 2023, as the year was unfolding, just by way of context, we were very mindful of the potential for some softening of the employer marketplace. And then to your point, in group trends softening a little bit. And when we state of quite close to monitoring it, it didn't really manifests itself in any material way, given employers we're still working to get to a full level of employment. For 2024, we've taken a similar cautious curious monitoring approach and built a little bit of consideration relative to softening. And by and large, we have not seen that to date. So the membership headlines that we've delivered represent good fundamental strength as Brian noted previously, the change in our membership is largely driven by our as expected, dampening of the marketplace, as you would call it, our individual exchange business. But we remain closely monitoring any dampening tied to the economy and thus far haven't seen anything material to call out there. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. David Windley : Brian, in your comments, I think I heard you say that the excess reserves from 1Q have basically developed in line with your expectations. I think I also heard you say that you didn't see any, say, intra quarter trends or a particular month in the quarter that stood out as an anomaly. And I think in looking at our -- your progression looks like MLR implied for the second half is maybe in the neighborhood of 200 basis points above the first half historical normal, maybe about half of that. So just wanted to understand if the higher MLR expectation for the second half is kind of cautious posture or if you're expecting certain things to accelerate in the second half that would drive that. And maybe a last question would be relative to pricing, would you view yourselves as pricing to forward view of trend as you head into next year? Or would you be pricing to expand margin? Another long question. Brian Evanko : No problem, Dave. So as it relates to the second half MCR guidance, I think your question was in a year-over-year context. Really, three factors that I'd highlight, if you're looking at it relative to the back half of '23, you may recall from our first quarter earnings release, we discussed that the 2024 seasonality would be more similar to pre-pandemic norms with the MCR increasing as the year unfolded, in part driven by our individual exchange business metal tier mix, which is skewed more bronze this year. Additionally, we had some favorable stop loss utilization in the fourth quarter of 2023 that we are anticipating will normalize in 2024 and our year-to-date experience is consistent with that expectation. And then finally, there is one additional business day in the third quarter of this year, which has some elevation in the MCR in the third quarter specifically for that. So all those factors combined to generate a higher second half MCR year-over-year. But again, we remain comfortable and confident with the full year MCR guidance range that we provided here. As it relates to the pricing environment, and I'll comment specifically on our U.S. employer business, as a reminder, this is a book that's nearly 85% ASO or self-funded. So therefore, we have earnings levers that go well beyond a pure risk-based MCR, but that said, our U.S. employer book is currently operating from a position of strength as we've been performing within target margin ranges. And we remain disciplined with our own pricing strategy in the current environment. We continue to price to our best estimate of forward-looking cost trends. To your point, I don't need additional margin recapture at the book level. We are seeing the impact of inflation work its way through our provider contracts. As these contracts renew, we continue to expect elevated levels of utilization through 2024. So when you put all those pieces together, our all-in pricing trend for 2024, slightly higher than what we had assumed a year ago for the corresponding 2023 pricing cycle. And we're confident in our ability to secure appropriate pricing for 2025 and beyond. So a long answer to your long question. Operator : Our next question comes from Jessica Tassan with Piper Sandler. Jessica Tassan : I'm curious how you're thinking about the possibility that Skyrizi and Rinvoq substitutions could maybe foreclose the Humira biosimilar opportunity? And I guess just what recourse do you have to ensure that the biosimilar products that you've got in the market succeed, I think you've given us plenty of evidence that they're the best for the patients. So just yes, how are you thinking about the possibility of foreclosure and what can you do to kind of prevent or mitigate that? Eric Palmer : Jessica, it's Eric. So I guess stepping back, our approach is focused on getting -- offering choice and value and getting to the lowest cost and best available solution from a patient perspective. So a couple of things I would note. First of all, our biosimilar offering is interchangeable. And so that facilitates an easier election if a patient chooses to choose a biosimilar, it's an easier process by being interchangeable, so that would be one thing I would note as a differentiator for us. More broadly, we're here to facilitate and ensure patients have access to the medicines that they need. So if the Skyrizi or Rinvoq will be in a position to fulfill that as well. But overall, we're working to make sure that we've got the right access to all of the medication. As we look ahead, ensuring we've got on a fully developed portfolio of all of the available biosimilar offerings will be important, and we'll continue to be in a position to lead here. Operator : Our last question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Lance Wilkes : Could you just give me a little more color on some of the faster growth areas in Evernorth, in particular, if you could talk a little bit about GLP-1 coverage outlook for -- during the selling season for next year, so fee growth has been really strong. How much of that is coming from traditional PBM versus care services growth? And are you seeing any of that in Accredo? Eric Palmer : It's Eric. So let me start and just talk a little bit about the Encircle and then I'll ask Brian to talk a little bit more about the numerical dimensions of things. So within the Encircle program, we've got over 2 million covered lives at this point. So that's growing nicely. Stepping back a little bit in terms of just looking at the coverage for GLP-1s for weight loss indications overall in the Express Scripts business, we've now got essentially 50% or so of plan sponsors covering for weight loss indications. So we've seen continued incremental growth there. The underlying utilization levels also continue to grow nicely. We've seen growth there, consistent with what you might have seen from an industry growth perspective or things along those lines. David Cordani : Looking ahead, we expect the use of these medications to continue to grow. And that is part of the growth algorithm for Evernorth overall. Stepping away from GLP-1 specifically, we see broader growth opportunity in specialty with continued growth, both through new therapies through biosimilars coming to market as well as us continuing to expand our relationships whether that's through our CuraScript, specialty distributor or through other direct opportunities. So overall, growth across a number of different fronts within Evernorth that we're pleased to be in a position to deliver. Brian, do you want to pick up the second part of Lance's question? Brian Evanko : Sure. So as it relates to the fees and other revenue line in Evernorth, which is up 14% quarter-over-quarter, I think about a number of different areas contributing to the strong performance. contributions from our Evernorth Care businesses are reflected here. So think of EviCore, MDLIVE, our behavioral health business. And then additionally, to the core of your question, we are seeing continued growth in service-based solutions within the pharmacy benefit services business where clients are electing more fee-based orientations with us. So finally, the other contributor to this is the cross enterprise leverage that we're driving with Cigna Healthcare results in revenue from Cigna Healthcare showing up in fees and other revenue in Evernorth and then being eliminated at the corporate level. So all of those contribute to that strong growth in the fees and other revenue line. Operator : Thank you. I will turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : First, let me thank you all for your engagement today, your time and your questions. I just want to highlight a few headline points. With our momentum, we are confident that we will deliver on our EPS outlook of at least $28.40 for 2024, which represents over a 13% growth rate from 2023. Additionally, before we close, I want to recognize and express appreciation to our 70,000 co-workers across the globe. It's their continued focus, dedication and commitment to support our clients, our customers, our patients and our partners that enable us to deliver on our commitments, including those to you, our shareholders. We're proud of what we've achieved, and we're excited about the opportunities that stand as we look ahead. And as always, we look forward to our future discussions. Have a great day. Thanks.

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedure on how to enter the queue to ask question at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the call over to Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, the Cigna Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Evanko, Chief Financial Officer of the Cigna Group and President and Chief Executive Officer of Cigna Healthcare; and Eric Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evernorth Health Services. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including our third quarter financial results and our financial outlook for 2024. Following their prepared remarks, David, Brian and Eric will be available for Q&A. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures, including adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally, accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of the cignagroup.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2024 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over, I will cover a couple items pertaining to our GAAP financial results. In the third quarter, we recorded shareholders' net income of $739 million or $2.63 per share. This is driven by a non-cash, after-tax, net realized investment loss of $1 billion or $3.69 per share related to VillageMD. This includes both the write-down of the remaining carrying value of the asset, as well as the impairment of the dividend, which is recognized as a special item in the quarter. This is excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share in our discussion of financial results. In the third quarter, we also recorded other after-tax net special item charges of $162 million or $0.58 per share. Details of the special items are included in our quarterly financial supplement. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full-year 2024 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share of purchases and anticipated 2024 dividends. With that, I'll turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks Ralph. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining today's call. Today I'll spend a few minutes talking about our strong results in the third quarter and how we're advancing our growth strategy. I'll also provide some initial perspective relative to 2025, including some of the expected tailwinds and headwinds. Then Brian will share more detail about our results and our outlook for the rest of the year and we'll take your questions. So let's get started. Building on a track record of competitively differentiated performance, I'm pleased to report that in the third quarter the Cigna group delivered total revenue of $63.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $7.51. Our results are a testament to the collective depth and strength of our people and commitment, hard work and focus they bring to everything we do. We have deep continuity and the most experienced leadership team in the industry with more than 16-years average tenure across our growth platforms. And we continue to infuse new talent into the company from across many sectors and industries to round out our enterprise perspective. Our third quarter performance demonstrates how we harness the complementary capabilities of our two growth platforms : Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare to drive attractive growth. This quarter Evernorth anchored our results by delivering strong top and bottom line contributions generated by market leading innovation and affordability initiatives, particularly within our specialty and care services portfolio, as well as our pharmacy benefit service business. Evernorth\u2019s strong overall growth reflects the continued demand for our services as we continue investing in broadening our offerings and expanding our reach. Cigna Healthcare was also continuing their momentum in the quarter. U.S. employer business draws on enterprise capabilities to deliver greater affordability and support healthy outcomes for the benefit of our clients and their employees and families. Of note, we are driving continued solid growth in our select customer segment. Our results demonstrate focus execution and momentum during our peak selling season and continued opportunity for growth in the years ahead. Touching on our Medicare Advantage business, we remain on track to close on our sale of our Medicare business to HCSC in the first quarter of 2025. We continue to expect to use the majority of the proceeds for share repurchase. I would note that our Medicare business is performing in line with expectations and we're pleased with the overall value of our offerings, including our nationwide enrollment weighted average will again be four stars for 2025. Going forward, our focus will be on further growing our Evernorth chassis to continue to serve Medicare lives. Overall, our quarterly results reflect clear strategy and strong execution resulting in attractive results. Now stepping back, I want to take a moment to comment on recent headlines and speculation around our company. And while we don't comment on media rumors, we believe that it is important to provide additional context during these unprecedented times. First, there is no question that the industry is highly disrupted. For example, the Medicare Advantage market is particularly challenged given a number of factors, including elevated medical costs, a significant change in SARS ratings for many, and a reset of the risk-adjusted revenue streams. These and other forces are contributing to operational disruption for some as well. As I noted, we don't comment on rumors. But what I will do is be very clear on the actions we are pursuing. We continue to deploy our excess free cash flow for share repurchase, with repurchases totaling $5.7 billion year-to-date, including over $715 million in October. Looking forward, we expect to continue to actively repurchase our shares in the fourth quarter, further leveraging our remaining repurchase capacity, which stands at $5.6 billion. Now I want to transition and cover several actions we are driving in the third quarter and throughout 2024 that address the forces of change that are reshaping the face of healthcare, while we continue to position our company for growth for the benefit of our clients, our customers, and our patients. The first is the pace and rate of pharmacological innovation, and it continues to surge. Many of the treatments coming to market are meaningful in extending and improving quality of lives, for example, through new gene therapies and breakthrough treatments, but they are pressuring affordability given the high list price for manufacturers. Evernorth\u2019s specialty pharmacy business, Accredo, is continuing its strong growth trajectory given both the secular tailwinds and our differentiated strengths, which make us the market leader in the space. The opportunity in biosimilars is a good example of how we are leading the way in providing more value. At the end of June, we began dispensing our interchangeable biosimilar for Humira. And we're pleased that biosimilar penetration was approximately one-third among eligible accredited patients in the quarter. Building on that success, several weeks ago we announced that we will begin offering an interchangeable to Stelara Biosimilar in 2025. Like Humira Biosimilar, it will be available for a $0 out of pocket for eligible Accredo patients, which drives savings for individuals as well as clients. Another example of our leadership is the GLP-1 drug class, which is on pace to be the number one drug trend driver for plants this year. Now, they're expensive with manufacturers' list price of approximately $15,000 a year. Express Scripts, our pharmacy benefit service business, the EnCircle Rx solution provides a clinical program wrapper around the medication to help to support sustainable and positive lifestyle changes for patients, as well as improve affordability and access for clients. I'm pleased to share that in the quarter, EnCircle has already grown to almost 8 million lives now enrolled. The pace of change in the pharmacological industry is also why we continue to proactively address misconceptions and misinformation around the pharmacy benefits industry. This is vital to ensure that patients and individuals continue to maintain access to affordable, high-quality prescriptions. Earlier this month, Dr. Dennis Carlton, Professor of Economics Emeritus from the University of Chicago and former DOJ economists released a comprehensive review of the PVM industry. Dr. Carlton's research was conducted over 16-months and drew from multiple sources, including analysis of approximately 20 billion 30-day equivalent prescriptions. The finding of Dr. Carlton\u2019s research in direct contradiction with the FTC's report concludes that PBMs lower high drug prices by fostering competition among [tribal] (ph) drug manufacturers and pharmacies. PBMs facilitate broader access to generic medications in addition to name brand alternatives, which lower costs. And importantly, PBM support independent pharmacies with higher reimbursement rates than chains. And the number of independent pharmacies is increasing. We will leverage Dr. Carlton's study as we continue to engage in fact-based discussions about these critical issues. Moving to the second rapidly changing trend, the increased need for quality behavioral services, which is in part driven by geopolitical, economic, social dynamic tensions that are unfolding around the globe. For context, in the past five years, we've seen overhaul behavioral therapy utilization nearly double. Now in the same period, we worked to increase services and access, for example, adding almost 270,000 providers to our network, assessing the needs of those with lower complexity issues and offering new coaching programs, and implementing online scheduling and access with appointments guaranteed within 72 hours, which millions of Cigna Healthcare customers can now pursue. This is another example of how our businesses have complementary capabilities as we leverage behavioral health innovations and services from Evernorth and embed them into Cigna Healthcare Solutions. The final trend that I will touch on is technology-enabled innovations. We're only beginning to see the start of profound changes as emerging technologies such as AI-powered diagnostics and treatments will drive vast improvements including more personalized care. Another example is the ongoing adoption of virtual services which is rapidly rising with about 25% of patients accessing care through telehealth services last year in the U.S. This far exceeds the 5% or fewer who accessed care this way prior to the pandemic. We continue to advance in this area with our telehealth platform MDLIVE. We have offered MDLIVE for our customers since its acquisition in 2021. And last month we took another step forward with patients that have lower health risk issues enabling them to get fast, flexible care without a phone call or video call, whenever and wherever they want, with MDLIVE physicians via an online portal. And patients typically are able to receive treatment within one hour. At the Cigna Group, we're built to create and capture value from these forces of change for the benefit of those we serve. Next, I'll transition to provide some context relative to the tailwinds and headwinds we anticipate for 2025. Now we'll provide detailed guidance as we always do during our fourth quarter call. With the strength of our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms, we expect to both finish 2024 strong and for 2025 to have another year of competitively attractive performance. Some notable tailwinds include our continued ramp-up of biosimilar offerings, continued advancement of new client relationships, and EPS accretion from the divestiture of our Medicare business, specifically the impact of share repurchase from the sales proceeds. Now turning to headwinds, we expect lower net investment income as we will no longer recognize the dividend from our VillageMD investment. We anticipate some stranded overhead from the sale of our Medicare Advantage business, which we will mitigate over time. And we will make continued strategic investments across our portfolio to drive sustained innovation and position ourselves for long-term growth. Considering all the puts and takes, we expect another strong year of growth in 2025 with EPS growth of at least 10%, which is consistent with our historical approach when we start the year with appropriate prudence. Now I'll briefly summarize our performance for the quarter. Building on our momentum, our focus in discipline third-quarter execution positions us to meet our full-year 2024 and long-term growth targets. The Cigna group has earned a reputation for delivering differentiated value for those we serve and driving new innovation in ways that lead the industry. Our ability to consistently do this year-after-year is directly attributable to the strength of our leadership team and the passion and commitment of our 70,000 colleagues worldwide. And the deliberate structure of our company, which is designed with growth platforms capable of navigating even the most dynamic environments. As a result, in the third quarter, we delivered on our financial commitments with adjusted EPS of $7.51, and we remain on track to deliver full-year adjusted earnings per share of at least $20.40 in 2024. Our company has attractive and sustainable growth opportunities over the long-term and we remain confident in delivering our continued average annual EPS growth rate of 10% to 14% on average, building on our track record of achieving 13% adjusted EPS on a compound growth rate over the past decade. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian to share additional perspective on our performance for the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Brian Evanko : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today I'll review Cigna's third quarter 2024 results and discuss our outlook for the full-year. During the year where the environment has been highly disrupted and dynamic, we're pleased with another quarter of strong results, highlighting our consistent execution and delivering against our prior commitments. Key consolidated financial highlights for the third quarter include revenue of $63.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $7.51. These results, combined with our breadth of capabilities in diverse portfolio businesses, reinforce our confidence in our full-year 2024 adjusted earnings per share outlook of at least $28.40, representing more than 13% year-over-year growth. Now turning to our segment results, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Evernorth continues to deliver strong results driven by consistent execution across our businesses with particularly significant growth within our specialty and care services business in the third quarter. Total Evernorth revenues for third quarter 2024 grew to $52.5 billion and pre-tax adjusted earnings grew 9% to $1.9 billion, slightly ahead of expectations. This growth came despite a $33 million headwind to net investment income related to the absence of the VillageMD dividend. Our strong Evernorth results reflect our continued execution amidst the ongoing long-term trend of pharmacological innovation. With rising clinical needs, the introduction of new therapies to the market, and more availability of biosimilars, Evernorth is well positioned to assist patients and clients in navigating these trends. Moving to our businesses within Evernorth, specialty and care services revenue of $23.8 billion and adjusted earnings of $825 million both grew 23% in the quarter, a significant acceleration in year-over-year growth when compared to the first-half of 2024. While we had expected strong contributions in the quarter, this performance was above expectations, reflecting growth across our specialty businesses driven by more rapid uptake of specialty medications. Additionally, the quarter also benefited from increased adoption of Humira biosimilars. The increased adoption benefits both patients through lower out-of-pocket costs, as well as clients through lower net costs. And in the quarter, we saw approximately one-third of eligible Humira scripts transition to biosimilars. As we have highlighted, we are the leader in the specialty market. We are confident in delivering long-term profitable growth, given the pipeline of new drug innovation and our decades of experience in the space, as we've established a differentiated business model with proven, superior clinical outcomes for complex, high-cost conditions. Pharmacy benefit services also posted robust revenue growth driven by the addition of new business wins, expansion of existing relationships, and continued demand for new drugs through our innovative products and solutions. Pre-tax adjusted earnings increased to $1 billion as our differentiated capabilities continue to drive affordability and value to our patients, customers, and clients. Overall, Evernorth delivered results slightly above expectations, even while absorbing the aforementioned net investment income headwind. And we continue to expect accelerating growth in the fourth quarter. Regarding Cigna Healthcare, third quarter 2024 revenues were $13.3 billion. Pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.2 billion and the medical care ratio was 82.8%. The medical care ratio was in line with expectations. As we have discussed, we planned and priced for elevated trend coming into the year. During the quarter, we did observe elevated trends in specialty medications in our Cigna Healthcare book. This is consistent with the higher volumes we saw in our specialty and care business within Evernorth and speaks to the balance of our well-diversified portfolio, which we intentionally created to position our company for some of the highest growth secular tailwinds in healthcare. Overall, Cigna Healthcare delivered solid results this quarter, demonstrating consistent, steady execution in a dynamic environment. Now turning to our outlook for full-year 2024. Given the strength and diversity of our portfolio, we have the confidence to reaffirm our full-year 2024 expectation for consolidated adjusted earnings per share of at least $28.40. Moving to our 2024 outlook for each of our growth platforms, in Evernorth we continue to expect full-year 2024 pre-tax adjusted earnings of at least $7 billion. This reflects a continued acceleration of earnings in the fourth quarter, driven by strength and specialty volumes and increasing adoption of Humira biosimilars, as well as the continued advancement of new client relationships. This is partially offset by lower expected net investment income. For Cigna Healthcare, we continue to expect full-year 2024 pre-tax adjusted earnings of at least $4.775 billion. And we are maintaining our full-year medical care ratio outlook of 81.7% to 82.5%, although we now expect to be toward the high-end of the range due to the aforementioned increase in specialty medication utilization, which we expect to continue through the fourth quarter. We expect the impact of the higher fourth quarter MCR to be offset by other levers within Cigna Healthcare, such as operating efficiency. Turning to our 2024 capital management position, we remain confident in our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation due to our efficient asset-like strategy that delivers attractive returns on capital. I would note that timing-related items impacted third quarter cash flow from operations. We are anticipating a meaningful step up in cash flow in the fourth quarter, and our capital deployment priorities remain consistent with our long-term framework. Regarding share repurchase, year-to-date through October 30, 2024, we have repurchased approximately 16.9 million shares of our common stock for approximately $5.7 billion, including our repurchase of $715 million in the month of October alone. We continue to expect additional share repurchase in the fourth quarter, demonstrating our confidence in the strength and sustainable growth of our business. Now to recap, strong results through the first three quarters of the year give us confidence to deliver on our full-year 2024 adjusted earnings per share outlook of at least $28.40, representing over 13% year-over-year growth toward the higher end of our long-term average adjusted EPS growth target range. As David mentioned, we look forward to providing our 2025 outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call. We are confident in delivering another year of competitively differentiated EPS growth of at least 10%, consistent with our historical approach where we start the year with appropriate prudence. The ability to consistently meet our financial commitments is a testament to our team executing to drive value for our clients and customers and our portfolio of complementary businesses that we've strategically positioned for strong, stable, and sustainable long-term growth. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of AJ Rice with UBS. Your line is open. AJ Rice : Thanks, hi everybody. Maybe I'll just ask about two things here. One, you obviously had a little bit of an elevated commercial trend this year, but you said all year long that you were able to price for it and anticipate it? I wonder at this early date as you look out to \u201825, are you assuming more of the same? Are you getting any pushback from employers on taking that approach if you are, again? And then on the VillageMD, I know you'd laid out a strategy for working with them as one of the ways that Evernorth could address the primary care market. Obviously, that situation's in flux. I wonder if there's any pivots the company's considering and how important putting something in place with respect to physician groups, particularly primary care, it is for the overall Evernorth strategy. David Cordani : Good morning, AJ, it's David. Let me ask Brian to take your first question relative to trend \u201824 and \u201825, and then I'll provide a little call around Village and specifically our value-based care strategy and where we go from here. Brian? Brian Evanko : Good morning, AJ. So first off, we're very pleased with the strength of our U.S. employer business within Cigna Healthcare. That business continues to perform well for us. And as a reminder, our U.S. employer book is nearly 85% ASO or self-funded, which includes earning levers that go well beyond the peer risk-based MCR. That said, our U.S. employer book is currently operating from a position of strength as we've been performing within our target margin ranges here in 2024. As it relates to the external market to your point on employers, we characterize the environment as competitive but rational, and we've remained disciplined with our own pricing strategy in this environment. As it relates to 2025, we do expect cost trends to remain elevated above historical levels, and we're pricing for 2025 rate increases that are greater than what we achieved in 2024, given that continued elevated cost trend expectation, the firm competitive environment, as well as our desire to preserve our margin levels. So David, I'll turn it over to you to talk about the Village piece. David Cordani : Sure. AJ, so relative to Village, you brought up part of your question, talks about the strategy. So stepping back first and foremost, VBC, Value-Based Care, from our point of view is how do we align incentives, leverage information, and then leverage clinical resources and extenders to deliver improved overall quality and ultimately value. Within our Cigna Healthcare platform, that's done day in, day out for collaborative accountable care relationships, and those relationships continue to evolve. Those are partnered relationships, leverage relationships that we drive forward. Increasingly, some of Evernorth's capabilities are in support of that. Second, specific to the VillageMD relationship, we sought to accelerate that through our Evernorth Accountable Care relationship for lives and patients outside of those that were within our program and chassis on the benefit side of the equation. And in hindsight, the timing of that, given the disruptions at the marketplace, including the risk-adjusted disruption and some of the cash flow disruption from some of the underlying investors proved to be poorly timed. Moving forward from an Evernorth standpoint, the Evernorth Accountable Care relationships will continue to probe and identify where and how we can expand relationships. I would note that we do continue to make very good progress of deepening relationships with healthcare professionals out of Evernorth, specifically off of our CuraScript capabilities that could use to grow meaningfully. But we will continue to take a paced path with the Evernorth Accountable Care relationships currently given the disruption, again, meaningfully caused by the change in the risk adjuster environment. Thanks, AJ. AJ Rice : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. First, I want to follow-up on, David, your comments around capital deployment and some of the rumors out there in the market. Just to be clear, do you, you talked a lot about the share repurchase in 2024, which has been significant. The fourth quarter, the proceeds, are you -- the last time we had this discussion, you also talked about a forward year and where you kind of saw the predominance of capital going as well. Are you also saying -- or did I miss that you were going to talk about that you are going to deploy capital to share repurchase or the vast majority of the share repurchase in 2025 as well? And then just on the business, can you give us some more color on what's going on in Specialty? There have been a few companies talking about that. What do you think is driving that? And any other specifics you can give us, we'd appreciate. David Cordani : Justin, good morning, it's David. Let me take your first question, and then I'll ask Eric to give you, I think your broader second question is relative to what's transpired in the Specialty space. So first, to the specific part of your question, you didn't miss anything I communicated. We've not provided detailed guidance for 2025. We'll provide more comprehensive guidance as we always do on our fourth quarter call and we look forward to doing so. Second, stepping back, as I noted in my prepared remarks, given the disruption in the space, we wanted to ensure that we had as much information out there and the clarity of put forth. I'd ask maybe to step back and reflect for a moment. If you think about to the core of your question, what we've done, our actions that both Brian and I reinforced meaningful share repurchase in 2024, which has been on a repurchasing through the month of October and expect it to continue to repurchase in the fourth quarter. If you reflect back on the last four years, we've repurchased about $24 billion of our stock, right? That was strategically guided as we were harnessing the benefit of the combination. We did have some divestitures within the context of that and as we leverage the broad cash flow generation of our asset-light portfolio and capabilities. So I would ask you to stay tuned for more comprehensive 2025 guidance, but reflect on our disciplined track record of being a good steward of capital and demonstrating the ability to create real sustained shareholder value in the way we deploy capital. Eric, I'll ask you to talk about the Specialty space. Eric Palmer : Great. Thanks, David. And good morning, Justin, it's Eric. As we find at our Investor Day earlier this year, the Specialty market is a $400 billion market and growing. And we're leaders in this space, driven by our focused condition-specific model, our clinical expertise and our overall geographic reach. And this positions us well to be helpful to our clients across the board, whether it's health plans, employers, health systems and the like. Now specific to this quarter, this was the first full quarter where we dispensed our biosimilar Humira. And additionally, we had some expansion with existing clients choosing to move more business to Accredo. And we had broad-based volume strength as well. And I'd call out therapies for inflammatory conditions, for oncology and neurology as areas with particularly strong growth in the quarter. With respect to the 23% growth in the quarter, we've noted in the past that the results in any given quarter is going to depend on the timing of new volumes, new customers, new therapies being available and so on. But over time, we expect this market to be a meaningful part of the growth of our enterprise. We've talked about our Specialty and Care Solutions space growing at 8% to 12% on a sustained annual basis. And all of these factors are built into our assessment there. So we continue to be well positioned in this market and quite excited about the opportunities to serve the market to grow and to serve our patients. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Langston with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Ryan Langston : Hi, thank you. I think in the prepared remarks, you said you had 8 million lives now on the EnCircleRx program. My understanding is that was only -- I say only about 3 million to 5 million only just a couple of months ago. That seems like incredibly strong growth and demand. I guess, what's driving that? And I guess, where do we see that pick up moving over the next couple of years, just given it seems in the past couple of months, that's risen pretty dramatically? Eric Palmer : Good morning, Ryan, it's Eric. Thanks the question. As you can imagine, there's real interest in need from our clients is they're looking for help with managing the affordability of GLP-1s and these conditions overall. We're really excited about the opportunity to bring this first of its kind solution to the market. And as David noted, I think you said we're almost at 8 million lives. So not quite there yet, but approaching it rapidly. We launched this program just a handful of months ago. And as we've talked about previously, it targets the right patient population, working to bring the relevant clinical markers and engage patients with the support they need to help make changes that make the impact last, provides a guaranteed clinical comes to our clients and provides a strong overall return for the investment in the program. Performance so far is that the solution is working well. The early results, our clients are enrolled. They're seeing significant savings and reductions in trends compared to those who are not enrolled as we mature the process or mature the data, we'll have more to report here. David, maybe any other perspective you want to share? David Cordani : Sure. Thanks. I'll just amplify two points. As we all spend a significant amount of time in the market, we're a field-based organization. This is typically a top one, two or three topic with clients, with brokers, with consultants and with others in the market. So as we noted, GLP-1s remain front and center. The specific piece I would add, though, is as the market continues to absorb the challenges of affordability, the market also is observing and clients are observing and physicians are observing the start and stop dynamic that is transpiring for some patients, which also doesn't generate the desired or intended outcome if a patient starts on a regimen and stops in eight months and then maybe starts up and then maybe stops as well. So folks are really -- the value proposition really resonates relative to the clinical wrappers, the care wrappers, the coaching wrappers, the behavioral support wrappers that exist in the value-based care nature of the underlying program. So I appreciate you calling out the growth because it is significant and it underscores the need for innovation that we lead as these new treatments come to market. Ryan Langston : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good morning. Can you maybe talk about the 2025 selling season on the PBM side? I'm just really curious around a few things. One, as we have more biosimilars, are we seeing a change in the economics of how contracts are formulated going into 2025? And then just as a follow-up, David, you highlighted the FTC report and the report that the University of Chicago professors looked at. Is there any update on potential legislation or anything you're seeing from a state perspective that potentially is using some of this information when they're thinking about legislation? David Cordani : Lisa, it's David. Let me ask Eric to start with the Evernorth selling season, including the PBM dynamic and what's transpiring and then I'll address your FTC question. Eric Palmer : Thanks, David. Lisa, fundamentally, we start with a portfolio that's equipped to offer choice and flexibility in how we work to support our clients. We work to make the pharmacy benefit accessible for the patient and more affordable, and we continue to innovate to bring new ways to the market to do that. And stepping back, Evernorth is well positioned to continue to grow. The strength of those innovations and our solutions continue to resonate. And just as we talked about the growth EnCircleRx, we continue to have growth in our various innovative programs. Now specifically with respect to the pharmacy benefit services business for 2025, we had a good 2025 selling season, and our retention rate continues to be consistent with recent years in the mid- to high-90s percent range. We're driving meaningful innovations, whether it's EnCircleRx, our oncology benefit services are just recent examples. And we're positioned for another good year in 2025. As far as change, again, I'd say there's good interest in discussing what services, what financing arrangements are going to best align with our clients' needs, but I wouldn't call out any wholesale or substantial change in terms of what our customers and clients are actually purchasing from us. David? David Cordani : This is relative to the FTC, I think the end of your question really pointed toward legislation, but let me just pull back for a moment. First and foremost, and you know the space extremely well, right? PBM and pharmacy benefit service industry exists to create real, sustained differentiated value through improved affordability, through expanding access to services that are more affordable like generics, through patient coordination and clinical coordination programs, which are especially critical for the chronic and polychronic population. And as a validation of the value we deliver, our client retention levels reinforce that with historic client retention levels in the 95% plus range. And as we look to the year ahead in 2025, it being even at the higher end of that range. And secondly, as we've talked about, whether it's through EnCircleRx, through the biosimilars, our ability to continue to lead the market with innovations that deliver more value especially with new treatments coming to market is mission-critical. Specific to the FTC report, let me be really clear. We disagree on the unfounded assertions that were put forth. Second, the clear direction that was put forth by Dr. Carlton's report is in direct contrast to that. And going forward, we will engage in fact-based conversations. As it relates specifically to legislation, we do not see any specific fully mature proposed legislation right now that looks like it will be put forward. Obviously, there's a bit more time left in the year. There's no doubt relative to that. We remain actively engaged. I was in Washington on Monday of this week on a variety of topics. We remain actively engaged. But I think most importantly, at capping it off, we're confident in the durability of our model, our proven ability to partner, our proven ability to drive ongoing innovation to make sure we are able to continue to grow and deliver the value, both in the pharmacy benefit service space as well as in the specialty space. Lisa Gill : Great. Thanks for the comments, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Mok with Barclays. Your line is open. Andrew Mok : Hi. Good morning. You called out planned investments across both core PBM and specialty in the release, and it sounds like that will continue into 2025. Can you give us a little bit more detail on the nature and magnitude of those investments? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Andrew, it's Brian. So as we intend to do in any year, we have a fair amount of our discretionary capital that goes back into internal reinvestments. So when we talk about the continued investment in the business, not just in the Evernorth platform, but also in Cigna Healthcare, that's a core part of our capital deployment framework before we start talking about capital being returned to shareholders. So this year, we're tracking to, call it, $1.5 billion or so of discretionary CapEx, and that's kind of over and above the core administrative expenses, which are round numbers about $20 billion that we spend in the year. So most of that will go toward technology going forward, so that some of that customer patient-facing technology. Some of that is provider-facing technology, and some of that is a broker or field-facing technology as well. So the majority of when you think about our discretionary CapEx is headed in that direction. And as we think about the long-term growth opportunity we have, for example, in the specialty space, which is already a $400 billion addressable market growing at the secular high-single-digit type rate. We see opportunities to continue strengthening our capabilities there to make ourselves even more relevant. So think of it as primarily technology, and we gear that up or down in any given year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Erin Wright : Thanks so much. I wanted to dig into specialty a bit more. It just sounds like you're seeing the traction with the Humira biosimilar strategy. Just how would you compare that to the strategy around products like Stelara and the ramp you expect with Stelara relative to what you saw with Humira and other biosimilars that are coming down the pipe? I guess, how do you think about the cadence of that opportunity over the next several years but also just in terms of 2025 from an LOE perspective? Thanks. Eric Palmer : Hi, Erin, it's Eric. I appreciate the question. Stepping back, I think the model that we've built here and that we've deployed around our biosimilar Humira has provided another good choice in the market, and it's one that we think we're well positioned to replicate in the appropriate situations going forward. As David mentioned in his prepared remarks, we will be launching a no out-of-pocket cost alternative to Stelara in 2025. And I could envision us using this playbook and approach for additional biosimilars as we look ahead into the coming years. We've noted at our Investor Day earlier this year that we see nearly half of the specialty market having biosimilar alternatives choice available in terms of bringing new affordability to the market. And this is one example of a strategy that will help to improve the affordability and the accessibility of these medicines for the patients that need them and for the plan sponsors that are funding them. So every different therapy will have a different alternatives, they will have different kind of adoption of paths based off of the clinical needs of the patients being served based off of the break and pace of availability of products and such. But at a macro level, we're really well positioned to continue to lead in this market and bring new solutions to market just like we did with the biosimilar Humira, like we are in the process of doing with Stelara and like we'll do with other drugs coming after that. David? David Cordani : Erin, just one point I want to add to Eric's comment relative to the specialty market specifically, and maybe it's a statement of the obvious, but when we operate in an environment of elevated medical cost pressure which the industry is seeing in a broader sense, you could also think about the high-performing nature in this case, of our specialty capabilities, both through Accredo as well as through CuraScript, in some ways, provides us a natural or structured hedge against the medical cost pressure that is natural to manifest itself on the benefit side of the equation. So when we talk about the conscious way, we've structured the corporation, we've structured it, obviously, with different addressable markets. We've structured it with an asset-light framework. But in this case, also highlighting the structure provides some natural hedge when inflationary pressure or utilization pressure manifests on one side, it also provides growth opportunity and value capture opportunities on the other side of our very diverse portfolio. So I just wanted to punctuate that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Question if I could try to do a two-part or would be one, just on the cost trend side, maybe if you could just drill in a little bit, give us an update on the inpatient side as well in terms of what you've been seeing there relative to expectations recently. And then I did want to get your perspective just on the competitive environment for the exchanges in 2025. It looks like from our analysis of the CMS landscape data for the federal exchange is that we do see a number of the major carriers with actually negative rates in their same-store plans for 2025. So it does seem like the competitive framework has intensified quite a bit. And so I'm certainly interested in your perspective right now on that market category as well? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Scott, it's Brian. I'll take both of your questions here. So first off, we're pleased to have delivered another solid quarter of MCR performance within Cigna Healthcare with the overall performance in line with expectations, as I noted earlier. And just as a reminder, we had planned and price for the overall elevated utilization levels that began in 2023 to continue throughout 2024. And within the quarter specifically, we had a range of affordability initiatives that proved to be beneficial to the MCR, and it had some offset to the uptick I mentioned in specialty drug utilization in the quarter. And where we saw that most notably was, we saw some deceleration in cost trends in surgical activity in particular. You asked about inpatient. Inpatient was broadly in line with our expectations in the quarter. So I wouldn't flag that as a particular hotspot or an area of favorability. And as David said, we're fortunate to have the natural hedge at the enterprise level where the elevated customer demand for specialty drugs resulted in the favorable performance, we saw in our Evernorth business, specifically within the specialty and care services platform. As it relates to the individual exchanges, so we continue to see this market as being an important subsegment of the U.S. health care system for those who don't have access to employer or government-sponsored coverages. We've been a consistent player in this market over the past decade since the ACA went into effect. And for us, 2024 has been a year focused on margin expansion in our individual exchange business. And that approach is playing out largely as we expected here with fewer customers in 2024, but carrying a higher profit margin profile compared to our 2023 experience. As it relates to 2025, specifically, as you noted, the weighted average rate increase for our customer base is in the low double digits, which based on the publicly available information is on the higher end of the competitive set. That said, there's a considerable variation by geography when you dig into that. And for us, the exact margin profile and customer volumes will be a function of geographic mix and competitor behavior in each of those different geographies. But taken all together, we continue to invest in this business, see it as a growth engine for the company and over time, look forward to 10% to 15% annualized growth here. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Ron with Bank of America. Your line is open. Adam Ron : Hey, thanks for the question. I also wanted to dig into the specialty comments. But from the managed care side, you mentioned that it was the reason that you're increasing your MLR guidance. And I know that you still do currently own the Medicare Advantage company. That also has the Part D business. And so wondering if you could delineate like the pressure that you're seeing in specialty between the Medicare side and the commercial side. And on the Medicare side, if you think it's being driven by the IRA at all? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Adam, it's Brian. I'll start. If you my colleagues want to pile on, you're welcome to. So as it relates to what we saw in Cigna Healthcare on the Specialty drug side, really, the uptick in the utilization was broad-based across most of our Accredo therapeutic resource centers in the third quarter. In particular, we saw it in inflammatory conditions, oncology and neurology. And really this transpired across all the Cigna Healthcare product lines, Commercial Employer, Medicare and the individual exchanges. The Medicare volumes were slightly more elevated than commercial, but not enough that we would flag it as having a different root cause, and we do not see the IRA is having driven a meaningful amount of the third quarter experience. And as I said earlier, I'm pleased to have the natural hedge with the Evernorth Specialty business benefiting from those increased volumes in the quarter. David Cordani : And Brian, the only thing I would add is, Adam, to your broader question, as noted in our opening comments, but by and large, the Medicare Advantage portfolio of our business is performing in line with our expectations as we build the plan out for the course of the year. So Brian's reference is on the margin in terms of the elevation there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. George Hill : Yes, good morning, guys. And David, I kind of want to come back to the -- your comments on the Medicare Advantage market that you opened up the call with, which is in the past, you kind of said that MA is a strategically important market with a lot of long-term value. And on this call, you're saying it's a challenged market. So first, I guess, number one is kind of can you help me bridge the gap between those two lines of thoughts? And then as you look at the MA market from where you sit, given that you guys still participate, do you see its challenges as cyclical or structural? David Cordani : George, my comments relative to the marketplace are our view, a statement of fact, given the current environment, drawing back to your broader point of view, we see from a societal standpoint, MA as currently and in the future, an important part of the offering to the marketplace. So it would be very clear. Secondly, as we've discussed before, within our Evernorth portfolio today, fully approaching one-third of all of our product programs and services face off against government-sponsored programs, very inclusive of MA and the supporting programs are on MA and we will continue to invest in and grow those programs, products and services. What I was seeking to draw back to was, again, given the disruption in the marketplace and the headline that we were drawn into great clarity that the marketplace is disrupted and our actions and our behaviors are consistent with what we said they were going to be specifically using our discretionary free cash flow for share repurchase. Looking forward, I would expect to see the MA marketplace find its footing again, albeit it's going to go through a choppy phase right now for the forces I talked about before, elevated medical costs. Significant reset the stars. So if you look back, there was a time when the marketplace had almost 90% of all lives in four-star plus plans that gets reset down to 60% plus of lives. That's a large resetting for the marketplace. The risk adjuster part of the program coming through is also quite meaningful. So I deem it to be transitional for the marketplace. The leaders in the marketplace will find a way to lead through this. And importantly, MA serves a very important value prop from a societal standpoint. On average, an MA life as lower income on average in MA life is supportive of better clinical coordination, clinical efficacy and an average in MA life is getting better overall value and affordability. The space is just going through a choppy time right now, and that's what we're trying to call attention to. George Hill : I appreciate the color, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Josh Raskin : Thanks. So I'll harp on those. I'll sort of keep on the topic here. But just in terms of the cadence of buybacks, I want to understand you guys were relatively strong in the first quarter, particularly strong in the second quarter. A noticeable pause in 3Q, and I heard David, your response to Justin's question around this disruption in the space and wanting to get as much clarity as possible. Should we assume that you now have the clarity that you need to understand the Medicare Advantage business and that is what's leading to this reacceleration in the buybacks and into 2025? And then just a smaller one, just on favorable development, it was a little larger in 3Q. Could you talk were there any specific drivers of that or areas where development came in better? David Cordani : Josh, good morning, it's David. Let me take your first question and then ask Brian to take the second part of your questions. No. If the specific answer to your question, the call -- the cadence of our buybacks is driven by cash flow timing. So you'll note that our cash flow, and we've highlighted this in the past, doesn't happen ratably throughout the course of the year. So early part of the year, we expected to have significant deployment of capital and toward the latter part of the year, we expect to have significant deployment of capital. So specific to your question, the timing and cadence of deployment of free cash flow is tied to the timing of the cash flow generation in the fourth quarter will be a high cash flow generation quarter for us. And we highlighted the fact that we are quite active in the marketplace, noting the share repurchase through the month of October thus far. Brian, can I ask you to take the second part of the question? Brian Evanko : Sure, David. So as it relates to the prior year development that we saw in the third quarter, it was a little bit higher than we typically would see in the third quarter. But Important to keep in mind that, that's gross prior year development, which doesn't translate one for one to a net P&L impact, just given the variety of factors like client sharing, MLR rebate impacts and other items. And in any given period, we tend to see a fluctuation as you can appreciate, in reserve development from year-to-year, quarter-to-quarter. And overall, the net P&L effect of prior period reserve development was not a significant driver of the Cigna Healthcare MCO or the Cigna Healthcare income in the third quarter. So I appreciate the questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Your line is open. Lance, your line is open. You may need to unmute yourself. Lance Wilkes : Thanks so much. Just a couple of cleanup questions and one broad strategic question. On the strategic level, as you're looking at deployment of capital as you're thinking about inorganic moves, how do you look at things from a management and board level with respect to management stability, stability and volatility of a business model, et cetera? And are there other important criteria\u2019s we should be aware of? And the little items are just over in the employer market, given high premium inflation, are you seeing different behaviors from employers whether that's faster shift to ASO or certain types of cost containment features that they're looking for? Thanks. David Cordani : Lance, good morning, it's David. Let me take your strategic question specific to M&A criteria and then ask Brian to take your follow-up. You painted a mis-cleanup. I find that interesting. But specific to your strategic question, if you step back and think about our M&A criteria, which is the core of your question, our criteria has not changed. And to remind you, first is strategic alignment. Then second is financial attractiveness. I'll come back to that in a moment. And then third is our need to see a clear path to close. As it relates to financial attractiveness, we take into consideration EPS accretion. So the level of, the timing of, the visibility of, the durability of. We also look at capital efficiency, return on invested capital on a relative basis in terms of assessing it. So to the core of your question, if I heard you correctly, a more disruptive environment or a less stable asset would increase the beta. Increasing the beta requires a higher visibility to highly durable synergies, value capture and the durability of that. So to the core of your question is, of course, we have to consider that because you're looking for strategic value creation and strategic value capture. And adjacency versus further adjacency and the more stable and predictable versus the more volatile has to be taken into consideration. And I'll end with, I believe we have a very clear, good track record of applying these criteria and creating shareholder value over a long period of time. Brian, I'll transition you? Brian Evanko : Yes. Lance, on the second question in terms of how employers are reacting to a higher cost trend environment, a few things highlight there from our U.S. employer portfolio. Affordability is generally the number one topic when we talk to employer clients. And historically, they look at benefit buy-downs, changes to deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums maybe premium contribution changes. But the strategies are becoming more precise and more granular now. So as an example, we're seeing more and more interest in our specialty pharmacy capabilities, programs like the EnCircleRx to help mitigate GLP-1 spending and ensure clinical appropriateness of all those programs. So we're seeing interest in more precise affordability programs. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our mental health and substance of these capabilities. Since the pandemic started, this has been a higher cost trend category. And even this year, it's contributing about 1% to employer cost trends just in the year. So there's interest in what programs and services we have available to address that as well as the link between mental and physical health, which has been shown, metal health utilization deflects physical health needs down the line. And then finally, there's interest in more precise provider network configurations that help to optimize cost, quality incentive alignment. So things like our Pathwell Specialty offerings, things like our Pathway Bone & Joint program, so all those things are of increased interest to employers in a high trend environment. And taken all together, our Cigna Healthcare offerings are well positioned to address those themes. Lance Wilkes : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Michael Ha with Baird. Your line is open. Michael Ha : Hi, thank you. So firstly, on '25 headwinds and tailwinds, thank you for providing that list in your prepared remarks. I was just wondering if you could maybe flesh that out a bit more specifically, which of those building blocks perhaps are you most confident about in terms of helping you on your path to 10% or at least 10% EPS growth next year? And then following up on Erin's question, maybe a different approach to it. I know biosimilar quickly rose to 20% share of your specialty book last quarter. Where has that trended in third quarter? Where do you see both HUMIRA biosimilar adoption, which I believe is now one-third of eligible and that biosimilars share, especially by trending into year-end and over the next year. And then as I think about Evernorth's earnings growth, I think you mentioned last quarter that biosimilars is going to help drive it to high single-digit growth in third quarter, which you did. So I wanted to get your thoughts on how are we now in a spot where it can sustainably grow high single digits going forward, are we officially now in that sort of new paradigm of earnings contribution Evernorth from biosimilars? Thank you. David Cordani : Michael, good morning, it's David. You packed a lot in there for us to begin to bring our call to a close in short order, but important topics. So first, let me just frame a little bit of the headwind tailwind framework and then ask Brian to peel it back, although it will give you a bit more specificity. And then we'll transition to Eric, who will talk about the trends in direction, et cetera. I don't think we're declaring a new normal as opposed to the growth trajectory we see relative to that business in the 8% to 12% compounded over time, which is above the secular trends. But let me shift back to the headwind tailwind. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we'll provide much more detail in our fourth quarter call as we provide the 2025 outlook and guidance as we always do. Importantly, and we want to stress, this will come off of 2024, which is going to be another strong year and competitively differentiated year. And our outlook for 2025 will be a strong year and competitively differentiated year. And we highlighted several of the headwinds and tailwinds as you put them all together, even at this point, we're confident to step forward and say that our growth algorithm will be intact for 2025, yet we would expect to guide at the lower end of our algorithm range with taking a posture prudence. So Brian, could I ask you to give a little bit more color on some of the drivers within the headwinds and tailwinds and some dimensioning? Brian Evanko : Sure, David. Michael, I'll give you maybe a little bit more detail on the three tailwinds and three headwinds that David outlined earlier on the call. So in terms of the three tailwinds we see for 2025, continued biosimilar adoption is one. Obviously, that's been a theme throughout the morning here, and we do have a high degree of confidence in that being delivered in 2025. Secondly, we expect advancements in our large PBS client relationships. Obviously, we had a very sizable new client in '24. We also have others that we've onboard in recent years. And then the third tailwind is EPS accretion from the deployment of the Medicare sale proceeds. And given we know the magnitude of this, we would expect this to be a low single-digit percent impact on 2025 EPS when you think about the deployment of those proceeds. That's offset by three primary headwinds that we see at this juncture. The first is the absence of the 2025 VillageMD dividend recognition. So as I made reference to earlier, that was $33 million in the third quarter. You annualize that out. It's about $130 million of a headwind for 2025 to the Evernorth segment income as well as, obviously, the enterprise. Secondly, we'll have some stranded overhead from the Medicare divestiture, which is currently at about $150 million for the year. And you can think of that as split roughly half and half between Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth. And obviously, our teams will work to whittle that down over time, but we see that as about $150 million headwind for '25. And then finally, continued investments for long-term growth, as I made reference to an earlier question, that will gear up or gear down depending on the market opportunities that we see as we balance short-term and long-term needs for the company. So Eric, you can pile on here on the biosimilars part of the question? Eric Palmer : Thanks, Brian, and thanks for the question, Michael. With respect to HUMIRA, a couple of notes I wanted just to be clear on, we began to spend in a biosimilar HUMIRA at the end of June. We noted in our second quarter call that throughout the month of July, had achieved about 20% -- or about 20% of our customers had elected to use the biosimilar HUMIRA. And that's grown throughout the quarter. The number we provided today was that across the third quarter in its entirety now about 33% of the eligible patients had adopted. So really nice growth throughout the quarter. We would expect that to continue to grow over the balance of the year. And to your more macro question, just I'll step back for a minute. We're well positioned to bring value to the benefit of our customers and clients overall. And as we've noted for several years now, we see and have worked to deliberately position ourselves to be lined up to capture the forces associated with pharmacological innovation and we've positioned our company to play a leading role in connecting patients with the medicines that they need there. At our Investor Day back in March, we again increased the top end of our long-term growth range for Evernorth up to 5% to 8% growth, and that reflects all of these dynamics. And so that's the I think the fourth time we increased the growth trajectory of Evernorth since Evernorth was launched just a few years ago, and we're excited about the opportunity to continue to grow in this space are the same, the positive forces that we've just talked about and the ability to have a meaningful positive influence on affordability of health care and the patients that we serve overall. So we're excited about the opportunity and well positioned to play a leading role here. Operator : Thank you. I'd like to turn the call back to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : Thank you. I just want to briefly wrap up. Most importantly, thanks for your questions, your time and your engagement on our call today. Just to highlight a few headlines. Cigna Group once again, given our business momentum and complementary growth platforms delivered a strong third quarter, and we remain on track to deliver our 2024 EPS outlook of at least $20.40, and we're on track for another competitively differentiated year in 2025. Before I close, I want to thank our 70,000 colleagues around the world and a fantastic senior leadership team. It's their focus, caring orientation and commitment that allows us to do what we do day in, day out for those we have the privilege to serve. We're proud of what we've accomplished in the third quarter and the trajectory that we have for the full-year, and we look forward to talking you in the future. Have a great day.

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter the queue to ask question at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, the Cigna Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Evanko, Chief Financial Officer of the Cigna Group, and President and Chief Executive Officer of Cigna Healthcare; and Eric Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evernorth Health Services. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including our fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results and our financial outlook for 2025. Following their prepared remarks, David, Brian, and Eric will be available for Q&A. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures, including adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders' net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of the CignaGroup.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance.  In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2025 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Regarding our results, in the fourth quarter, we recorded net after-tax special item charges of $64 million, or $0.23 per share. Details of the special items are included in our quarterly financial supplement. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2025 outlook, we'll do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2025 dividends. With that, I'll turn the call over to David. David Cordani : Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Today, I'll discuss key headlines from the quarter and our full year 2024 performance. I'll also share more on the actions we are accelerating to build a better and more sustainable healthcare model. And then Brian will provide additional details on our financial results in our 2025 outlook, and we'll take your questions. Before I get into our earnings, I want to start by sharing a few comments on the current environment. During my tenure as a leader of the Cigna Group, there have been a number of periods in our industry where we faced unique challenges, whether the financial crisis, the introduction of the ACA, the global pandemic, or several significant shifts in political, regulatory, and societal landscape. At the Cigna Group, our resilience and the durability of our business model have allowed us not only to overcome obstacles, but to lead through change while focusing on achieving our long-term objectives for sustainable growth. In early December we all witnessed the tragic murder of Brian Thompson, a leader at the UnitedHealth Group. The past several weeks have further challenged us to even more intensely listen to the public narrative about our industry. At the Cigna Group, we are further accelerating improvements and innovations to increase transparency, expand support, and drive even greater accountability. I'll come back to this important topic in a few moments. With that, let me start with a summary of our 2024 results. We delivered full-year revenue growth of 27% to approximately $247 billion. Full-year adjusted earnings per share of $27.33, representing an increase of 9% year-over-year, but short of our expectations. We returned $8.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. And our Board of Directors declared an 8% increase to our quarterly dividend to $1.51 per share, and increased our share repurchase authority to $10.3 billion. The Cigna Group also maintained a strong capital position in 2024. We're also nearly complete with the sale of our Cigna Healthcare Medicare business to HCSC, and we continue to expect to close in the first quarter and plan to use the majority of the proceeds for share repurchase. Now turning to our business results and actions, I want to cover just a few headlines. First, our fourth quarter results were below expectations due to higher than expected medical costs in our stop loss product within Cigna Healthcare. We are taking corrective actions on this near-term pressure and expect to recapture margin over the next two years. This is a specific issue we identified and are mitigating, and I'll reinforce that we believe our U.S. employer and Cigna Healthcare businesses are strong and remain well positioned, and we're confident in our long-term growth strategy. Brian will discuss this in greater detail in his remarks. The second headline for the quarter is that Evernorth continues to drive strong results in line with our expectations, primarily driven by our specialty and care services segment. Our continued leadership of biosimilars is a good example of how we are addressing some of the biggest challenges facing clients and patients today. We began dispensing our Humira interchangeable biosimilar last summer to eligible Accredo patients with $0 cost to our patients. We are pleased that biosimilar use for eligible Humira scripts reached nearly 50% by year-end 2024. We took another step forward as we announced that we\u2019ll begin offering an interchangeable Stelara Biosimilar, again for $0 cost to our patients. Looking forward, we expect approximately $100 billion of specialty drug spend in the U.S. will be subject to biosimilar and generic competition over the next five years. Our Humira and Stelara Biosimilar offerings are just the start of this opportunity, and Accredo is well positioned to lead and continue to deliver real savings for clients, customers, and patients. Now, stepping back, prescription drug coverage is the most frequently used healthcare benefit. On average, it's used about 15x per year per person, and how our nation and industry captures the full promise of prescription drug innovation, while addressing affordability has been subject to continued debate. Pharmacy benefit managers are essential in helping patients\u2019 access medications at fair and affordable prices. In fact, approximately 80% of Express Scripts patients spend less than $100 out-of-pocket per year for their prescriptions. Yet, we recognize for those Express Scripts patients who pay more than $100. For some, it's too high. For example, consider the increased use of GLP-1s in the United States. It is the number one driver of drug trend across employers of all sizes since 2024. Despite these medications being relatively cheap to produce, Americans are paying prices that are multiples higher for GLP-1s compared to other countries, even with full pass-through of rebates. Said otherwise, even including all discounts and rebates, the end result is that the U.S. costs are multiples higher than other OECD countries. This is not acceptable nor sustainable. As for innovations, led by Evernorth and Express Scripts, we are proud that last year our EnCircle Rx solution grew to approximately 8 million lives enrolled. We are supporting the best possible patient outcomes by providing those on GLP-1s, additional lifestyle support and tools to help sustain long-term improvement. Now, the next headline I want to touch on a bit more is the current environment. We have long been on a path to evolve and drive continuous improvement. As we step into 2025, we have further strengthened our urgency and resolve on this path. That means we are accelerating investments that will positively impact the way our customers and patients experience healthcare. To that end, this week we announced actions we are taking in Express Scripts, our pharmacy benefit service business within Evernorth. Our commitment will help patients directly benefit further from the negotiations we drive to lower out-of-pocket costs, as well as work to further enhance transparency. Let me briefly recap the announcements. Going forward, our standard products will provide patients lower prices at the pharmacy counter, protecting them from paying full list prices for drugs, and they will fully benefit from our lower net negotiated prices. Next, patients will also have improved predictability, especially and importantly in their deductible phase, by receiving the benefit of Express Scripts negotiated savings like their employer does. We will also expand the benefit summaries and disclosures we provide. Patients will receive a personalized summary that details their annual total prescription drug costs, plan paid amounts, and the savings we deliver. And planned sponsors will also receive an enhanced report beyond what Express Scripts already provides, including additional transparency on costs and pharmacy claim level insights. We know that more can be done within our health plan offering as well, for customers and patients as well as clinical partners, to further ease access to care timeliness and expand support programs. More specifically, Cigna Healthcare will soon be announcing steps to improve value and address patient points of friction. Our focus is on making prior authorizations faster and simpler and expanding access to advocates for those facing complex health conditions to help them navigate every stage of their care journey. These initiatives will require that we incur additional costs, but we firmly believe these are critical actions for the benefit of customers and patients. We will continue to take a prudent approach to these and future Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth actions in the weeks and months ahead, as we are determined to continue to evolve for the benefit of those we serve and build a more sustainable healthcare model. Now let me briefly summarize. Against the backdrop of a dynamic and challenging environment, in 2024, we delivered full-year adjusted earnings per share of $27.33. And we returned $8.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. Looking ahead to 2025, our EPS outlook of at least $29.50 reinforces the sustained growth and strength of our company, and we are focused on taking the prudent steps necessary to ensure our company is well-positioned for future growth. And we remain confident in our long-term 10% to 14% growth target, fueled by our differentiated capabilities and portfolio of businesses. Finally, we recognize the need for accelerated positive change in our healthcare system to make it simpler and more affordable for everyone. And the Cigna Group is committed to continuing to take actions to drive further accountability and transparency as well. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Evanko : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today I'll review Cigna's fourth quarter and full-year 2024 results, and I'll provide our outlook for 2025. For full-year 2024, we reported consolidated adjusted revenues of $247.1 billion, adjusted after-tax earnings of $7.7 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $27.33. Our performance within the Evernorth Health Services segment ended the year strong with particular momentum in specialty and care services. Despite this, our enterprise earnings results fell short of our expectations, driven by higher than expected medical costs in our stop loss products within the Cigna Healthcare segment. This resulted in a full-year medical care ratio of 83.2%, which was above our guidance range. We are taking corrective action to recapture margin, and we remain confident in the long-term strength of our business despite this short-term pressure. Now more specific to Cigna Healthcare's fourth quarter results, fourth quarter 2024 revenues were $13.3 billion, pre-tax adjusted earnings were $511 million, and the medical care ratio was 87.9%. As I noted, fourth quarter earnings fell below our expectations as we observed elevated medical costs in stop loss. Results of our other products were in line with expectations, exhibiting a continuation of elevated trends that we had seen throughout the year. Taking a step back, it's important to note that stop loss is a unique product within our portfolio where employers limit their risk from unexpected high-cost claims by transferring that risk for medical costs above a specific individual or aggregate employer dollar amount. We can see variability in this product at times, but we've generated and continue to expect attractive margins over the long term. This year, variability was more pronounced in the fourth quarter as we had an increase in the number of high-cost claimants related to cost pressures from the continued acceleration in the prescribing and use of specialty medications, as well as elevated high-acuity surgical activity. The fourth quarter also tends to be when more client settlements transpire, including true-ups for the full calendar year of activity. We had seen some of these trends emerge in the third quarter and began pricing for higher trend on high-dollar claims, but did not capture the full extent of this trend acceleration that materialized in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we expect a slightly higher MCR for stop loss in 2025. While this negatively impacts near-term margin, we expect to recapture approximately 100 basis points of margin in the overall Cigna Healthcare segment over the next two years, with the majority in 2026 and the remaining in 2027. We will do this by balancing pricing action, affordability initiatives, operating cost efficiency, and continued investments. Now turning to Evernorth, 2024 highlighted another year of sustained growth, particularly within the specialty and care segment, highlighting the attractiveness of our market-leading clinical capabilities and innovative solutions that create affordability for customers and patients amidst the growing trend of pharmacological innovation. Adjusted revenues for fourth quarter 2024 grew 33% to $53.7 billion, and pre-tax adjusted earnings grew 14% to $2.1 billion, in line with expectations. Moving to our businesses within Evernorth, specialty and care services adjusted revenue grew 18% to $23.5 billion, and adjusted earnings grew 27% to $948 million. This continues the pattern observed from last quarter, which reflects growth across our specialty businesses, driven by higher utilization of specialty medications, as well as a continued increase in the adoption of Humira biosimilars. By the end of the fourth quarter, we saw almost half of eligible Humira scripts transition to biosimilars. Pharmacy benefit services also posted robust growth, reflecting client wins and the continued demand for new drugs through our innovative products and solutions. Pre-tax adjusted earnings increased to $1.2 billion, as our differentiated capabilities continue to drive affordability and value to our patients, customers and clients. Overall, the fourth quarter capped another strong year for Evernorth, with full-year pre-tax adjusted earnings growing 9% for the year. We are the industry leader in pharmacy benefit services and in specialty pharmacy, and our strong 2024 performance gives us confidence for sustained attractive growth over the long term. Now, turning to our 2025 outlook. First, I'd note that the divestiture of our Medicare businesses to HCSC remains on track to close in the first quarter, and this is contemplated in our outlook. We expect full year 2025 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $252 billion, and we expect full year 2025 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $7.9 billion or at least $29.50 per share. As David mentioned, we are accelerating investments that will positively impact the way our customers and patients experience healthcare. Our outlook reflects up to $150 million in costs for these initiatives, split between Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. When considering earnings seasonality, 2024 is not representative of typical patterns, given the dynamics I referenced with our stop loss products. As such, we would expect the adjusted earnings per share pattern for 2025 to be more similar to 2023's pattern. Now, turning to our 2025 outlook for each of our segments. In Evernorth, we expect full-year 2025 adjusted earnings of at least $7.2 billion. This represents year-over-year growth within our long-term growth target range on a normalized basis. Within Evernorth, we expect first quarter earnings to contribute slightly below 20% of full year Evernorth earnings. For Cigna Healthcare, we expect full year 2025 adjusted earnings of at least $4.1 billion. This represents mid-single digit year-over-year growth on a normalized basis. Within Cigna Healthcare, we expect approximately 55% of full-year earnings to be in the first half of the year, slightly more weighted to the first quarter. Assumptions in our Cigna Healthcare outlook for 2025 include our medical care ratio to be in the range of 83.2% to 84.2%. This reflects the expectation that our stop loss MCR continues to be above target levels for full year 2025. We expect the first quarter 2025 medical care ratio to be below the low end of the full year guidance range to reflect typical seasonal patterns. We expect approximately 18.1 million total medical customers at year-end, reflecting the divestiture of our Medicare businesses to HCSC, a reduction in individual exchange customers, and growth within our U.S. employer select and middle market segments. For the enterprise, we project an adjusted SG&A ratio of approximately 5.4% for 2025. This percentage is lower in 2025, largely reflecting mix due to the absence of our Medicare businesses, which carried a higher SG&A ratio compared to the consolidated average, and we expect the consolidated adjusted tax rate to be approximately 19%. Now, moving to our 2024 capital management position and 2025 capital outlook. Our fourth-quarter cash flow is quite strong, and we finished full year by delivering $10.4 billion of cash flow from operations. In 2024, we repurchased 20.9 million shares of common stock for approximately $7 billion. In addition, the Board of Directors recently approved an increase of $6 billion in incremental share repurchase authorization, bringing the company's total share repurchase authorization to $10.3 billion as of December 31, 2024. Finally, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders via dividends in 2024. Now framing our 2025 capital outlook, we expect to deliver approximately $10 billion of cash flow from operations with the strength of our efficient service-based model. We expect to deploy approximately $1.4 billion to capital expenditures, and we expect to deploy approximately $1.6 billion to shareholder dividends, reflecting our quarterly dividend of $1.51 per share, an 8% increase on a per-share basis. Our guidance assumes full-year weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 266 million to 270 million shares. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent with our long-term framework. We expect some debt paydown in 2025 as we look to bring our leverage ratio closer to our 40% target. As it relates to the sale of our Medicare businesses, we continue to expect a majority of proceeds will go toward share repurchase. Now, to close. As we look to 2025 and beyond, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and our ability to deliver sustainable growth through a differentiated portfolio of businesses. As David mentioned, we're operating in a highly dynamic environment. But as we've demonstrated in the past, we have a proven track record of meeting challenges and taking the actions to deliver affordable and innovative solutions for our customers and patients. We're confident in our ability to deliver full-year 2025 adjusted earnings of at least $29.50 per share, which we believe is prudent at this time, given the dynamic environment. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Justin Lake with Wolf Research. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask a couple of things on the stop loss business. First on the $7 billion of premium, I was hoping you can give us some split between the aggregate versus specific stop loss premiums, and then maybe tell us if there was any more margin pressure in one segment versus the other in the fourth quarter. I then wanted to just make sure I'm understanding the magnitude of the miss correctly here. You talked about the fourth quarter miss being all stop loss, so I'm getting to like 1,500 basis points in the fourth quarter, because that\u2019s in the ballpark. And I think you said your margins overall are 100 basis points higher because of this or lower that you'll recapture, which would seem to indicate stop loss is off by about 5% given the percentage of revenue. Just trying to make sure \u2013 I was just making sure I understand all of that correctly. Any help appreciated. Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Justin. It's Brian. A number of components to your question, so I'll do my best to capture as much of that as possible. Let me just start with a little bit of context on the stop loss business, and then I'll try to get to your very specific questions there on my way through here. So obviously we're disappointed by the shortfall that we reported in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned in my prepared comments earlier, the vast majority of the shortfall was driven by our stop loss products within Cigna Healthcare, and the rest of the company performed broadly as we expected. Now, it's important to keep in mind that our stop loss product performance in the quarter is really more representative of the full-year impact, because it's an accumulation product reflecting 12 months of healthcare activity for a given individual or an employer. And we continue to feel very good about the long-term fundamentals of our U.S. employer portfolio and the stop loss product specifically, and the shortfall that we're currently experiencing represents an embedded earnings opportunity for the future. As we look back at 2024, the aggregate healthcare costs within the Cigna Healthcare portfolio were broadly in line with our expectations, reflecting the persistently elevated cost trend environment that I referenced. But the mix of those costs shifted more toward high-cost claimants than we had expected, which has a disproportionate impact on the stop loss products. And given when we identified the magnitude of the 2024 stop loss pressure, we were not able to fully recognize this in our January 2025 renewal pricing, as much of that pricing work was completed in the fall. Now, some of the later 2025 renewals will reflect the updated estimates, but the majority of the 2025 stop loss pricing will not capture that elevated cost structure. So when you put all those pieces together, we would expect to see 100 basis points of margin improvement across the Cigna Healthcare portfolio by 2027, with the majority of that to be captured in 2026. Now, more specifically to your questions, when you think about the $6.7 billion of premium in our stop loss book of business, there's a mix of individual and aggregate stop loss in there, and there are a variety of attachment points and different client choices embedded in there. You can think of it as more tilted toward the individual versus the aggregate, but we have a wide range of stop loss offerings that are out there. And for full year 2024, the overall stop loss MCR ran in the low 90\u2019s in terms of the percentage, which you can think of as being a mid-single digit percentage amount, worse than our expectations had been in 2024. So again, that $6.7 billion of premium multiplied by a mid-single digit percentage miss gets you about the earnings impact that we're seeking to recover over time on the stop loss portion of the portfolio. But importantly, the balance of the Cigna Healthcare portfolio ran broadly in line with expectations. Thanks for your question. Justin Lake : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Stephen Baxter : Hi. Thanks for the question. I'm going to ask another one on stop loss. I guess when you've gone through these cycles in the past, can you talk a little bit about how it's impacted retention and membership for the impacted accounts that have seen these kind of larger above-trend increases for stop loss? And you know, I can definitely appreciate why it takes until at least 2026 to get meaningful improvement. But when you are talking about some of this improvement leaking out into 2027 potentially, could you just help us understand a little bit why it could become, you know, even that far extended? Thank you. Brian Evanko : Hi, Stephen. It's Brian again. So, one thing that's critical to keep in mind as it relates to our stop loss portfolio is that we don't write standalone stop loss coverage. So our entire book of business reflects an integrated employer offering where we're providing the first-dollar coverage alongside. So as a result, our overall relationship with the employer is multifaceted in nature and it involves many products and solutions, which ends up creating numerous opportunities for value creation and the associated value capture. And even with the stop loss claims pressure that we experienced in our 2024 results, our overall client level relationships are profitable for those employers who choose our stop loss offerings. When we look back historically over many years, decades in fact, we've been able to overcome the short-term ups and downs of our stop loss portfolio and generate attractive long-term returns. And our clients value these long-term relationships and the associated budget certainty that our offerings can provide to them, which really is evidenced by the fact that well over 50% of our employer clients who choose our stop loss products have been clients of Cigna Healthcare for five years or more. So, the shortfall in our 2024 results offers a substantial embedded earnings opportunity for the company, and we're confident in our ability to execute against this, balancing the timing of margin recovery with client persistency. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Charles Rhyee : Yeah, thanks for taking the question. Just related to sort of the stop loss again a little bit, you called out specialty NEDs at the start contributing to that. Is that related to GLP-1s at all? And related to that, as we think about the Evernorth guide going forward, you are starting at a 3% operating income growth starting point. But you finish \u201824 up 9%, which if I remember correctly, right, included onboarding costs related to the same team in the first half of the year. Anything to call out relative to \u201925, because otherwise it seems -- you know this part of the guidance seems pretty conservative, particularly given the growth you saw in specialty in the back half of \u201824. Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Charles. This is Brian. So, as it relates to the stop loss specific drivers, which I think was the core of your first question, you can think of this as being at a situation where we had a greater frequency of high-dollar claimants than we had been expecting, particularly driven by high-cost specialty pharmaceuticals and by high-acuity surgical activity. Now, within the specialty drugs, I would not point to GLP-1s as a driver of this. Think of it as more specialty injectables. So when you look at the nature of that, particularly for the stop loss books, its drugs like Keytruda or Ocrevus, those sorts of specialty injectables that drove some of the upward pressure. And then on the high-acuity surgical side, think of that as more tilted to inpatient procedures, for example, oncology and cardiac-oriented procedures. So that was really the core of the upward pressure on the stop loss products. Now, as it relates to Evernorth's 2025 income outlook, I'd start by saying how pleased we are with the overall performance of that portion of the company. We delivered a strong result in \u201824, as you noted in your question. As it relates to 2025 specifically, our outlook for the income growth is within our long-term growth rate range of 5% to 8% when a few adjustments are made, so specifically the absence of Village MD net investment income, which was recorded in 2024, as well as the Evernorth share of stranded overhead from the Medicare divestiture. And then as I noted in my prepared comments, we have earmarked up to $150 million across the company for incremental 2025 investments in patient and provider-facing initiatives, and our guidance reflects a portion of that spending in the Evernorth segment. So adjusting for these factors, we look forward to Evernorth delivering income growth within our long-term average annual growth rate range. So overall, Evernorth is performing well. We're positioned for another good year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JP Morgan. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Lisa Gill : All right. Thanks very much, and good morning. David, I wanted to go back to the comments that you made around express strips and some of the offerings that you now have, lowering the price at the counter, etc., and really tie that back to comments you've made in the past around roughly 20% of total profits coming from rebate retention. Can you talk about two things? One, are clients shifting more where they want, more of the rebate retention, and if so, how do we think about that impact of profitability over time? And then secondly, the programs that you talked about, are those more of an opt-in, so you are selling those into the marketplace. And I'm just curious around, what you're seeing on the uptake side. So really two questions here, how I think about the future, and if we have changes, what that could do to the profit of the model, and then secondly, the uptake around this. David Cordani :  Morning, Lisa. It's David. I'll start and I'm going to ask Eric to expand. I think your latter part of your comment and question was the summary you are seeking. At the enterprise level, we do not see this as a change to our profit model. So I'll come back to that headline in a moment. We've worked for an elongated period of time through innovation, through ongoing efficiency, to continue to deliver more value while maintaining an attractive margin, and by maintaining it a stable low single digit margin, which we think is responsible given the nature of this book of business. Coming back up to the top, I'd ask you to not think that your statement was 20% of the profit is correlated to rebate retention. The vast majority of rebates are passed through today. The model has evolved rather rapidly for the vast majority of all rebates being passed through. We continue to offer choice in the marketplace. There are instances where employers, large sophisticated employers, or collective bargaining arrangement unions want to continue to use rebates a little differently in their overall benefit program. And then to the core of the center part of your question, we're really excited about, and I couldn't be more appreciative and proud of the innovation of our team with the most recent innovations we announced this week, which take even more precision to identify those patients who due to deductible phases or otherwise have some financial dislocation. As I noted, 80% of all Express Scripts customers have less than $100 cumulative out of pocket through the course of the entire year. However, we recognize some have more, and we need to bring more precision there, and that's where some of the new innovations are targeted. So I'll ask Eric to expand a little bit more on those exciting innovations. Eric Palmer : Great. Thanks David and good morning Lisa. As David noted, as you noted, we announced yesterday a couple of additional enhancements that just build on our track record of innovations to make medicines more affordable. So first, we announced that customers will not have to pay less price at the pharmacy counter, and regardless of where they are at with deductibles, our go forward approach will be to ensure that they get the benefits of the discounts we negotiate. Second, for customers who are in a phase of a deductible or a coinsurance plan, we'll work to ensure that they receive the same price as their underlying plan would pay, and we also announced an additional series of patient and plan sponsor level reporting enhancements building on the transparency we deliver. So taken together, those are just another example, set of examples in our track record and our history of continuing to bring innovations to market. And then the kind of last piece of your question, I'd expect this will be the default way that we bring these solutions to market for employers and the like. As David noted, our clients undertake significant work to structure their benefits in a deliberate way, and we offer them choice in how they wish to structure them. But as the years passed, rebate value that we share with our clients is continuing to increase, and we're proud of the choices we're able to offer and the work that we do to bring improved affordability to medicines to the millions of people we serve. Lisa Gill : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from AJ Rice with UBS. Your line is open. You may ask your question. AJ Rice : Hi, everybody. Just to maybe get a little bit of clarification on a couple of points with respect to the 2025 guidance. I think now, and when you gave some preliminary comments on third quarter, I don't think you had incorporated this, but now you're incorporating the sale of the MA book by the end of the first quarter in the outlook as well as presumably some redeployment of that capital. I'm trying to figure out how much, what is the underlying assumption around what that does to the earnings outlook of the company when you start to factor that in. Also, I think the other aspect of the 2025 outlook was there was some pressure on the Evernorth margin at \u201824 related to the big new contract wins that you are absorbing, and that there was presumably going to be some favorable step up in \u201825 as that contract, that one big contract, in fact, matured a little bit. Are you assuming some level of step up on that or are you now sort of assuming it's sort of steady state margin? Brian Evanko : Morning, AJ. It's Brian. So let me do my best with your questions here. The former, in terms of the Medicare divestiture, as I mentioned earlier, on track to close in the first quarter. We reflected that in the revenue and the income guide, as well as the capital deployment expectations here for the year. And you can think of it as about $12 billion of revenue from 2024. That will be obviously removed with the divestiture. We'll recognize a stub year here with one month of January revenue and then whenever the closing date happens to be in February or March.  As it relates to capital deployment, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to use the majority of the proceeds for share repurchase. That's reflected in our share count guide. And then relative to the other contributions, when you think about the Cigna Healthcare income guide, the removal of Medicare is reflected in that. So maybe just to put a finer point on that, if you look at our segment income guide for Cigna Healthcare this year and you compare it to 2024, if you look at 2024's actual income and remove the contribution from the Medicare financials, remove the stranded overhead from the divestiture, and remove the favorable prior year development that we saw in 2024, the normalized Cigna Healthcare earnings would have been slightly below $4 billion in 2024. So that just gives you a basis to compare our 2025 outlook, reflecting the removal of Medicare and the removal of the prior year development, and we do not forecast a future prior year development. As it relates to the client contribution in Evernorth and the guide that I walked through to the earlier question that Charles asked me, the implied normalized growth rate that I referenced being within our 5% to 8% long-term growth rate range reflects the continued maturation of our large client contracts. So it's in there. The relationship continues to be very strong across the teams and we're pleased with the overall financial contribution of that relationship. AJ Rice : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to sort of put the stop loss repricing efforts into some context. You know, first just curious around the fact that we know that the stop loss pressures were not unique to Cigna. We did see data points during the quarter from other large stop loss carriers, also discussing very similar effects. So the first piece would be as you reprice the business in \u201825 and into \u201926. Do you think that the persistency of the clients may benefit from the fact that others in the market will also be needing to take similar pricing actions? And then, when we think about the sort of the renewal cycle of the clients that typically take stop loss for Cigna, which has always been a bit more weighted towards selected in middle market, there's a different renewal cycle for those clients. They're not as entirely weighted to sort of Gen 1, for example. So basically, also if you could remind us, for \u201825 basically, walk us through how much of the business you still have an opportunity to reprice on where you've seen these higher stop loss costs. Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Scott. It's Brian. So as it relates to your first question in terms of the client relationships, the timing to recover, etc., and putting that into context, as I mentioned to the earlier question I think Stephen had asked me, it\u2019s important to keep in mind, these are all integrated client relationships where we have both, the first dollar and the stop loss coverage. And if you look across the totality of the relationships, on average, about 20% of a given client's cost is stop loss oriented in terms of the clients that choose to work with us on stop loss. About on average, 20% of it is stop loss. Some are higher, some are lower, depending on how much risk appetite they have, how much risk they seek to transfer. So the point being, a point of overall claim cost is only 20% of that on the stop loss. So there's a little bit more of a buffer here as it relates to repricing in terms of the overall client persistency, which in our estimation gives us an advantage being an integrated stop loss carrier compared to the standalone stop loss carriers who might be competing up against this. Now, your question on the renewal cycles, the way that our stop loss products happen to work, it's actually a little bit more tilted toward the beginning of the year. So we have about two-thirds of our stop loss premium that renews in the first quarter, given that we also have large clients who purchase stop loss from us. So it's not quite as uniformly distributed throughout the calendar year as our select segment happens to be. And as a result of that, that's one of the primary reasons why we're not able to recapture more in 2025. Again, we have the confidence that we'll capture a majority of that 100 basis points at Cigna Healthcare margin expansion in 2026 with any residual in 2027. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Your line is open. Erin Wright : Great, thanks. So you spoke to the buyback authorization increase, but how are you thinking about, I guess capital deployment from an acquisition standpoint, and just any sort of change in your thought process around the regulatory environment on that front or just your broader framework and thought process around acquisitions, I guess, has anything changed there? Thanks. David Cordani : Erin, good morning. It's David. First, to frame the M&A question, our capital priorities remain intact and consistent in terms of how we deploy our capital in terms of supporting the ongoing growth of the business, including our CapEx, which we have a disciplined process attached to that, and then evaluating both, strategic M&A and ongoing deployment of targeted M&A activities, which I'll come back to in a moment. And as both Brian and I noted, an attractive dividend sits in there as a part of it that continues to grow. Now, specific to M&A, first, our three growth platforms continue to perform well, and we just highlight and amplify how pleased we are overall with the sustained performance there and call out the specific significant growth opportunity we continue to see in the specialty and care platform. By way of just our actions and our words lining up, as we noted, we deployed in excess of $8.5 billion in 2024, mostly for share repurchase, as well as with dividend payments, and our capital outlook and our cash flow outlook of greater than 10% cash yield for 2025 remains attractive. So as we look forward, we will continue to evaluate strategic, what we consider bolt-on acquisitions that will advance our portfolio, but our ongoing growth of our core platforms will be the underlying driver, and we will support that with ongoing share repurchase, as we believe that is a prudent ongoing investment back into the organization, and we'll evaluate those targeted bolt-on acquisitions as they make good strategic sense for us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Mok with Barclays. Your line is opening. You may ask your question. Andrew Mok : Hi. I understand the different mechanics of the stop loss business, but if you're seeing pressure in that part of the business related to higher specialty cost trends, I'm a little confused why you are not seeing that pressure on the fully insured part of the business. Maybe you can help clarify that. Thank you. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Andrew. It's Brian. So as it relates to your question on the different pockets of the Cigna healthcare portfolio, maybe I'll expand a little bit on the MCR performance for the different components. But again, I'd come back to something I said earlier, where the all-in cost structure that we saw in 2024 was comparable to what we expected it to be, an elevated cost structure, but comparable to what we had planned in price for in totality. But the mix of those costs shifted more toward high-cost claimants than what we had been anticipating coming into the year. If you think about the Cigna healthcare portfolio in aggregate, you can think of it as three broad components. So the largest portion of Cigna Healthcare, which represents about 60% of the Cigna healthcare premium and is unrelated to stop loss, unrelated to Medicare, so think of everything else, broadly in line with expectations. And we ended the 2024 full year with an MCR of around 80% on that block of business. So that 60% ran at about 80% MCR. And we're projecting a roughly similar MCR performance in 2025 for that portion of the book, as our pricing yields are expected to track cost trends on that portion. The second component is our Medicare business, which represents about 25% of the Cigna healthcare premium and ran broadly in line with expectations in 2024. And then the final 15% is the stop loss products, the stop loss products. So for 2024, as I mentioned in Justin's earlier question, the overall stop loss ran in the low 90s on that 15% portion of the book. So we ended up seeing, within the total healthcare pie, a shift toward more high-cost individual claimants, putting pressure on the stop loss line, but the all-in fully insured products ran broadly in line with expectations. David, do you want to add anything? David Cordani :  Sure. Thanks Brian. And Andrew, maybe just to give you an illustration to click that down a notch, as you are rightfully thinking about the aggregate cost structure versus stop loss. For example, if you take facility costs for 2024, we saw a bit more moderation in lower-dollar inpatient events, but an acceleration of higher-dollar inpatient events. And you can think about those as cardiac surgical events or oncological events. In the oncological events, aided by specialty pharmaceuticals as they correlate against oncological programs. So that's an example where the aggregate inpatient may be closer to what we thought it would be throughout the course of the year, because of the deceleration or the less growth on the lower dollar inpatient costs versus the higher dollar, it aggregates more in the stop loss component. That's an illustration of what Brian was articulating. Thanks. Andrew Mok : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just on the pending Medicare sale, asset sale to Healthcare Service Corp., are there any potential adjustments to the purchase price based on revenues, membership, MLR, and maybe a comment on the strong membership to start 2025? And then any pending approvals or any sort of last-minute things you are looking for? David Cordani : Good morning, Josh. Its Brian. So overall, I'd just start by saying the Medicare businesses perform broadly in line with expectations in 2024, and we're on track to close the divestiture in the first quarter as I mentioned earlier. We have a very collaborative, constructive relationship with HCFC. We've completed all federal antitrust approvals and nearly all state approvals, just one more state to get through. We have typical financial adjustments to the final purchase price in terms of subsidiary capitalization and things along those lines, but nothing else that I would note that's particularly relevant to the core of your question. Now, as we approach 2025 as we always do, we employed a local market county-level bid approach, and based upon our final product positioning, we did see attractive growth in this business, specifically in the geographies and the products where we were targeting. In particular, we were pleased to see net growth coming primarily from HMO products in our more mature markets where we have years of experience and strong provider relationships. So the business is on a solid footing. We're tracking for attractive growth in 2025, and we're ready to hand it off to HCFC. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Ron with Bank of America. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Adam Ron : Hey. I'd like to dig a little deeper into the Evernorth guidance. I know we somewhat touched on it already, but if you could distill it down into a couple more specific items. So just curious, like this time last year, what gave you the confidence to raise the growth rate in the segment that has now come in worse than those at higher expectations? It sounds like specialty growth in particular is coming in better, if anything. So are there any specific items like VillageMD or on-trend guarantees that you gave customers that are driving the underperformance for 2025 in the outlook? Thanks. David Cordani : Adam, let me ask Eric just to start to talk about the strategic positioning of the business and the ongoing sustained growth of the components in the business with our sustained strong performance of our PBS, and to talk a little bit about the retention rates and the growth profile, as well as the ongoing focus on the innovations within our specialty business. And then, Brian, if you can take it from Eric and just talk a little bit further around the number aspect of where Adam's question comes back to. Eric? Eric Palmer : Adam, it's Eric. Thanks. Good morning. I'd start at the headline. We're really proud of the growth rate and the track record that we've had here. In fact, we've increased the growth rate for Evernorth a number of times over the course of the last number of years and are committed to and excited about the long-term growth rate of 5% to 8% that we see for the Evernorth portfolio overall. And I wouldn't call out anything that's changed relative to that as the long-term growth rate for the segment. We are continued and committed to delivering that. Brian walked through a couple of the specific kind of tactical items that were incorporated as we built up our 2025 specific guidance, and I think about those in the short term. But the long-term tailwinds and our positioning for innovation across both, the pharmacy benefit services and the specialty and care services portfolio continue to be set up really well. We're leaders in both of these spaces, and we think there are real opportunities for us to continue to grow and thrive there. Brian? Brian Evanko : Thanks, Eric. And just to reiterate, there are three unique items as you look at the \u201825 over \u201824 Evernorth income growth rate. The VillageMD recognition of the dividend, that was in \u201824 and will not be there in \u201825. Stranded overhead from the Medicare divestiture, a portion of that will sit in the Evernorth P&L in 2025. And then finally, the investments that I made reference to that David covered earlier, we've earmarked at the enterprise level up to $150 million, split between the Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare segments that will hit the 2025 P&L. So those three items are discrete \u201825 over \u201824 items, but the long-term megatrends remain very intact, as Eric mentioned earlier. Adam Ron : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Security. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Ann Hynes : Hi. Good morning. I just want some more clarity on 2025 MLR. So I think you said earlier that office 6.7 billion basis stop loss was off mid-single digit. So if I do the calculation, that's maybe like around a $335 million or $340 million dollar hit versus expectation. But when I look at the 2025 healthcare EBITDA, it's about $800 million below the street. So I'm just trying to figure out what the difference is versus our expectations. Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Ann. It's Brian. So as it relates to the stop loss dynamic we were discussing earlier, that was a 2024 reference when I described the low 90s MCR on the stop loss book on the $6.7 billion of premium. For \u201825, we're expecting a slightly higher MCR on the stop loss book, because of the timing of every pricing cycle. And as I made reference, we're unable to capture all of the elevated cost trend on the stop loss for 2025. So we expect a slightly higher MCR on stop loss in 2025, and that'll be on a higher premium base, because that $6.7 billion will grow at an attractive rate again. So that dollar amount will grow in \u201825. In addition, as I made reference earlier, we do not forecast future prior year development, which was a benefit to 2024, and we have earmarked up to $150 million at the enterprise level for the provider and patient facing initiatives that David described, and a portion of that will be reflected in the Cigna Healthcare P&L. So those dynamics help to bridge, I think where you were going with the 2025 prior expectations to our 2025 guidance we've initiated today. Ann Hynes : All right. Thanks. Very helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question. Your line is open. Sarah James : Thank you. Since you started seeing the stop loss claims pressure into 3Q, was some of that pressure already included in the 3Q guide as more than 10% growth, and was any of the 150 investment spend included in that? Because I'm trying to run the math bridging the 8% to the more than 10%, and I kind of feel like I'm missing a few good guides. So I'm wondering if your outlook improved on some of your other businesses. Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Sarah. It's Brian. So the third quarter commentary that we made again, was not meant to be formal guidance. It was meant to be just directional guidance, and at the time we had said at least 10%, which we felt was at a prudent growth rate range at that point in time. You may also recall we had moved the MCR guide for the full year at that point in time toward the upper end of the range, because we've started to see some indications of some pressure on the stop loss, but not to the degree that ultimately manifested across the full year. So as you think about trying to do that bridge, the couple of things that I'd call out would be, we have now factored in the up to $150 million of investment spend for the provider and patient facing initiatives that David walked through, that's not new. The degree of the stop loss pressure for the full year \u201824 was greater than what we had anticipated three months ago, that's not new. And then to your point, are there other things going better than expected across the company? Directionally, you should think of the growth is strong yet again. So if you remove the Medicare business, we expect top line for the company will grow in the call it 6% range. So we expect to have another year of good growth across the enterprise. So broadly speaking, I would think of it in those different buckets. But again, the third quarter commentary was not meant to be formal guidance. It's just trying to give you some directional sense. Sarah James : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Ben Hendrix : Great. Thank you for squeezing me in here. I just was hoping you could put a finer point on your 2025 earnings cadence comments. I appreciate the commentary that you would expect earnings to look a little bit more like 2023 patterns versus 2024, but knowing that we're going to be recapturing the stop loss margins over a number of years, any reason not to expect elevated 4Q cost trend in 2025 as well? Just any comments on that seasonality? Thanks. Brian Evanko : Good morning, Ben. It's Brian. So, just the nature of the stop loss products as I was referencing earlier are really full year products. And so each quarter, we're making estimates of where the final full year MCR will land for stop loss. In 2024, when the pressure was identified, it was late in the year, which is why the earnings impact showed up predominantly in the fourth quarter. But you should take that earnings impact and kind of spread it over the course of the full year 2024, which is why we're saying that \u201824 seasonality is not reflective of what a typical year should look like. So 2025, for that reason, you should think of it as more of a normal year, if you will, where typical cost-sharing seasonality will drive lower MCRs in the first half of the year and higher MCRs in the back half of the year. And we would expect the stop loss MCRs to have more of a level cadence over the course of 2025. In addition to that, there are some dynamics unique to Evernorth. For example, the VillageMD and the stranded overhead that I made reference to are more first half weighted. So they serve to depress the Evernorth income a bit on a year-over-year basis compared to the 2024 pattern. But again, the stop loss dynamic, I think is the most important point as you reflect on the seasonality of our expected earnings. Ben Hendrix : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. You may ask your question. George Hill : Yeah, good morning guys. Two more quick ones, I guess, to close it out on stop loss. Number one, Brian, are there any other considerations on the stop loss margin recovery besides price, as it relates looking at the \u201826 or \u201827 that we should be meaningfully thinking about? Like, are there benefit design or kind of breakpoint levers that get pulled here that get you guys back? And then the second one is, you talked about high acuity surgical activity. I'd be interested if you could comment on whether this is elective versus non-elective, and if there's any particular procedure types you would call out. A - Brian Evanko : Morning, George. It's Brian. So on the first question in terms of the stop loss recovery and are there other factors, to the comment I made earlier, given these are integrated client offerings, the stop loss is just one component of the conversation that we have when we go and renew with clients. And as a result of that, it is not just a price conversation. It's a total relationship conversation that we tend to have. And it's not uncommon for a client to say I want to move my pooling points or my attachment points up to reflect the cost inflation that's happened over time, which helps to mitigate the budget outlay for the employer client. So those types of dynamics often do work their way into the renewal conversations. And I made reference to earlier, we have decades of experience with this business and have shown during times of both good and bad, the ability to keep persistency at strong levels with the employer clients that choose our stop loss offerings. On the high acuity surgical activity that we saw specifically, it was a little more tilted toward inpatient. And as David and I both commented, a little bit more cancer driven and cardiac driven, which we don't necessarily see correlating with elective procedures. And broadly speaking, our planning assumptions for 2025 are for the high cost claimant activity we saw in \u201824 to continue. So we see it as more of a structural shift than something that's temporary. And in the scenario where that assumption is incorrect and it is temporary, then that will offer some upside to the outlook that we've provided here this morning. But we don't see it as heavily correlated to electives. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani : Thanks. I'll be brief. First and foremost, thanks for joining our call and, of course, for your questions today. A few headlines just to reinforce as we wrap up. Against the backdrop of what is indisputably a dynamic and challenging environment, we're confident in our ability to deliver EPS commitment for 2025 of at least $29.50 and remain convicted and committed to our long term growth algorithm of 10% to 14%. We also continue to focus with our specific actions on further improving the healthcare ecosystem and delivery system, and supporting our customers and patients with greater value, greater support, and expanding transparency for the benefit of all we serve. And lastly, before I close, I want to express my personal appreciation and recognition to our colleagues across the globe. We have about 70,000 colleagues that wake up every day to make a positive difference in customers' and patients' lives and, by and large, do that each and every day. And we're going to further strengthen our ability to make a difference for those who have yet even higher needs or at times we may fall short on, but a sincere appreciation to our colleagues. Thank you, and we look forward to furthering our conversation in the future. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Cigna Group's fourth quarter 2024 results review.
