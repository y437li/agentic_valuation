Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Emerson\u2019s Investor Conference Call. During today\u2019s presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. (Operator Instructions) This conference is being recorded today, February 4, 2014. Emerson\u2019s commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements including the company\u2019s outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson\u2019s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Patrick Fitzgerald, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead. Patrick Fitzgerald - Director, Investor Relations : Thank you, Ron. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call will summarize Emerson\u2019s first quarter 2014 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson\u2019s website at emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next three months. I will start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on Page 2 of the conference call slide presentation. Sales increased 1% in the quarter to $5.6 billion, with underlying sales up 3% as the economic environment reflected slowly improving market conditions. Demand among industries and geographies was mixed, but favorable overall with a better business climate in Europe and emerging markets growth of 7%. Gross profit and business segment margin reflected solid improvement. One-time corporate items related to accelerated charitable contributions and acquisition costs increased expenses by about $50 million. Earnings per share of $0.65, increased 5% or up 8% to $0.67 excluding the acquisition costs. Cash generation was strong with operating cash flow up 8% supporting the repurchase of 4.6 million shares. It was a solid start for 2014 with execution from several strategic priorities. Next slide, P&L summary. As I noted, reported sales increased 1% and underlying sales decreased 3%. Gross profit margin expanded 20 basis points excluding one-time acquisition costs related to the previously announced Virgo and Enardo transactions. Higher SG&A expense reflects a $30 million accelerated charitable contribution that was offset by related tax benefits, such that earnings per share was essentially neutral. Acquisition costs and charitable contributions impacted EBIT margin about 90 basis points. The tax rate was lower from the contribution benefit and final items from the embedded computing and power transaction. EPS of $0.65, up 5% reflects through repurchase of 4.6 million shares for about $300 million. Next slide, sales by geography. The underlying sales increase of 3% was led by 10% growth in Asia, which includes a 14% increase in China. In other geographies, the U.S. was up 3%, Europe was flat, Latin America declined to 1%, Canada declined 5% and Middle East and Africa grew 9%. Emerging markets were strong across the business segments up 7%. Moving to Slide 5, segment earnings and cash flow. Profitability remained strong across the business segments with 40 basis points of margin improvement. Corporate expense was elevated due to the previously mentioned accelerated charitable contributions of $30 million and acquisition costs of $21 million. Operating cash flow grew 8% reflecting earnings growth and lower working capital investment. Trade working capital as a percent of sales improved 90 basis points led by strong inventory performance. Moving to Slide 6, process management. Process management underlying sales increased 5% with North America up 4%, Asia up 14%, Europe up 3%, Latin America down 10% and Middle East and Africa up 4%. Acquisitions contributed 3% resulting in net sales up 8%. The sustained strength in the oil, gas, power and chemical industries continued to drive growth, which was led by a near double digit increase in the systems and the solutions business, which was particularly strong in China. North America accelerated with the U.S. up 6% while project timing caused the decline in Latin America sales where orders increased at a double digit rate. Process automation markets continue to support elevated investment levels with a robust project pipeline particularly in North America. Next slide Industrial Automation. Industrial Automation underlying sales were flat with North America unchanged, Asia up 9%, Europe down 5%, Latin America up 3%, and Middle East and Africa up 18%. Industrial goods markets reflected mixed trends with strength in Asia, improvement in North America and softness in Europe. Emerging markets were up high single digits. Growth in the fluid automation motors and drives, electrical distribution and materials joining businesses was offset by weakness in mechanical power transmission markets. Sales in the power generating alternators business were flat with stable but sluggish markets. Market conditions are expected to slowly improve as demand recovery and favorable comparisons support a modest growth outlook. Moving to Slide 8, Network Power, Network Power underlying sales increased 2% with North America up 1%, Asia up 2%, Europe up 1%, Latin America up 8%, and Middle East and Africa up 27%. The embedded computing and power divestiture and currency translation deducted 13% for reported sales down 11%. Strong demand for global telecommunications infrastructure and steady data center market conditions drove the growth. Emerging markets were up double digits led by Latin America and Middle East and Africa. Telecommunications end markets were supported by 4G network investments globally. Data center investment growth in Asia and Europe was offset by slower demand in the Americas. Profit margin declined primarily due to a $13 million one-time research and development credit in the prior year. Market conditions are expected to be favorable in the near-term supported by recovery in Europe and momentum in Asia. Next slide, Climate Technologies, Climate Technologies underlying sales increased 5% with North America down 1%, Asia up 13%, Europe up 5%, Latin America up 9% and Middle East and Africa up 6%. Growth was supported by the global refrigeration market recovery and stable air conditioning markets. U.S. sales were mixed with double digit growth in temperature controls, weakness in service and flat demand in air conditioning after mid-teens growth in the prior year. Growth in China exceeded 20% with strength in air conditioning and refrigeration businesses. Europe improved as well. Orders accelerated to 8% growth in the quarter led by Asia and Europe. Growth momentum is expected to be led by global refrigeration markets along the continued strength in the air conditioning business. Moving to Slide 10, Commercial & Residential Solutions, Commercial & Residential Solutions net and underlying sales increased 3% with North America up 2%, Asia up 11%, Europe up 6%, Latin America up 6% and Middle East and Africa up 4%. Residential investment in North America continues to increase steadily which drove growth in the professional tools, food waste disposers and storage business. The wet/ dry vacuums business declined in large part due to high demand in the prior year from Hurricane Sandy. Market conditions are expected to remain solid in the near-term with support from continued North America residential momentum. Next slide 2014 outlook, economic indicators remain mix, but trending slightly favorable as reflected in our underlying orders which have been trending in the 3% to 4% range for several months. We are expecting global macroeconomic tends to remain favorable supported by improved conditions in Europe. Based on current market conditions, our 2014 outlook is unchanged with underlying sales growth of 3% to 5%. Reported sales are expected to change minus 1% to 1% which reflects the embedded computing and power divestiture, completed acquisitions and currency translation. Margins are expected to expand approximately 0.5% with the benefits from portfolio changes and volume leverage partially offset by accelerated strategic investment. Earnings per share excluding goodwill and tax charges are expected to go 4% to 7%. Business segment and other financial metric forecasts will be provided at our annual investor conference next week in Boston. And with that summary of results I\u2019ll turn it over to David Farr. David Farr - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you very much, Pat. First of all I want to thank everybody for joining us today and hopefully you guys won\u2019t get too much snow, I\u2019m looking out my conference room right now, we\u2019ve got plenty of snow fall in here in St. Louis, a nice cold winter, good for the oil and gas industry. First quarter unfolded as we expected. From the standpoint of our financial forecast that we presented in November and will update in details in the investor conference next week in Boston, it happens just like we believe to what happen. We will talk about the incremental investments next week and where they\u2019re going and why this was important and what you\u2019ll see the deal why this was pretty strategic to us and why the timing is right now. I also intend to have five business leaders with me next week, in addition to my talk so we will have the five (business leaders) give a brief update on the key issues they\u2019re seeing both from a business standpoint and the investment profile, give you a chance to give a broader perspective and what\u2019s going across this company. I want to thank all the operational leaders for delivering in the first quarter, a good first quarter with underlying sales actually a little bit over 3% and 3.4% range. Order trends should continue to drive sequentially better sales, better earnings, better margins and growth in the next two quarters. From my perspective we have good start and things are lining up for a very solid year as we talked about back in November and we\u2019ll talk about it next week. New acquisitions are starting off well and will contribute EPS this year even with the normal balance sheet, accounting actions we had to take in the first quarter which is typical with this type of acquisition not unusual there. We\u2019ve done $1.2 billion; we\u2019re still targeting $1.5 billion for the year and with one small divestiture which we hope to get done in the preceding second half of our fiscal year. Operating cash flow and free cash flow was very good in the first quarter on top of last year\u2019s extremely strong first quarter. As I look at it right now we\u2019re targeting somewhere around $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion in operating cash flow and we\u2019ll continue to payback money to our shareholders most likely in the 50% to 60% range this year a little bit under 60% given the fact that we\u2019re doing more acquisitions than we have over the last three years. But overall very good cash flow performance, the balance sheet in very good shape and we had the flexibility and the need or the flexibility, the ability to do what we need to do from acquisitions or investments internally or getting money back to our shareholders. As usual I\u2019ll give you a lot more details on the economic expectations what we see both for the world in 2014 and over the next couple of years and what that means to our various businesses, I go in great detail on obliging. But just give you a little bit perspective right now to taken a long trip around the world with adding a couple of their OC members. As we look at USA right now it is getting slightly better. We see the USA trends improving and we expect pretty good growth in USA this year versus last year. Canada getting a little bit better though, a very slow start, weather is not been very good and but we do expect Canada to have a reasonable growth this year of both as the oil and gas money has happened and if can sort of I get that pipeline going some point down would really help all of our investments up and down, Canada and the Midwest. Europe, European trends continue to improve. Europe was flat in the quarter but all businesses were up except for one which is industrial automation and that\u2019s primarily driven because of the Caterpillar, but everybody else was up and we had a good quarter in Europe, I expect that will continue to gain momentum, I do not expect that to be super-fast growth but improvement growth which will help us in the United States and else will help China, we\u2019ll talk further about that next week. Just coming back to the Middle East also see that Middle East doing well for us right now both in orders and sales and expect Middle East potentially be the strongest growth segment that we have are ordinary this year coming out of Middle East. China had a great start all across all businesses, the order pace was good. Yes, the news coming out of China things are slowing, that\u2019s nothing new. We do expect China to still have a good growth here this year as we see right now and we\u2019ll see how that goes in the next couple of months, but right now everything looks pretty good for us. In total, Asia-Pacific looks pretty good, driven by China and parts of Southeast Asia and hopefully India will hold in there right now as it did \u2013 as the orders show right now. Latin America will be okay growth this year, won\u2019t be as good as last year in my opinion, but still be positive. It\u2019s probably high-single digit. Hopefully that will continue to strengthen. But overall as I unfold the year I like the pace, I like where things are right now. We are making investments. In my opinion all the operational performance was delivered in the first quarter. Basically we talked about \u2013 we laid out in our targets, in our financial plan, so I felt good about it. And I am looking forward to seeing everyone next week in Boston. To help Pat\u2019s job a lot easier, we decided not to give any charts out this year. So it will be really not to decide, which ones we are going to put in and not put in. And so we will have no charts. And so that will be a lot easier for everybody and Pat is dying right now because he is looking forward to that conversation. So I look forward to seeing everybody next week and hopefully you guys will have a reasonable weather for the next couple of days and not get snowed in. So with that, let\u2019s open the floor for questions. And we will see what\u2019s on your guys mind. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. John Inch - Deutsche Bank : Thank you. Good morning Dave. David Farr : Hi John. Frank Dellaquila : Hi John. John Inch - Deutsche Bank : Dave, could you talk a little bit about your emerging market exposures, what you are seeing and maybe exclude China. And the question is sort of how the cadence of emerging market trends played out over the quarter and kind of how you are thinking about it this year? David Farr : Sure. I went through a little bit there. From my perspective right now in the emerging markets, the Middle East looks still pretty good. I was just there, the order pace is good. I expect them to have a good year. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they are not as strongest, fastest in growth rate, high-single digit maybe even getting close to 10%. India is a market I am concerned about and I am factoring in the \u2013 let\u2019s say I think I am looking at Asia being somewhere in the 6% to 8%. I am factoring in basically a challenging year in India. We will see how that performs. I am a little bit concerned about India. Southeast Asia looks pretty good. Obviously the Thailand thing bothers me a little bit. From this perspective our business has not been disrupted yet, but there is a potential chance that it could be disrupted because it gets a little bit more wide spread. Coming back into Latin America, the order pace looks pretty good, we have some delays relative to what\u2019s going on in Mexico because the law changes, which are going to be very good relative to \u2013 for the energy marketplace will be good for us. Debt flow was down relative to sales. Overall I am pretty confident that our Mexican and our Latin American business will be high single digits for the year. Africa is doing okay. Eastern Europe, right now it\u2019s starting to improve, I would say if Europe continues to trend upward then we will see Eastern Europe doing okay this year. So my biggest concern right now on emerging markets would be probably down into deep in the Latin America and the Brazil, Brazil region, Venezuela region and I am also concerned about India at this point in time. But that\u2019s my perspective. China it\u2019s I think the way our businesses will line up I think we\u2019ll do okay in China this year. John Inch - Deutsche Bank : Okay, that makes a ton of sense. David, if we were to look at Network Power, how were margins ex-embedded computing and I am really sort of, is there a way to kind of parse out the margins year-over-year like how did the margins perform ex-embedded, I think you still have kind of this part of that? David Farr : They were still slightly down based on some of the investments and restructuring things we are doing right now. But we are seeing \u2013 with their way where that we thought they would be for the start of this year. We have a lot going on relative to Network Power relative to new products and the changing things like that. So I mean from the margin performance standpoint I am pleased where Network Power is unfolding and holding and but they were still slightly down even we take out the embedded piece. They are in good shape. They had \u2013 orders were positive, sales were positive, Europe was positive, Asia was very positive. So right now I think Network Power is on track to have a much better year than they did last year, which is important for us. John Inch - Deutsche Bank : The fact that you don\u2019t have embedded in the business and you once did low teens margins, is there some dynamic given the fact that I agreed the business is getting better, but there is still a lot of sort of mix questions, right? Some reasons why you don\u2019t think this business over time, so obviously not \u201814 couldn\u2019t get back to kind of a low teens margin? David Farr : I know \u2013 our plan is to get it back in that low teens margin, the 12%, 13%, 14% and 15%, yes, we are. We expect that that\u2019s where we will go. I mean the fundamental today, I mean right now we have significant investments as we are rebuilding in some technologies, we are rebuilding in some global sales positions and technology positions, so we expect that to put your backup in that range. That business fundamentally should be there. John Inch - Deutsche Bank : Got it. Okay, thank you. David Farr : See you next week, John. Operator : Your next question comes from Deane Dray from Citi Research. Please go ahead. Deane Dray - Citi Research : Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. David Farr : Good afternoon, Deane. Deane Dray - Citi Research : Hi, Dave. I was hoping you get expand on your comment on process in the robust pipeline, I know you choose your words carefully and that sounds pretty positive and you highlighted North America maybe just take us in, what are the end markets, what are the customers telling you and when do these turn into revenue? David Farr : From our respective right now in North America, we are starting to see some of the downstream investment from all the strength into oil, the real oil and the gas coming out of the North America. We are starting to see the investments are happening across the southern part of this America and the product is being let go right now. We will start getting some sales late this year as you remember I have said all along our process would be more \u2013 the growth will be a little bit more rear-end loaded, because of some of these projects. So from my perspective right now, our project business both here and the Americas is looking pretty good. Also Asia is still looking very, very good. I think we are going to have another record setting year both on bookings and sales in Asia. And I am pleasantly surprised at the investment profile even coming out of the Middle East in the oil and gas area. So I would expect based on the pipeline we are seeing right now based on the level of activities from the bidding standpoint that we should have a very good process here again this year. Obviously, we are coming up with very high levels and I don\u2019t \u2013 right now, I do not anticipate getting double-digit top line sales, but I expect to have high single-digit type of gross sales out of these guys. But it\u2019s setting up very nicely and obviously we continue to make very good money in profitability and invest a lot in this business too. Deane Dray - Citi Research : Okay, that\u2019s real helpful. And just given all the headlines on some of the Latin America currencies, you all are one of the very few that engages in hedging practices. So this might be a good opportunity just to refresh everyone on the hedging and how perhaps any of the \u2013 any of the major currency swings affect it? David Farr : Yes. I mean, the only hedging we do right now is at the operational level from the standpoint of buying and selling goods, but that\u2019s the sort of transactional that flows in and out. There is not much going on. We don\u2019t hedge a whole lot. I mean, obviously the currency right now the weakness and the real, the Brazilian real is not a good thing. But sometimes we have swings in the quarter, because what happens is a lot of our global contracts in the process in particular are done in dollars and they go back and forth. They true-up by year end, but we are not doing a whole lot of hedging right now, but clearly the weakening in southern currencies are also very disturbing from the standpoint of overall business and what\u2019s going to happen down there. So, that\u2019s why I am more cautious about Latin America than my internal people would be, just put that way. I think to your point there is going to be a concern there. Deane Dray - Citi Research : Understood. We will hear more about that in Boston. David Farr : Take care, Deane. Deane Dray - Citi Research : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse : Hi, thanks. David Farr : Hello, Julian. Are you guys seeing a lot of snow? Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse : Yesterday some, but it\u2019s pretty much gone now. David Farr : Good, good. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse : In terms of the \u2013 you talked about the accelerated investments back in November. David Farr : Yes. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse : And I guess did you see kind of the normal run rate for the year in Q1, because I guess your clean gross margin was up 60 bps, your SG&A to sales extra charitable stuff was flattish. So, it didn\u2019t \u2013 from the outside it wasn\u2019t obvious you had stepped up investments. So, I just wondered if that was something that you had done and you just absorbed it in the operational leverage? David Farr : I would say we did it and we absorbed it in operational leverage, but we also \u2013 it will grow bigger as the year goes on, but we still did pretty good job on actually absorbing some of the start of this investments. And clearly, we got very close to 3.5% underlying sales growth for the quarter. That\u2019s a good number for us. Once we get in that 3.5% range, we do leverage a little bit better, because as we move towards 4%, it\u2019s even better. So, clearly, we are \u2013 the investment dollars will ramp up as the year goes on, Julian and I am hoping that hopefully we will have pretty good leverage as the year goes on too. So maybe a little bit slightly better profitability, but we\u2019ve got to get the sales, that\u2019s key for us right now. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse : Thanks. And then within industrial automation, yes, you have done a lot of restructuring there the last four years or so. The margins were down slightly I guess even with revenues being up, was there anything \u2013 was that because of I don\u2019t know decremental margins within power transmission or was there anything kind of special going on there? David Farr : Nothing special, just some tough mix for the quarter and some of the investments going forward, so I mean that\u2019s little bit of mixed noise, I mean, from quarter-to-quarter that more round, but overall, the profitability of that business should be pretty good again this year as it was last year. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse : Thanks. And then just lastly within your U.S. process business, you reiterated the fact that sales should pickup later in the year from downstream projects. I guess was the 6% growth in the U.S. you saw in the December quarter, was that a surprise, just the base was very, very difficult, but you still grew 6%, I guess even without these projects coming through? David Farr : I would say, it\u2019s probably \u2013 I was pleasantly surprised at how the U.S. did. The U.S. did little bit better than I thought they would. I actually thought we grow a little bit in the quarter in Europe, but we didn\u2019t, but as I look at the first quarter, I was pleasantly surprised in the U.S. I was hoping a little bit of growth out of Europe. I was disappointed in the Latin America, which did not grow on that. And so we saw better growth in the U.S. and not as much growth in Latin America \u2013 no growth in Latin America. So I think those are three surprises I saw in the quarter. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse : Great, thanks a lot. David Farr : You are welcome. Take care. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with MKM Partners. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners : Hi, good afternoon guys. David Farr : Good afternoon Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners : Dave, could you just walk us around the portfolio and give us a sense for how pricing is looking, where you guys are green and where maybe it\u2019s been a little bit tougher? David Farr : The portfolio right now, where everyone would be green, except for I would say network power. Network power with some of the \u2013 we have been \u2013 we are going after some telecom business, the China Mobile build-out is happening right now and we are aggressively going after that business. We want to make sure we protect our installed base there and that is one of the biggest telecom investments you are going to see in China for the next couple of years and we want to make sure we have our adequate fair share of that. So I would say that\u2019s the place that we have had to sharpen our pencil the most around the world. And other than that, pricing is holding in there pretty well right now. We might see a little bit of squeeze if some of the commodity pressure keeps dropping down, but right now from a price cost standpoint, we are in pretty good shape. Would you say so, Frank? Frank Dellaquila : Yes, we were positive for the quarter. And I think we are pretty much on our plan for the year right now. David Farr : Yes. We will give an update here at February as the guys come in for President\u2019s Council, but nothing surprising. I don\u2019t think you are going to see much overall movement positive or negative around. I mean, we might be look I said I think in November slightly positive or slightly negative. We are going to be pretty tight at this one. There is not a lot of movement right now. Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners : Got you. So the pressure or I guess design pressure on your end in embedded or not I am sorry not embedded, network power in China right now plan for the rest of the year as you see it today? David Farr : I would say that we are going to close that a little bit. We will probably end up being a little bit of red there by the end of the year, but it will be less red than it is today. Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners : Got you. Alright, thank you. David Farr : You are welcome. Thank you. I will see you next week hopefully. Operator : Your next question comes from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan with Nomura. Please go ahead. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura: Good afternoon guys. David Farr : Good afternoon Shannon. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura: Hey. So Dave, I mean you clearly sound more positive on Europe, I mean I know it was only flat in the quarter, but things seem to be getting better there, how positive does the turn kind of in capital investment plans feel there and how much you think Europe could actually grow? David Farr : I am going to talk about that next week, but right now, my gut tells me that we are not looking for a big turn, I am looking probably for Europe in the 1% to 2% type of growth range for us. I look at the GFI by growing 2% to 3% type next year. I mean, as the trend lines continue to improve, clearly we need to get it towards that 2% range or the 3% range in GFI to help us little bit more, but I was pleasantly surprised where I am hearing in Europe from our customer base and also from our own guys internally. And that\u2019s going to be very important from my perspective, the way I would see the world is China, if Europe starts growing again and output and you are going to see China be helped and then you will see us be helped and so the U.S. helped. So I think that\u2019s a key thing and the world doing well next year if Europe stalls. And I think you will see the global economy stall again. And I think Europe is going to be the key driver of this thing. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura: Okay. And on process in terms of this pipeline, the pickup in the second half of \u201814 that you have been talking about, what\u2019s the tail like on that accelerated growth once it starts going? I mean, how long is this pipeline going to run when we started to think into \u201815 plus? David Farr : If the pipeline actually gets built and they started actually flowing the oil down to the \u2013 into the Southern part of the United States then you could see for many years being like two, three, four years a pretty significant build out of what I would call downstream type of businesses across Louisiana and the Texas and Oklahoma region. People talk about there is only 50 new jobs because of the pipelines, but that isn\u2019t taking into consideration that if you build that pipeline and you have that steady stream of oil coming just like the gas pipelines that are being built right now the manufacturing and downstream production will happen in that region and we will have a lot of \u2013 lot more high paying jobs. First of all, to build those factories and secondly to operate those factories and those are skilled jobs when you are looking at be a refining or chemical or whatever type of process you are looking at those are pretty good jobs. And those ones that will come down the road that will be more in the 2015, 2016 time range. So it would be very positive. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura: Okay, great, thanks. See you next week. David Farr : Alright thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Hi, good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon Steve, did you make the show in New York, the HVAC or was it more too cold so you couldn\u2019t call it HVAC (indiscernible)? Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: I made it. I saw your guys there. Yes, some good technology, good technology. David Farr : Was it a heating show or air conditioning show? Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: When I walked across town about five blocks in the snow I was wishing it was a heating show but it was pretty cold so. But back to business on network power, so could you just give us the embedded, the actual embedded sales and profit you booked in the quarter I am just \u2013 I am having hard time understanding what you mean by the margin was still down a little bit ex-embedded did you \u2013 does that mean down a little bit ex-embedded stripping it out of the first quarter of \u201913 as well or down from the 7.2%, just wondering what the run rate is in the second quarter here? David Farr : We going to give it to you right now, hold still. Frank Dellaquila : When you \u2013 Steve this is Frank. Hand on one second here. David Farr : This is because I am not going to give anybody any charts, so we are going to give you actual numbers. This is the trade off so (indiscernible) and because no one gets charts start, you get this information because you get this information no one gets chart so. Frank Dellaquila : So it raises the margin for both \u201813 and \u201814 when you strip it out of both years, but the delta actually gets a little bit worse, maybe a little bit worse. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: What were sales last year in the...? Frank Dellaquila : It was essentially breakeven sales last year. We booked about $350 million. This year closer to $150 million. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay, so $150 million at breakeven? Frank Dellaquila : Yes, basically yes. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay so it\u2019s like a lowest like mid-7%, low to mid-7% type margin. Am I doing math right Frank Dellaquila : When you strip it out yes, no it\u2019s a little higher than that. David Farr : It\u2019s like approximately what? Frank Dellaquila : It\u2019s about 8%. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay, 8%. Now the seasonality here, Dave as I move through the year I mean historically at least in the last several years it\u2019s been kind of like first and second quarter even and then you kind of see a little bit of a ramp in the second half. I mean is that how we think about the second quarter margin for these guys kind of in that similar range? David Farr : Yes, I think across all of Emerson our seasonal pattern is pretty similar. We \u2013 the first quarter is our weakest. Then second gets a little bit better and then third and then fourth. Sometimes third is even better than fourth, but third and fourth clearly we are always the second \u2013 just the way our customer base is and the way \u2013 and the type of channel we have here that\u2019s the way it is. So it\u2019s going to be first, second, third, fourth I would say that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to go \u2013 improvement. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay. And then sequentially on the total sales for next quarter I guess last several years you have been kind of a high-single digit sales number obviously you have some headwind from embedded. So just for total Emerson kind of mid-single digit sequential sales increase first to second quarter, is that the right seasonality? David Farr : No I think right now we are looking at more would be if we did about \u2013 we are going to be in the fours I would say. I think right now the order \u2013 and the pattern is pretty important to us. January was not a great month for anybody as you have been hearing everywhere I mean that we lost so many \u2013 we lost lot of days. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: How bad was January, was it down? David Farr : I mean in January \u2013 we lost several days. I mean I don\u2019t know exact numbers right now. It\u2019s just anecdotal to me. But it is not I mean it was because we lost 2 or 3 days and so a lot of businesses. And so I would expect and our customers did too. So I expect if this weather stays up like this there as a lot of people losing today again too. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay what \u2013 sorry go ahead. David Farr : Yes, so I would expect we are going to be \u2013 I mean the numbers I am looking at right now for the quarter I would be looking at 4%, 4.5% range for underlying sales growth. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: For underlying year-over-year sales growth for the total company? David Farr : Correct. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: And then one last quick one just on China, I know you have got some dynamics around process and network power, but I guess in this kind of a general industrial you are seeing in China, there has been a bit of an uptick for a couple of peers I think Siemens and Rockwell talked about it. It doesn\u2019t appear that, that economy is getting like materially better. Is that a \u2013 is there \u2013 are there some stocking dynamics going on there do you think, is there \u2013 how do you think about just kind of like general industrial demand in China? David Farr : Our general industrial business was very \u2013 it was very strong in the quarter both in \u2013 I mean we\u2019re strong across the board in China in sales and orders in the first quarter. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan:  It\u2019s got. David Farr : It was very weak \u2013 it\u2019s been very weak for about 18 months, the Climate guys started leading out if you remember correctly last year late. And so we\u2019re starting to see \u2013 it\u2019s not a channel building here because this is not a channel business, that much of business for us. We\u2019re seeing pretty much a lot of the people starting to invest, continue to invest in the productivity, they\u2019ve got the capacity right-sized. And so right now I just came back from meeting with all my agents that we saw a very good first quarter, we\u2019re still \u2013 we still feel very good about the second quarter. So we see orders and we see a good quarter in the second quarter in China then I might feel very good about the year there. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay, great. Thanks. David Farr : You\u2019re welcome. Take care. Operator : Your next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : Hi, good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon, Rich. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : Two quick ones on process the margin was pretty good this quarter and last quarter Dave you talked about MRO potentially picking up in North America. Did that come through maybe earlier than expected? David Farr : We saw some good \u2013 we did see some good MRO in the quarter, yes we did. And I mean I don\u2019t have the full analyzing, I don\u2019t have to do every quarter, but I would say that, that also tells me we could have a lot of big projects flown through there either at this point in time. So we had a lot of MRO. So it was just overall, it was a good mix, it was a right mix for us, sometimes you get lucky but I would say MRO came especially since we saw North America do well too. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : Alright. So the way to think about it going forward is the mix probably gets a little less favorable? David Farr : I would say so. As we go into the second half this year we\u2019re going to start seeing some more \u2013 I would see some more margin squeeze, we\u2019ll still do okay for the year I mean we\u2019ll still do very well for the margin to the year but I would say that we could see some squeeze. And the other thing going for us too is we\u2019re going to have \u2013 we\u2019re going to have some good growth in acquisitions we make through which are very good help us there too. So it\u2019s going to be an interesting dynamic, I expect pretty good things in our process this year. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. And then in network with UPS in North America has been pretty tough at for a while now based on your order commentary and the results. What are the dynamics there, what are you seeing out there competitively I mean it doesn\u2019t sound like anybody is knocking the cover off the ball, but how do you think this plays out over the course for the next 12 to 18 months in terms of growth? David Farr : I think we and our competitors are going to start seeing a better market dynamic in the UPS here. We are \u2013 we\u2019re actually seeing the orders now and as the UPS is a little bit longer lead-time because of big systems. So I was in Italy, I saw that the pipeline there and not prudent with the pipeline here in North America. So I think you\u2019re going to see UPS which had been weak for the last \u2013 you are right the last 18 months for all of us, you\u2019re going to start seeing better investments. We\u2019re actually seeing better UPS business outside the United States right now because a lot of big \u2013 some projects being done outside the United States by some of the big datacenters so the cloud datacenters. Right now based on the pipeline and based on order pace I think you\u2019re going to start see in North America UPS do better. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay, great. See you next week. David Farr : You\u2019re welcome. See you next week. Look forward to it. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Hi, good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon, Steven. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Nice to hear you speaking positively about manufacturing in the U.S. resurgence whether it\u2019s a pipeline or anything else? David Farr : You know I\u2019m a very proud America guy. I\u2019m from the Midwest. We\u2019re very positive people out here. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Excellent. So.. David Farr : And won the World Series. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Well it\u2019s always next year, right? David Farr : Thank you very much. I appreciate that opportunity. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : So can you just talk a little bit about acquisitions and your strategy I mean you did Virgo, Enardo, those obviously give you quite a lot of additional capability. Should we be thinking about this on a more aggressive basis going forward? David Farr : No, I mean as I said we\u2019re going to probably do another $300 million this year. We would like to do \u2013 we\u2019d like to stay focused on this $1 billion to $1.5 billion type of bolt-on type acquisitions over the next couple of years. As I talk about next week that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to talk about, we\u2019re going to be looking at level type acquisitions. These are ones that we\u2019re quoting, these are ones we\u2019re working, the timing is not always \u2013 we don\u2019t drive the timing, we work it hard, but that\u2019s a tough acquisition we\u2019re going to do, we\u2019re going to do, we did one in Network Power, a nice solutions service type business there. We did a couple of acquisitions and the process in the first quarter. So you\u2019re going to see us through those in process, some in Network Power, some in Industrial Automation, and some in Climate along those type of things, nothing real big, maybe ranging anywhere from $30 million up to the $500 million range, that\u2019s our focus plan right now. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Okay, great. I know you talked about January before a little bit on weather, but if you think about the PMIs that you\u2019re actually starring at coming out recently obviously for U.S. but elsewhere too. I mean are you as confident I mean is there anything that sort of impacted your confidence level in that, are you just saying what we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re seeing in our portfolio so it\u2019s got to be weather and move on and we\u2019ll get better in a couple of months. So how are you thinking about that, Dave? David Farr : Well the numbers that came out yes it didn\u2019t surprise me because we had all the business leaders last week and we all \u2013 we had heard \u2013 we run a four, four, five type of company or a four, four, five and a half that means we close up to four weeks in a month. We already knew that January is going to be like from the business there. So we lost days in North America, we lost days around the world sounds like because of the weather. So the numbers didn\u2019t surprise me and I mean our customers are still optimistic. What we\u2019re seeing is still very positive. So I think that they will come back. If the weather stays like this for the next couple of months you\u2019ll lose some more floppiness and obviously make February, March much harder, but so right now I feel pretty good. The China numbers didn\u2019t surprise me at all I mean given where the Chinese New Year fell and what\u2019s going on with \u2013 the government is trying to play around the shadow banking a little bit, trying to play it a little bit. But overall I mean my customer base in China is still pretty positive. So.. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. David Farr : Nothing surprising there. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. And maybe just before I go, if you just address quickly than what you\u2019re seeing in terms of non-res momentum and you mentioned the Power Transmission side as well? David Farr : The non-res, the inquiry \u2013 the things we\u2019re hearing in the United States relative to non-res construction are positive. We haven\u2019t seen a lot of order pace shed on it. We\u2019re seeing a lot of inquiries; we\u2019re seeing a lot of planning around it. And so even from our perspective today we went to our Board on two North America non-res construction that will unfold as the year unfolds and goes into next year. So I think that all that have kept our capacity real low, we\u2019ve worked it down in fact we\u2019ve taken it down after the \u201808 crash and now we\u2019re starting to work it back again. So I think it\u2019s going to unfold here. I think non-res will start ticking up, it\u2019s not going to be a exposure, but I think it\u2019s going to pickup as year goes on. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Alright. I see you next week. Thanks, Dave. David Farr : See you next week. Take care. Steven, bye. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead. Scott Davis - Barclays: Hi, good afternoon guys. David Farr : Good afternoon, Scott. Scott Davis - Barclays: Dave, is this the portfolio you have that you\u2019re going to ride for the year I mean is this \u2013 are you fairly committed to what you have I mean just reading your annual report it seems like this is \u2013 this is the \u2013 this is the game plan, is that accurate? David Farr : That\u2019s accurate except for one small divesture this year, that\u2019s what we ride this year right now and I mean particular interest in getting North America in particular the U.S. to strengthen improvement and then I think we\u2019ll talk about next week that I have \u2013 we have plans that in the next couple of years that we would most likely see $1 billion to $1.5 billion type of divestitures. So you\u2019ll see that talk about that next week. Scott Davis - Barclays: Okay. Fair enough. And then on the strategic investments, are these long \u2013 I mean what\u2019s the mix of kind of long-term, short term projects I mean when I think about ERP systems and things like that they tend to last three or four years. But are a lot of the strategic investments you made things that we could be fairly confident to be over with in 2014? David Farr : I think you\u2019re going to see us \u2013 so many of these things are going to last up two to three years that the type of investment period we\u2019re seeing here. We\u2019ll talk \u2013 I\u2019ll talk about it how you\u2019re going to see a little bit of tweaking up in a couple of areas and you\u2019ll see the numbers and we\u2019ll talk about those. But all of them will start paying back in my opinion as we leave this year and start getting into next year and particular ones in some of the service side that we\u2019re investing and some of the technology sides we\u2019re investing. Those will payback much faster than let\u2019s say the Oracle type investments or a custom interface and type stuff I mean so the majority of the investments we\u2019re talking about are going to be ones that will start paying back late this year and start \u2013 be in this next year a little bit too. So it will be self funding here as it goes on. Scott Davis - Barclays: Okay, great. And then just a quick follow-up and sorry if you already answered this question. But in the alternator business we\u2019ve had several quarters of inventory destock. Is that pretty much done at this point? David Farr : We\u2019re going sideways right now, yes. Scott Davis - Barclays: Okay, okay, see you next week. David Farr : See you next week. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Langenberg with Langenberg and Company. Please go ahead. Brian Langenberg - Langenberg and Company : Thank you. Hey, Dave. David Farr : Good afternoon, Brian. Brian Langenberg - Langenberg and Company : Afternoon. Just want to ask the same question a slightly different way, it\u2019s an analyst thing with Europe? David Farr : I think I can answer the same way. Go ahead. Brian Langenberg - Langenberg and Company : No, you can\u2019t. You have to answer them differently. With Europe, obviously it\u2019s a big place, dive a little bit deep here, talk about the short cycle versus maybe capital spending driven? And then the second part of this is there is somebody doing something in Europe for Europe and there is in Europe for someplace else. So the best that you can maybe talk about what you have been seeing in Europe in that way and color the commentary that way, if you would? David Farr : Okay. So, the first question is on short cycle, long cycle. The short cycle business is I mean, I would say, right now is what\u2019s really driving us at this point in time. The longer cycle business is just starting to unfold as I see it, it\u2019s early days. We are starting just the order pace we see it coming as the activity. People talking about it \u2013 coming at it, so right now, what\u2019s been driving this shorter cycle type of stuff, MRO business or some of the consumer or light industrial stuff and that\u2019s been driving us here a little bit. I expect the longer cycle stuff in order for our year to unfold and I am talking 3% to 5%, with 3.5% in the first quarter underlying growth and I am talking over 4% in the second quarter. We are expecting some of that longer cycle stuff to start kicking in for us. And Europe right now, we have actually seen some of the Europe \u2013 outside Europe improving. Europe for Europe has not improved as much, but Europe for outside Europe is starting to improve and that\u2019s a good sign. And so from my perspective, if the economic numbers in underlying GDP or gross fixed investment continue to improve, you are going to see \u2013 then you will start seeing investments in Europe for Europe. Italy is still a concern for us. The southern part of the country, Europe is still concerned, France is we haven\u2019t seen much recovery in France yet, but there is enough going on in Europe right now that for the exporting kind of businesses that\u2019s a good sign. And if China continues to improve, then you will see that will help us too. Brian Langenberg - Langenberg and Company : Got it. Thank you. David Farr : You are welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Wood with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys. This is Adam in for Mike. Just a quick one here. Are you seeing any impact\u2026 David Farr : You changed the name Mike on to Adam. Unidentified Analyst : Yes me. Just a quick one, are you seeing any impact from credit issues for kind of the small or medium sized customers in China. I know it\u2019s something that has sort of come up before and seem to be resolved fairly quickly? David Farr : We haven\u2019t seen it. Yes, I was talking to the guys about it. They are definitely, even though, we had a very good month and quarter on receivables, the receivable issue in China is still there. They are very slow paying, but they are getting access to money. It got a little tighter a couple of quarters ago, but it seems unfolding a little bit right now. And I think the government is trying very carefully to figure out how to rein this down slowly without totally crushing things, but right now, it\u2019s okay. But the receivable is definitely spread out a little bit and that\u2019s something we will be working pretty hard. We don\u2019t have much, in a company bad debt \u2013 the company the size of our bad debt in any year is about $7 million. Frank Dellaquila : $10 million. David Farr : $10 million. So we don\u2019t have much, but it\u2019s \u2013 at this time, I am going to watch very closely here. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thanks a lot guys. David Farr : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeremy Capron with CLSA. Please go ahead. Jeremy Capron - CLSA: Good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon Jeremy. Jeremy Capron - CLSA: Question on pricing, could you talk about pricing across your businesses, I mean industrial automation and network power margins are down, I am wondering if there is anything related to pricing here and then more generally across the other business platforms as well? David Farr : Yes. As I mentioned earlier, Jeremy, the pricing across our businesses right now in this quarter was pretty good. Everyone was slightly positive. We look at the price cost is green across the whole company. And then if you look at network power, it was \u2013 it\u2019s more of a mix issue. We have gone after, but strategically we want to make sure we play in the rollout of China Mobile with the 4G. And the other thing is that we have some new product coming out in North America on our precision cooling platform, a much broader platform that the newer product, which from a cost standpoint is a little bit high and we don\u2019t have our costs quite in line yet with what the selling price is. So, there is a little bit of squeeze there, but it\u2019s more of a mix thing in network power at this point in time. That\u2019s where it is. It\u2019s pretty good and I expect to be decent for the year for us. Jeremy Capron - CLSA: Great. And then can we go back to the alternators business, you are talking about a stabilization here. I\u2019m wondering could you comment on the extent of the decline that you\u2019ve experienced here over the past year or so? David Farr : We\u2019ve not given those numbers out, the magnitude, but that is quite significant of the numbers. And I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll I mean we\u2019ll pull something together if you\u2019re going to be there next week we\u2019ll probably talk about it a little bit. I don\u2019t want to give you a number off the top of my head right here, but it\u2019s not something but I won\u2019t go talk about either. Jeremy Capron - CLSA: Okay. Thanks very much. David Farr : We can give you a general feel. It\u2019s quite significant. Let\u2019s put this way, it\u2019s got two in front of it. Jeremy Capron - CLSA: Great. Thank you. David Farr : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity : Hi, good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon, John. John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity : So two quick questions. First, in Network Power, can you talk about how demand was in the sort of office LAN environment, I know you\u2019ve talked about datacenter pretty well, but can you talk about that LAN opportunity? And then, secondly within Climate Technologies in the U.S., if you could just talk about the dynamics of that field services business and when we should see that rebound? Thanks. David Farr : Yes, on the LAN side I can\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t have that type of deal. What I would do is I\u2019ll talk to Scott Barbour be there this weekend. We will be webcasting, so why don\u2019t we find out little bit, give a little color on that \u2013 on the length because I can\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t want to make something up, John, some people accuse me of making things up that I don\u2019t want to do it. Now relative to Climate Technology in the service side I think the key issue there is we just \u2013 we\u2019ve seen our \u2013 unbelievably weak replacement type of marketplace right now. People are either putting whole new systems in and they work on the heating system because we\u2019ve just not seen much turnover year that we\u2019ve seen a very weak replacement. And so I would expect we would see an improvement when the spring comes that people \u2013 they\u2019re going to evaluate, do we put a whole new system in or do you repair. If your heating went out which we saw a lot of people here in St. Louis in early heat wave, a lot of heaters went out, they replaced a whole system, there wasn\u2019t repaired going no. So I\u2019m hoping that we\u2019ll see at this spring, we\u2019ll see a recovery in that repair cycle, a very nice part of our business which has been down for almost a year and a half and maybe two years now and so its proper side of our business there too. So that\u2019s our current feel, we don\u2019t have anything better than that at this point in time. John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity : Great. Thank you. David Farr : Take care, John. Operator : Your next question comes from Jamie Sullivan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets : Good afternoon and thanks. David Farr : Good afternoon, Jamie. Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets : So maybe just to follow-on to that question. Just more generally about Climate in the U.S. were some of those puts and takes. How you\u2019re kind of thinking about those dynamics for the year with you mentioned AC flat, field service was feeling some pressure. It sounds like you might improve in this spring, maybe just more broadly in the U.S. how you\u2019re thinking about Climate? David Farr : Broadly in Climate U.S., I feel we have a good year. I mean on the AC side, just look at the AC side, the housing I think you\u2019re going \u2013 the housing continue to be okay, I think it\u2019s been several years now that we have not seen a strong HVAC marketplace in North America. I\u2019m feeling there is going to be a better one this year, inventories are extremely, extremely low right now. On the refrigeration side we\u2019ve seen the marine business pop back which is a good sign. If we actually are correct about non-res picking backup as year progresses you\u2019ll start seeing some of our non-res business improve too and the refrigeration side will improve. The only call on the replacement market will be is that people have the money to spend and they feel like they\u2019re spending the money. They will \u2013 the replacement market will soon come back up. I feel pretty good about Climate Technology in North America this year. I feel good about in Asia, good about in Europe. We\u2019ve had a couple of two flat years in Climate. They are due to have what I call is a solid breakout year because there is still \u2013 we\u2019ll talk a little bit about this through the cycle that is still I believe 5% to 7% underlying growth companies globally and they need to be at the high end of that cycle this year. Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. David Farr : That\u2019s where it is. Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets : And then\u2026 David Farr : Take care, Jamie. See you \u2013 you will be there next week. Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets : I am. Could I squeeze in one last one before we go? David Farr : Well if it\u2019s a decent question yes Jamie I would take it, if it\u2019s not a decent just \u2013 I\u2019m just going to hang up, okay. Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets : Alright, fair enough. David Farr : No pressure, no pressure. Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets : No pressure. So just on the Network Power margin I think you said for the forward year pro forma they\u2019re around 10.5 for 2013. Is that right, I think you said that last quarter? I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about this year relative to that, it sounds like some pressure relative to that? David Farr : Yes. What we\u2019re trying to do is I would expect \u2013 we\u2019re not trying to get much margin improvement this year on Network Power. What I\u2019m trying to do right now is we are making some strategic investments. We are trying to get the business moving on a positive top line basis and I hope a slight improvement in margin, but that is not my focus in this business. We have gone through. We have torn this business apart. We have been making some significant investments. We want this business to have a positive top line. And then I expect if that happens, you will start seeing the margin improvement. And so we are looking at margin, slight margin improvement, that\u2019s the game plan this year, but the game for me is growth. I want some positive growth like we saw in the first quarter. That\u2019s important for me. And the new products are coming off. So that\u2019s why our focus is in that business this year. Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets : Thanks very much. We will see you next week then. David Farr : See you next week, Jamie. You didn\u2019t get the X button, you are lucky. You didn\u2019t ask about Obamacare or something like that, man. Did you get your healthcare plan yet? Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets : I got mine. David Farr : That\u2019s good. Yes, everyone is covering that one too. Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets : Thanks a lot. David Farr - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you everybody. That\u2019s it. I want to thank everybody. I am looking forward to seeing everybody next. Again, the first quarter unfolded like we thought would. We still feel good about the year. We still feel good about the recovery. And I am looking obviously, feeling a little better about a stronger second quarter as a normal progression. Look forward to talking to people next week. And I am looking forward for Pat to talk about why we are not handing any charts out next week. I mean, that should be an interesting conversation. I mean, this will be good sendoff for Pat to figure out how to explain you guys you get no charts, I mean just give them a booklet of blank pages. That\u2019s what I think I would do. Pat, take care. Have a great one. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. Thanks for participating. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Emerson Investor Conference Call. During today\u2019s presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. (Operator Instructions) This conference is being recorded today, May 6, 2014. Emerson\u2019s commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements including the company\u2019s outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson\u2019s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Patrick Fitzgerald, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead sir. Patrick Fitzgerald - Director, Investor Relations : Thank you, Vince. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call will summarize Emerson\u2019s second quarter 2014 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson\u2019s website at emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next three months. I will start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on Page 2 of the conference call slide presentation. Net sales in the quarter decreased 2% to $5.8 billion, with underwriting sales up 2%. Sales were lower than expected primarily due to harsh winter weather and weak GDP growth in the U.S. as well as a slowdown of the global project execution in the process industry. At the same time, process customers proceeded with plans for future investments helping drive total Emerson orders of 9% in the quarter with strong acceleration in March. Gross profit margin expanded 140 basis points to 41.2%, while EBIT margin was unchanged from the prior year as currency volatility affected comparisons by $35 million and the Artesyn Technologies equity investment reported a loss of $34 million. EBIT margin improved 60 basis points excluding the equity loss. GAAP earning per share of $0.77 equaled the prior year. Cash generation was strong overcoming lost cash flow from Artesyn divestiture. Operationally, there is a strong execution in the quarter despite the economic weakness in non-operating items. Moving to Slide 3, P&L summary, as I stated, sales declined 2% and the Artesyn divestiture deducted 5% and acquisitions added 1%, just as underlying sales grew 2%. 140 basis points of gross profit margin improvement is driven by portfolio changes and cost containment. SG&A expense declined in large part due to lower stock compensation expense. Significant restructuring costs in the Artesyn investment contributed to an equity loss and other deductions of $34 million. Additionally, currency volatility swung from gains in the prior year, but losses in the second quarter for a change of $35 million. Reported EBIT margin was flat or up 16 basis points due to an equity loss. 3.3 million shares were repurchased for $214 million, such that earnings per share of $0.77 was unchanged from prior year. Next slide, sales by geography. By region, underlying sales grew in the U.S. by 3%, Europe by 1%, Asia by 4% which includes China growth of 9%, Latin America by 3% and Canada by 2%. Middle East and Africa declined 9% affected by robust growth in the prior year quarter. Total underlying sales increased 2%. Strong momentum continued in China where all business segments grew for the third consecutive quarter. Moving to Slide 5, business segment earnings and cash flow, a 2% decline in business segment EBIT includes $35 million unfavorable impact from currency volatility. Corporate expense reflects the Artesyn equity loss partially offset by lower stock compensation expense. Looking down to cash flow, flat reported results overcame lost operating cash from Artesyn divestiture. Higher capital expenditures reflected ongoing growth and productivity investments. Trade working capital improvement improved due to strong inventory and payables performance. Next slide Process Management, Process Management underlying sales grew 1% with North America up 6%, Asia down 1% which includes China up 5%, Europe up 4%, Latin America down 3% and Middle East and Africa down 14%. Acquisitions added 4% and currency translation deducted 1%, but net sales growth up 4%. Growth momentum continued in energy and chemical industries with more cautious project implementations by customers slowed sales growth. U.S. strength drove growth in North America with growth in Europe led by North Sea project activity. Asia declined as softness and difficult comparisons in India and Australia offset 5% growth in China. Middle East and Africa witnessed reflected ongoing political instability in the region. The decline in margin was primarily due to currency volatility that lowered earnings by $31 million. Orders increased 12% led by unconventional upstream oil and gas projects. The robust orders growth reinforced continued strength in process automation markets particularly in North America. Moving to Slide 7, Industrial Automation, Industrial Automation net and underlying sales grew 2% with North America up 1%, Asia up 6% including China up 18%, Europe flat, Latin America up 7% and Middle East and Africa up 1%. Demand improved for capital goods especially in emerging markets. Asia growth was led by China where mature markets were slower. Modest growth in the fluid automation, motors and drives, electrical distribution and hermetic motors businesses offset modest declines in the mechanical power transmission and power generating alternators businesses. Orders growth accelerated to a high single digit rate in the quarter led by double digit growth in power generating alternators. The order strength supports the expectation for improved growth in the second half with acceleration in the U.S. and Europe. Next slide, Network Power, Network Power underlying sales increased 1% with the U.S. up 2%, Asia up 4% including China up 6%, Europe down 3%, Latin America down 8% and Middle East and Africa flat. The Artesyn divestiture deducted 21% and currency translation deducted 1% where net sales declined 21%. Growth was solid in telecommunications markets led by U.S. and Europe with China and India also up. Demand for datacenter technologies remained slow overall as growth in Asia and North America was offset by weakness in Europe and Latin America. The margin expansion reflects the Artesyn divestiture benefit partially offset by strategic investment programs. High-single digit orders growth reflects improving global market conditions especially in Europe. Gradual recovery in datacenter markets is expected to continue with the outlook for modest growth unchanged. Next slide, Climate Technologies, Climate Technologies underlying sales increased 6% with North America up 2%, Asia up 11% including China up 14%, Europe up 3%, Latin America up 46% and Middle East and Africa down 4%. The global refrigeration business was strong particularly in transportation along with modest growth in air conditioning markets. U.S. sales were strongest in the temperature sensors business, up double digits with the residential air conditioning up mid single digits and commercial up low single digits. Strong demand in China drove Asia led by the refrigeration solutions and sensors businesses. Europe market conditions continued to improve. Order trends remain steady led by strong growth in Europe, global refrigeration markets are expected to remain strong along with improving market conditions in the U.S. Moving to Slide 10, Commercial & Residential Solutions, Commercial & Residential Solutions net and underlying sales increased 1% with North America down 1%, Asia up 18%, including China up 23%; Europe, up 10%; Latin America, down 7%; and Middle East and Africa, up 23%. The strong growth in international markets offset weakness in the U.S. related to the harsh winter weather. Growth was led by the professional tools, wet/dry vacuums and food waste disposers businesses. Profitability in the segment remains very strong. Orders growth acceleration in the quarter reflects recovery from the weather impact. U.S. residential and commercial construction markets are expected to improve supporting stronger growth in the second half. Next slide, 2014 outlook, robust orders growth in the quarter reflects continued improvement in the global macroeconomic environment. Large multi-year industrial projects and recovering demand for capital goods helped drive order strength. At the same time, uncertainty persisted in some markets as reflected in the anemic U.S. GDP growth in the first calendar quarter. Recovery appears underway based on March orders with preliminary trailing three-month orders growth in April are approximately 8%. Based on current market, the 2014 outlook is unchanged with underlying sales growth of 3% to 5%, reported sales change of minus 1% to 1% reflecting the embedded computing and power divestiture, completed acquisitions and currency translation, margin expansion of approximately 0.5%, excluding charges in the prior year and equity loss in the current year, and reported earnings per share of $3.60 to $3.80, up 4% to 7% excluding impairment and repatriation charges in the prior year. And with that, I will turn over to David Farr. David Farr - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you very much, Pat. Thank you everybody for joining us today. I appreciate it. First, I want to also thank (Technical Difficulty) this quarter with solid margin improvement, strong cash flow making up for the cash we lost from the sale of embedded and then also pressing forward on the strong internal growth initiatives, both in the service area, solutions areas and technology to try to drive longer term growth across our Emerson businesses. Yes, the quarter sales were much weaker than we anticipated in February as we met in Boston, snowy Boston based primarily on a much weaker U.S. residential marketplace for us. As I look at the various markets from what we saw in February to what actually finished at the end of the March quarter, Europe was stronger, China was stronger, India weaker, Middle East weaker, Latin America weaker, primarily because of Brazil and a little bit slowdown in Mexico with the election and the changes in the energy programs. In addition, we saw with the quarter of being much weaker, just from the general economics view around the world, we saw some of our large \u2013 our large process industrial customers really start slowing down with the execution of the projects that we have underway, not canceling, but just slowing them down and pushing them out. In fact, orders have continued to be strong, so that the confidence is there in our customer base, they are just slowing it down. As we look at the late March and April orders on a per day basis, because there are several days moving back and forth with the Easter and the Easter holiday and the various holidays this year. On average right now, we are growing underlying orders around this 8%, 9% high single-digit basis. So, we had April again looking at pretty good orders. Again, this is the third month as I look at orders trending upwards. And so I think that the key thing for us right now is orders have turned. We now clearly need to continue to execute and delivering at the high level backlog we have right now and drive down the backlog and deliver those sales in the second half of the year. Again, just stepping back and thinking about the markets that we have faced today versus February when we talked about them the one real negative is that U.S. residential marketplace is much, much weaker than we saw back in February. On the positive side, non-residential continues to solidify and we are actually seeing that look stronger in the second half of this year both here in the United States and other markets around the world. In Europe, I feel better about it, except for the unfortunate situation between the Russia-Ukraine situation and Eastern Europe and potential slowdown impact on Europe, but right now, Europe continues to look better than it did originally in trending the way you want to trend. And if you look at the world, it has been a very, very muted global economic recovery coming out 2008, 2009 recovery. Not much of the typical recovery from business or the consumer or the investment profile. As we talked about in February, we are going against this and we are pushing hard both internally. We make it internal investments in technologies. We are making investments right now in our capacity capabilities, our productivity capabilities our new product initiatives. We are pushing our money that we have generated record level of the cash flow into the company to drive higher levels of growth. We have also stepped up our acquisitions in the first couple of months of this year already spending $1.2 billion targeted $1.5 billion and we will continue to push pretty hard that how we can emphasize and increase our acquisitions for external growth going forward here in the next couple of years. Clearly our balance sheet, our operational performance, our cash flow is at the level that we can invest more aggressively to drive growth and push away through this what I call is globally muted recovery as this continues to happen around is from month-to-month. Overall cash flow very good, we are increasing our capital spending this year as you know we are up \u2013 we will be driving close to $800 million of capital, up from less than $700 million last year. Investing in our new products, our innovation, our global capacity utilization areas, investing in productivity and focusing on how we can make the company stronger and drive a more profitable business and try to drive little bit faster growth. So overall, the quarter clearly disappointing from the top line growth, I was pleased with the execution with the operations from profitability and cash flow. And the recovery rather will continue to move forward but at a very, very slow pace. I would not take much. Unfortunately did not back some of the economic recovery and particularly in Europe if we saw situation emerge relative to Russia, Ukraine and whole Eastern Europe. So concerns but at this point in time we are pushing forward our investments and we will continue to push forward our investments to drive better growth, better always the profitability and better returns for our shareholders. We are still targeting to deliver back to our shareholders this year at least 60% of our operating cash flow right now our trend probably is a little bit above 60% unless we see external investments that we see the opportunity coming back, we will keep at that level and so we see the money needed to grow the company faster. With that, we will open the phones for questions and answers. Operator : Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) The first question is from the line of Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead. Scott Davis - Barclays: Hi, good afternoon guys. David Farr : Good afternoon, Scott. Scott Davis - Barclays: Dave you mentioned in your comments this have been a different type or recovery and that I think that\u2019s \u2013 I think we would all agree with that, but based on the order book that you have it seems pretty strong and just the backlog and then you look at it things like process where there is some pretty big projects coming down the pipe, does it feel like to you that we are at the tipping point here where that investments spend is getting ready to really kicking to re-offer the cycle or do you still you feel like that\u2019s vulnerable? David Farr : My discussions with the customer based, the CEOs out there is that we are all starting to push forward and spending more money. I am not alone if you look at our spending pace right now we made the decision a little bit earlier than some of our customers to push forward. Scott, I feel is that that tipping point the one big negative give is also as you saw the situation really unfold in Europe where the European economies really starting to stall again. Then I think you would see the CEOs around the world will be a very cautious again and pull back. But right now I feel significantly more positive about that tipping points coming and that\u2019s for \u2013 therefore we are going to push forward. We are seeing the desire that we would see the core pace but people still will be concerned about the world things happening. And today people can react so much faster than ever before I became CEO back in 2000. Scott Davis - Barclays: So I guess the natural and these are all high class problems I suppose but good natural follow-up on that is just specifically in process, I mean if you look at the projects that have been announced in chemicals and oil and gas, refinery, etcetera. I mean there is a lot, lot of project in that 2015 to 2018 timeframe I mean how do you balance between having a natural level skepticism that a big chunk of them might get cancelled, to the other side of it where you really need to invest pretty heavily to make sure you are there because there could be some \u2013 I would imagine some capacity constraints when you get to that time period, if not in products but in just engineering talent and man power, I mean how do you think about that Dave? David Farr : Right now based on the code activity which is \u2013 continues to be at record levels both in the process world and some of our industrial space too, we are pushing forward. We are going to make \u2013 we are making the investments because I see the order book, I see the projects we are winning. I saw the projects coming down the pipe down this \u2013 again this month. And I feel very confident that these projects will go forward. They may take rather than 18 months to be unfold they might take 24 months, I feel quite strongly they are going to happen because the capacity is needed. I know where this product is going, so I feel they will happen and we have to get out in front of that because we are winning clearly a strong fair share of those orders, well if you look at the order pace coming out of process and the improving industrial for us too. So we have to be ahead of it and that\u2019s what we are doing we are investing. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays: Okay, good. Good luck Dave. I will pass it on. David Farr : You\u2019re welcome. Scott thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citi. Please go ahead. Deane Dray - Citi: Thank you. Good morning everyone or good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon Deane. Deane Dray - Citi: Dave can we go back to you are reaffirming the guidance, but we are well into the second half and you are baking in some second half ramp and especially in process maybe just talk a bit more about within the segments what sort of upside you are expecting how that ramps, is it a question of easier comps or are there some opportunities that are in baked in the second half assumptions? David Farr : On the early cycle businesses the Climate Technology business and the Residential Solutions business some of our early cycle industrial businesses, we are seeing the activity to start picking back up again. So we are expecting them to get a little bit stronger in the second half of the year. Right now, Climate Technologies is still looking at a very good year on a global basis. They have had a good first half. I think we will have \u2013 I think they personally will have a better second half. On the industrial space, the process guys, the Industrial Automation guys, the Network Power guys have the orders. It\u2019s a matter of getting execution around those orders and getting some what I would call incremental book to ship type businesses. Our backlog right now has the capability to deliver in the second half of the year. We need to execute around that backlog and we need some of the early cycle guys, which we are starting to see as we have seen in the last I would say the last 45 days of orders we need to see if those orders go into \u2013 being booked and shipped. And I think that\u2019s where we are coming from right now. Profitability wise, we have the capability right now our cost structure is in good shape, the price costs is in good shape, it\u2019s just the matter of getting that sales booked, which we are and taking the backlog down and then getting out the door. And then I firmly believe going back to the question from the previous person asking based on what I see right now if things are stepping up we are going to see going into 2015 with a strong pace of business for us. Deane Dray - Citi: Great, that\u2019s very helpful. And just to go back on one of the comment you have made on process particularly and maybe just reconcile because it seems a bit contradictory. One, you said some of the customers are pushing out projects, but project implementation is slowing them down. Meanwhile you have seen a pickup in what you call robust order growth are these separate parts, separate end markets within process or it would seem that you wouldn\u2019t see the same customers making both actions? David Farr : Well, you have \u2013 yes, you do it because some of these projects are getting much larger and then more complex and they are not \u2013 I mean obviously we have more than two customers in process. So from our perspective we are seeing customers around the world some will slow it down and try \u2013 spread their capital around a little longer to make sure that they don\u2019t get ahead of what they from a capacity standpoint. And secondly you will start seeing also from the standpoint of customers have long-term projects they want to get them going. They want to get the engineering work done and get in the queue. So you are seeing both. The activity level and the global process world by industry is sitting at record levels and we have not seen that curtail that much, it maybe a slower growth rate this year but it\u2019s still a pretty good, it\u2019s still running at pretty high levels. So there is \u2013 yes they got one foot on the gas pedal, one foot tapping the brake and they are doing both right now and which is un-incumbent for us. Deane Dray - Citi: Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. David Farr : You\u2019re welcome. Take care. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse : Hi, thanks David Farr : Hi, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse : I just wanted to follow up on the sort of 8% to 9% run rate you talked about on orders, I mean, I guess is that a run-rate that you expect to continue for some time or is that 8%, 9% really just reflecting the one-off big boost you had in the March sort of standalone month or do you think you can see 8% to 9% as a daily orders increase for some time? David Farr : I would \u2013 the word some time is a long time. I would say that Julian as I look to the last six weeks is growing this 8%, 9%, I think you could see a couple months of that at this point, my visibility from that standpoint. If you saw a solidification of the residential marketplace and start seeing that pick backup, which some people are saying it\u2019s going to improve as the year progresses on a calendar year basis and you continue to see the European recovery continuing not have a hit from what\u2019s going on in Russia or Eastern Europe. But I think you could see this go on for several more months after that. But right now, I think I am a little bit nervous in saying is that residential going to come back after how much of weekend and also what is the side effect of what\u2019s going on in Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe. So, I think that I am looking right now I see at least two months of pretty good underlying daily run rate of orders. And if I see things continuing to improve in residential and Europe, then that could go out for couple more months. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse : Got it, thanks. And then in the Network Power, the margin was about 8%. I think you are looking at over 10% for the year, so you got a decent jump up in the back half. Is there any \u2013 is that sort of just a leverage game of year-on-year growth or is it just a release of a lot of kind of cost savings coming through at the same time? David Farr : It\u2019s a function of our growth. We have \u2013 if you look at our Network Power business historically, we have a stronger second half and then also some of the cost savings are starting to come through, but we typically \u2013 we have built quite a good backlog the last couple of months here. And it\u2019s a matter of just executing the sales level there, that\u2019s our normal second half, Network Power is usually a better margin if you look back over time. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse : Thanks. And then lastly very quickly, Middle East, Africa had a very big swing from kind of December quarter organic growth to what happened in March. Just wondered what you are thinking for kind of June or the next six months in that region for organic sales? David Farr : I am more nervous about Middle East at this point in time given the turmoil going on the Middle East. We have a lot of projects underway in the Middle East. We have a lot of orders going on in the Middle East right now, but I am a little bit nervous as the general business environment. If you look what\u2019s going on in the Middle East, I am a little bit concerned about that both through Middle East and Africa. So, we have \u2013 we expect it to be positive second half of the year. I think when we get going, the other regions will be better and the Middle East will be not as good. That\u2019s my general feel right now. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse : Great, thanks. David Farr : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Thanks. Good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Dave, was just wondering with the pronounced orders surge of process if you had a sense, what sort of concentration of large projects drove that and what was \u2013 in what part maybe was it a general broad acceleration and pickup in activity? David Farr : We\u2019re seeing \u2013 we are seeing the pickup in orders coming out of our \u2013 what I call downstream business in our North America. We are seeing some of that. We are also seeing some very, very large projects happening around the world right now, that we have been working on for a while and we saw the last couple of months we have seen them book. But it\u2019s a very broad group of orders right now it\u2019s not focused one or two customer. It\u2019s a very broad based and a lot of large projects coming around Asia, coming out of the United States and some downstream. So, from my standpoint, I look at that, that\u2019s why I feel pretty good about the second half and going into 2015 in process, because they are building the backlog, they are building the order base to be able to deliver that. The question is will we see more confidence in what I\u2019d call the OEM or the MRO type of business early on here. So, I like the mix of the large projects, medium projects in process right now. It\u2019s a good mix. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay. And then just looking at the 2016 Network Power target of 12% to 14% margin, what would it take to enter the bottom of the range in fiscal \u201815 in terms of how much is volume dependent versus realizing some of your self help? David Farr : Right now, I would say most of the volume will be volume dependent, because we are investing right now in Network Power to get through some of the next generation technology, some innovation in the service area. So, if we could see continued good improvement in our orders in particular right now we are seeing a recovery in orders in Europe. We have seen recovery in Asia what we need to see is recovery in North America so we see very much stronger North America and you will see that profitability coming faster. North America is a key one to watch. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay and then just lastly on the cooling side, you have weathered a mix down in that space to what extent do you think that\u2019s run it\u2019s course or remains dynamic to contend with? David Farr : Our Network Power side or the Climate Technologies side? Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Network Power. David Farr : I think from the standpoint of what we are seeing right now the mix and our faith that we have the complete offering I think we have weathered that and we are starting to see that trend upwards. I feel good about where we are right there now. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Thank you. David Farr : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Yes, thanks. Good morning guys. Sorry good afternoon guys. David Farr : Good afternoon Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : I just want to pickup \u2013 I just want to pickup on the process orders and I think I know the answer, just want to clarify, so you are talking about are we \u2013 do you think that from here on we see larger orders hitting the backlog and sort of longer duration orders, so therefore we should expect to see a bit more volatility in the order pace going forward. And perhaps it\u2019s a correlation between order growth and revenue growth gets a bit more extended? David Farr : I think the answer to that is yes the projects are definitely as you know I have talked about are definitely much larger, they are more complex, we are booking them sooner and we are having to manage those over time. So I would say based on the type of the businesses and the type of projects we are doing they are much larger projects there will be a lot more volatility within that both from the sales standpoint and the profitability standpoint within a quarter of a year. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Great. And again you talked about the some of these projects getting pushed out a little bit and what\u2019s \u2013 is your sense that maybe there is some sensitivity on the macro volatility maybe Ukraine, etcetera, Middle East or do you think it\u2019s just a bit more of a push towards capital efficiency from the majors? David Farr : There is two things going on. One, my large customer base is being asked to slowdown some of their expenditures and redirect some of that money towards I would say shareholders both on a broad basis the big capital projects guys. They are not stopping the project they may just rather than a project taking 14 months it\u2019s going to take 16 months. And so there will be \u2013 they are having pressure on them to spread their cash and to allocate more cash back to the shareholders and put the projects still at very high paybacks they are going to do them. And then from a standpoint of just projects because of some of the large complexity projects it just takes \u2013 sometimes it takes longer than anticipated and with the uncertainty and certain things around the world both the Middle East turmoil, like you said Eastern Europe turmoil some of the questions coming in say Australia they have said okay let\u2019s slow this down a little bit and take a little longer. So you got two things going on right now working on our large customer base. The projects are going, they are just going to take their time and use that cash a little bit longer. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Okay, that\u2019s really helpful Dave. And then just one more on Artesyn we had $0.03 this quarter, I think a lot of that was restructuring, I think you have got about $70 million for the full year which would suggest another $35 million in the second half of the year, is that correct and is that more restructuring or was that more a run rate going forward? David Farr : I think for the whole year, aren\u2019t we doing \u2013 Frank we are doing $70 million - $80 million? Frank Dellaquila : No, no you are looking at \u2013 he is looking at our reconciliation probably. Where are you seeing? David Farr : From the restructuring. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : The 30 bps in the appendix, 30 bps margins? Frank Dellaquila : Okay. So that if you look at the reconciliation at the back of the slide, the 34, 35 that we took this quarter should be all there is. We are not expecting any more for the year. It\u2019s really 1.4 points and both the Artesyn and whatever rounding is in there is a result of us using ranges for those estimates all got jammed into that 30 bps. So the answer is, no there is no behind it. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : I see. Thank you very much. David Farr : So if you look at the answer \u2013 what I will answer the question is if you look at internal restructuring which we do on an ongoing basis yes, we are talking first of all on $30 million, $35 million for that. Frank Dellaquila : Absolutely I thought your question that was strictly on the Artesyn piece. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Thanks for the answer for that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O\u2019Callaghan with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura Securities : Good afternoon everyone. David Farr : Good afternoon Shannon. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura Securities : Hi, Dave. On the gross margins, up 140 basis points I mean you have the benefit there from the exit of embedded, but maybe break that out if you could and what other factors drove the gross margin improvement and then are there any headwinds coming in the second half to that? David Farr : From the standpoint of our GP margin we there is \u2013 obviously Artesyn did help us. And as you know, we talk about 50 basis points at the EBIT line is probably about 50, 70 points, 90 basis points at the GP line. So the rest is just operational improvement and mix going on. So I expect our GP margin to be pretty good for the year. We actually forecast a pretty good GP margin for the year and then we are looking for underlying operating performance, mild underlying operating performance with investing more into the company. So that\u2019s why you are seeing now as much spread improvement between GP and OP you normally would see, but we are investing internally right now. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura Securities : Okay. And then you have mentioned a couple of times about executing against elevated backlog, I mean, is that unusually backed up because of some of these project delays or what\u2019s sort of behind that comment, how soon do you think that will get released? David Farr : The comments, one, it\u2019s both for you guys, but also my own operating people are on the phone right now, they all listen to what I say. So, I mean, the key issue is our backlog is sitting at very high levels, with the orders the last say 45, 60 days we have been building backlog. So, the key issue for us is to execute as much as we can in that backlog. Clearly, some of this in the process world, the Network Power world and the industrial world is a little bit longer lead time, but anything that we can work on execution. Our operations are fine. It\u2019s just a matter of what can we execute with our customer base, if we got how to get done and work that backlog back down. I don\u2019t like carrying that much backlog. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura Securities : Okay, thanks. David Farr : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Thanks and good afternoon gents. David Farr : Good afternoon, Steve. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : On the gross margin point, just following that up and given what I think this is the highest gross margin ever for this quarter, right? David Farr : From my knowledge, yes. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : What\u2019s the price cost dynamic and can you give us a sense of the green versus red comfort level you have there as you are looking forward? David Farr : Yes, right now, Steve, let\u2019s go back, let\u2019s step at February. We thought from a price cost standpoint that we have been pretty much neutral this year, maybe slightly plus or minus 0.1, just very much neutral. Right now, we are doing pretty well. What\u2019s happened is our net material inflation as the economy has been weaker or actually our net material inflation has got more negative. And so right now, we are definitely green from a slightly positive green. So, we are probably going above the line. We expect that, that will hold for the rest of this year and then we will start going into it. If net material inflation continues to let\u2019s say become more negative because of the weakness around the world and the excess capacity, then you will see us have more pricing pressures next year. But right now, we are in pretty good shape from a price cost standpoint finished this year and going into 2015. So, I like where we are right now. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : It sounds like a sweet spot actually on that front? David Farr : It is a sweet spot right now, but you get sweet spot for about three months and then you get whacked. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. And on the acquisition point that you made, well actually acquisition and CapEx, on the acquisition point you made about your spending level, I mean, you are looking at an environment where it feels like some of the prices being paid are moving into frothy territory, particularly in some of your end markets. I mean, how are you \u2013 how is that impacting your placeholder for that? David Farr : For this year, we got pretty close. We may not quite get to 125, but we are going to be pretty close. From my perspective right now, we are actively working trying to figure out how to build our pipeline of acquisitions. I\u2019d like us to see us do more acquisitions given our strength of cash and our profitability state and our capabilities globally, but at the same time, we have to be very, very careful that we don\u2019t obviously get too aggressive on the pricing and pay too higher price, but right now, my operations from the standpoint of places we want to go, I like where we are and I think we are ready to handle some more, but nothing say imminent, but I really turning up the heat internally both of our operations and corporate people to safely identify more, but you are right, the pricing is a key issue, you can\u2019t get carried away. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : And just lastly on CapEx, that $800 million number, how much of that is sort of growth CapEx versus maintenance versus maybe you can even think about productivity, I am not sure where you put that one? David Farr : I would say the big increase this year for us is twofold, productivity. So if you look at the $100 million plus they were putting I would say a third of that is probably productivity increase as we are trying to drive our plans more efficiently and then the rest will be capacity. We are adding capacity around the world. And we have continued to expand. We did a lot of capacity offline in the last downturn and before the last downturn. And now, we are replacing that capacity in what I would call in more appropriate areas, in areas I want it. And it\u2019s going to be much more efficient capacity. So we are adding capacity and getting geared up for the continued growth of our customer base around the world. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : And is that in process this capacity or multiple places? David Farr : It\u2019s across the board, it\u2019s both in process, it\u2019s industrial, it\u2019s also in sort of a residential solutions area, so it\u2019s around the world. We are seeing this around our basis, all the companies. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Thanks. David Farr : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo : Hey, good afternoon everyone. David Farr : Good afternoon, Rich. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo : Just, Dave, your comments on residential, what are you seeing \u2013 new construction was weak in the first quarter and most people expect that to come back, what are you seeing on the replacement side that would give you more cause for concern, because it seems like you are a little more cautious that some of this should come back due to its weather related, but just a little more color on there? David Farr : I would say the underlying just the demand, the numbers coming out are very concern to me and the fact if you look at the \u2013 if you really start cutting down the employment numbers and looking where the jobs are being created and lack of employment and lack of hours, I am very, very nervous about what people spend. I mean, the residential recovery has been very, very short-lived, bam, like what, five quarters. And so I am a little bit nervous about the fact will people get concerned about their incomes, spending, their cost of living has gone up and so how much more money are they going to reallocate towards the houses. Will they move and then refurbish? That\u2019s a key issue for us. Will they refurbish? Will they upgrade? And right now, I think people being very cautious relative to that. And my concern is we see it should be a little bit better in the second half, but it doesn\u2019t, that will be a problem. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo : Okay. David Farr : It\u2019s not a good sign out there right now. Those job numbers last week were not good. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo : Okay. And then on Network Power, just with chloride in Europe, the orders are picking up here, how much of this is improvement in underlying demand versus just the comparables are favorable and they continue to be favorable? How confident are you in the European piece? David Farr : We are seeing, we have got our act together from through the integration. So we have made a lot of changes both from an operational standpoint and a leadership standpoint. And so I am seeing better execution within the leadership and within the space that we had actually lost. And secondly, I am seeing some of our core markets actually do a little bit better where they have underinvested for quite some time, particularly UK, which we are very strong in the UK and they are starting to see some good improvement in the UK. So, from my perspective, I think we are seeing the momentum and the question is now can we keep that going as the European economy continues to progress. Our programs are continuing to kick in. I feel better about Europe as we go forward here. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo : Okay. And then just the last one for me on process, with the project activity picking up how should we think about incrementals, because that would seem to have a dampening impact on incrementals beyond this year? David Farr : It will hold them down. It will hold it down. Our process is going to run high levels of profitability in any quarter. As I talked about earlier, you can get some good MRO type of business or small what I call brown type, brown expansions versus a greenfield. So right now, we are running at this on an average about 20% operating margins or EBIT margins within process. And I think we are going to stay around that level, but because the big projects will hold us back leveraging that a whole lot. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo : Okay. Right, thank you. David Farr : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremie Capron with CLSA. Please go ahead. Jeremie Capron - CLSA: Thank you. Good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon, Jeremie. Jeremie Capron - CLSA: China, clearly 9% growth, third consecutive quarter of pretty good growth there and this despite weaker macro indicators, could you give us some color on what you are seeing in that country? David Farr : In the market space we are serving right now, we are seeing pretty good continued investment. The process world, the industrial productivity world, some of the refrigeration stuff we are working on, some of the core spaces, a lot of investment going on again in their telecommunication infrastructure in China, right now. These are the markets we play in. We are not into the big infrastructure type of projects, which has slowed down. So we continue to see pretty good opportunity here. I would expect for us to see pretty good high single-digit growth this year throughout this year. I am actually watching it very, very closely relative to the business pace and both Ed and I are spending time there, because it\u2019s an important marketplace for us, but we have now seen several good quarters and I expect to go forward. I do not expect to see an acceleration, and I do not see a deceleration at this point in time. I see pretty good high single-digit growth for us and all coming off a pretty good base. Jeremie Capron - CLSA: Okay. So, when you look at your order intake in March and so far in April, are you seeing the same trend unfolding? David Farr : Yes, in China, yes. Jeremie Capron - CLSA: Great, thanks very much. David Farr : You\u2019re welcome. You take care. Operator : Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to management for any closing remarks. David Farr - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Good. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I appreciate your support and look forward to seeing many of you in the coming weeks and hopefully things will continue to prove around the world. And we want to have any more shocks to the world be it from Eastern Europe or be it from Middle East or wherever it\u2019s going to come from. So, I wish you all well. Thank you very much. Bye. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Emerson\u2019s Investor Conference Call. During today's presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. (Operator Instructions). This conference is being recorded today, August 5, 2014. Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Patrick Fitzgerald, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead. Patrick Fitzgerald : Thank you, Vickie. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will summarize Emerson's third quarter 2014 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany [Technical Difficulty] that is available on Emerson's website at emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next three months. I will start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on page two of the conference call slide presentation. Net sales decreased 1% to $6.3 billion, with underlying sales up 3%. Global economic conditions were mix as areas of softness continued, matured markets improved up 3% led by the U.S. and Europe, and contract and emerging markets slowed 2% growth reflecting political instability and economic uncertainty in certain regions. Backlog is at a record level up more than 20% year-to-date driven by underlying orders growth of 5%. Margin expansion was strong as portfolio changes and operational efficiencies more than offset growth investment. Earnings per share of $1.03 increased 6%, cash generations remained strong exceeding our expectation. Moving to the next slide P&L summary. As I mentioned underlying sales grew 3% with orders and divestitures deducting 5% and acquisitions adding 1% or net sales down 1%. Gross profit increased 3% with a 130 basis points of margin improvement EBIT excluding charges in the prior year grew 5% up by lower restructuring with margin expansion of 90 basis points. Operationally the tax rate was higher compared to the year impacting earnings per share by $0.03. repurchase of 2.8 million shares in the quarter contributed the EPS of $1.03 up 6% excluding charges in the prior year. Next slide sales by geography. Underlying sales grew in the U.S. by 5%, Europe by 4%, Asia by 3% including China up 8% and Latin America by 1%, Canada and Middle East and Africa declined by 3% and 9% respectively, such that total underlying sales were up 3%. Strength continued in China and mature markets improved, while emerging markets were softer, especially in Brazil and the Middle East. Next slide, segment earnings and cash flow. Segment margin expanded 50 basis points with improvement in Industrial Automation, Network Power, and Commercial and Residential Solutions. Pretax earnings were substantially higher due to lower corporate expense and charges in the Artesyn business last year. Cash generation remained solid up 4% year-to-date, overcoming the Artesyn divestiture impact. Trade working capital performance remained steady for the most part at about 10 basis points. Moving to slide six, Process Management. Process Management underlying sales increased 2% with North America up 7%, Asia down 2% including China up 7%, Europe increased 5%, Latin America was up 5%, and Middle East and Africa down 11%. Acquisitions added 4% for net sales growth of 6%. Global energy and chemical industries continued to drive growth, but project execution remains slow, as customers continue to proceed cautiously. North America was strong, as U.S. unconventional oil and gas offset softness in Canada related to project timing. Asia decreased reflecting market softness and difficult comparisons in Australia that offset continued strength in China. Europe growth was led by emerging markets and Mexico drove Latin American growth. Political instability remained disrupted in the Middle East. Margins remain solid about 20%. Continued momentum in North America, anticipated recovery in Asia and record backlogs put outlook for solid near-term growth. Next slide, Industrial Automation. Industrial Automation underlying sales were flat with North America unchanged, Asia up 3%, Europe down 5%, Latin America up 6%, and Middle East and Africa up 4%. Demand for industrial goods continued to recover slowly with mixed trends across markets and geographies. North America was stable in total and varied by business with growth in the U.S. offsetting weakness in Canada. Europe slowed as economic momentum stalled while strength continued in China. Fluid automation, electrical distribution and materials joining led the growth offset by declines in power generating alternators and motors and drives. Auto recovery is expected to continue but improvement will be slow due uneven economic trends and demand, especially in Europe and the Middle East. Next slide, Network Power. Network Power underlying sales increased 2%, with North America up 2%, Asia up 6%, Europe up 10%, Latin America down 22%, and Middle East and Africa down 16%. Artesyn divestiture deducted 20% for a net sales decrease of 18%. Growth was strong in the telecommunications infrastructure business, led by double-digit gains in Asia and North America. Data center markets were stable globally but mixed across geographies. The robust growth in Europe benefited from a large project in Sweden and modest market improvement. Strength in Asia was led by China and India. North America remained slow and Latin America was weak impacted by the exit of non-strategic businesses in that region. The margin from the reflected portfolio changes and continued strategic investments in Network Power. Backlog strength and improving market conditions support the outlook for modest growth and improving profitability into next year. Moving to slide, Climate Technologies. Climate Technologies net and underlying sales grew 6% with North America up 4%, Asia and Europe both up 9%, Latin America up 16% and Middle East and Africa up 2%. Growth is led by double-digit increase in the global refrigeration business with China and Europe particularly robust. The U.S. air conditioning business grew moderately, with double-digit growth in service, mid-single-digit growth in residential and single-digit growth in commercial. International air condition demand was mixed with stronger growth in Europe and flat market conditions in Asia. Favorable market conditions are expected to continue globally led by improvements in the U.S. air conditioning business. Next slide Commercial & Residential Solutions. Commercial & Residential Solutions net and underlying sales increased 4% with North America and international sales both increasing 4%. Market conditions improved sequentially benefiting from recovery from harsh winter weather North America the previous quarter. With the strong growth and the professional tools in residential storage businesses with modest growth and wet/dry vacuums and food waste disposers, segment margin was strong expanding 170 basis points. Recovery momentum is expected to continue in the near-term benefiting from improvement in U.S. residential and commercial construction markets. Moving to slide 11, 2014 outlook. Despite areas of ongoing uncertainty global economic momentum continues to improve gradually in overall mixed environment. Mature market momentum is encouraging and should continue to improve. Geopolitical tension and economic challenges in some markets continue to work against [Technical Difficulty] and is not expected to improve in the near-term. Orders growth is expected to accelerate increasing to between 5% and 7% in the fourth quarter. On a preliminarily basis July trailing three month orders are approaching 7% growth with the standalone month of double digit. With the slower than expected growth year-to-date, financial performance is trending to the low end of the previously communicated guidance ranges of underlying sales growth 3% to 5%, reported sales change minus 1% to 1% reflecting divestitures completed acquisitions and currency translation. Reported earnings per share of $3.68 to $3.80 and operating cash flow 3.5 billion due to an increase from prior expectations. With that overview of results I will turn it over to David Farr. David Farr :  Thank you very much, Pat. I also want to welcome Frank Dellaquila who is joining us in the conference room. First I would like to thank all the investors for joining us today on this call, we appreciate it. And next I would like to also thank the global operating leaders for delivering a very strong profitable and cash flow quarter, despite an actual weaker sales with the underlying sales of only around 3%, even with a very unstable global geopolitical environment. Operations along the corporate organization continue to execute in a challenging environment to deliver top-line growth, good earnings, margins, very strong cash flow and very good return. As Pat mentioned, we had our first cut at July and good orders for the month of July, now three months average looks like around 7%. As we said in the press release we think coming in the 5% to 7% the key for us now is to execute and increase our sales momentum, reduce our record levels of backlog, continue and convert sales orders or the orders to come in relative to sales in the fourth quarter, key focus backlog conversion of current orders. As we look at the world today, lot of uncertainty, U.S. economy continues to improve slightly for us, Mexico continues to good for us, Western Europe, Southeast Asia, China running at very strong levels for us, hopefully that will continue the next couple of year. India, Japan all trending very nicely and with good solid orders and good solid sales growth at the same time. Clearly the other markets around the world with the geopolitical environment are very stressed and also are very concerning to me, given what we're seeing today and have been for the last several months and then certainly that would create in any business environments for our customer base including myself. Profitability remains at record levels for the company. Our cash flow was very strong. We are very much focused as we view the report today on investing in innovation, investing in the programs, the solutions organization, the service organization that will drive longer term premium growth and premium valuations and cash flow for this company. Clearly, the underlying growth rate is not what we expected in the first nine months of this year. Orders remained at very good levels, but somewhat choppy relative to our customer base, but still at good level. The pace of growth is not above what I would call the acceleration rate around 4%, but we are slightly better this quarter versus last quarter, but not as strong as we thought when we entered the quarter. Growth is the challenge, quality growth is very important. The pace is improving and we're clearly looking to try and accelerate this in the fourth quarter. But from standpoint of true operations and when I look at from the conversion of our cash flow again looking at conversion of our cash flow at over a 100% again this year. A 20% plus return on total capital after-tax based on what we see right now. Our cash flow giving back to our shareholders at over 60% plus again this year between share repurchase and dividend. And a deep level of orders but the key issue for us is converting, getting orders out and to bring all the sales and profit and cash. So as I look at the quarter from my perspective the quarter clearly did not meet our expectation to sales growth, profitability and cash flow are actually better, on a margin return and cash conversion standpoint, growth is the key issue. However, there is slight improvement momentum and the key issue for us as we go into the fourth quarter and this year is to make that happen and convert. So where we sit today, we\u2019ve got to convert, we\u2019ve got to get the orders, we\u2019ve got to reduce the backlog and then deliver profitability which I believe we\u2019re set up to do for the remainder part of this year. But again I remind everybody around the world right now the geopolitical situations are probably some of the worst I\u2019ve ever seen and relative to what we pay to the global company for every good market out there having the market that concerns me and that\u2019s something we have to deal with as a company and something I could be able to see as a CEO and we will see how to deal and we\u2019re dealing with that. But it is a concern. So, I\u2019ll do that open the floor for the people ask questions, but again I want to thank the corporate executive that did a great job this quarter as we brought the quarter end and also thanks all the operating executives out there delivering a very strong profit and return quarter for our shareholders. So with that, I'll turn it up. Frank, let\u2019s will take some questions Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question today will come from (inaudible) with Cowen & Company. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, thank you. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what you're doing at network power to kind of improve the margins now with the new portfolio. And is it realistic to assume kind of double-digit margins in Q4 and throughout fiscal '15 based on what you're doing? And I have a follow-up? David Farr : Yes. I think the keys or us is the order paid continues to be good for, the key issue for us at this point in time is a new products coming out, is this function of converting that and getting across the line. I still believe that we'll see double-digit margins in the fourth quarter. And from my perspective, we're seeing the growth pickup, we're starting to see a better mix of the business, we're starting to see what I call the more transaction business start to improve and we've had some very good large projects around the world which are obviously little bit lower margin for us, but the growth rate starting to build. So I feel from a standpoint of the product, our solutions organization and the management focus on this the underlying value of the business is continuing to improve and we'll continue move towards to learn higher margins and reaching our double-digit margin as we go into 2015. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Just a quick follow-up, you up the share buyback a bit. If you could jus talk generally about your cash deployment kind of priority as we look for the next fiscal, you are a little higher on share buyback than you were (inaudible) is that sort of what we should expect going forward? Thanks. David Farr :  First of all, I don\u2019t think there is going to be much change relative to the mix relative to the ratios I\u2019ve given back to you. Our actual acquisitions were actually higher than our share repurchase. We did about $1.4 billion acquisitions and we are going to be doing about $1 billion of share repurchase. We paid back $1.2 billion to our shareholders in dividends; we just announced our 48th year of increased dividend to our shareholders, 58 I am sorry, didn\u2019t count anymore. And then I think internally we have raised our capital. Our capital spending will be over $800 million this year, up strongly from last year\u2019s around $700 million as we continue invest in innovation and new products and our global footprint. As I look at next year assuming the same type of improvement in cash flow generation, you are going to see us buying back stock level around the same, maybe little bit higher if we complete the divestiture of PTS, as we committed, if we do sell PTS, we will take that cash flow season and return that to shareholder and share repurchase which would cause us to actually deal a lot more in share repurchase. So right now, I would say the acquisitions as we are planning, it\u2019s going to be somewhere between $1 billion to $1.5 billion. The dividend, as I anticipate, I see no reason given our earnings and cash flow capabilities will increase our dividend next year, we will make that decision in November and our capital investment internally is going to be somewhere in the $800 million to $850 million range. So that\u2019s where we look out right now, not much a big change from this year. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks a lot. David Farr :  You\u2019re welcome. Operator :  Our next question will come from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein :  Hey, good morning. David Farr :  Hey, Steve. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein :  Or good afternoon I should say, good morning in some place right, a couple of things. Can you maybe talk a little bit about that backlog conversion that you referenced so many times? What are the hurdles to actually getting that done; is it operational or is it customer released some orders? How much of this is dependent on Emerson and how much is dependent upon your customers at this point? David Farr : From our perspective right now, we have the capacity and ability to produce, that's not an issue. There is no bottleneck, we have made the investments on a global basis to produce, it's very much industrial, process and Network Power focus. It's a function of to clear the customer, continue on spend the money and complete the projects or investments we're making. So right now, we are not the gating item relative to this, it's a function of our global customer base and it's very broad, it's not one or two customers. Our backlog, typically we would not have as big of a difference between our order pace, which is running over 5% year-to-date and our sales which is running less than 3% year-to-date. So, this is little bit unusual from my perspective, the order pace again this month was very strong and it's a function of okay, now let's get the orders converted and shipped to our customer base. And we're not a gating out of that area Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : But Dave, can you dive into that even a little bit, is it the customer, what's the general sentiment, is that just they are moving slowly with projects and then putting the brakes on or because of the global macro situation? What's your sense for why that conversion is slower than historically? David Farr : The conversion is the uncertainty around the world, via from a geopolitical situation and the fact that the underlying growth of the world are substantially below what people thought they were going to be just six months ago, Steve. I mean just look on what they watch 9on CBNC right now; we have a map of Africa with people sick. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Right. David Farr : Okay. So the world is talking about negative things. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. And that I guess as a follow up, you are spending past, not so much on the CapEx side, but on the expense side, you've been investing for growth pretty aggressively and have been very vocal about it coming into this year. Any early read on how that pace progresses as you transition to 2015? David Farr : I think it\u2019s going to be a function of what we see happening over the next two to three months on the order pattern. Do we see the underlying economic trends continue to improve which they are improving but very gradually. And we\u2019ll look and see where we stand relative to where we\u2019ve got down this year and we\u2019ll go through that internally. But a lot of these investment programs are not one year type of programs, these are investments we\u2019re making for the longer-term. So we\u2019re going to continue to raise our profitability next year and we\u2019ll continue to invest and continue to figure to out how to position the company for faster growth in a more challenging environment around the world for the next couple of years. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Okay, great. Thanks Dave. I appreciate, I\u2019ll pass it on. David Farr : Take care, Steve. Thanks. Operator : Next we\u2019ll hear from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse : Hi, thanks. Just on the margins, even with the sales falling short, it looks like the gross margin you\u2019re kind of on track to hit that 100 bps improvement this year, so the culprit seems to be more around SG&A. Is there anything unusual that in that number this year that should reverse? David Farr : What we -- as you well know, we\u2019ve raised the levels, we\u2019ve talked about in February for our internal investments relative to certain programs from the new products, the innovation and our investment in the solutions and service organizations. We\u2019ve maintained that even though underlying sales are slightly below what we thought they would be year-to-date that is fundamental we believe in what we\u2019re doing for the long-term. Therefore we\u2019re obviously converting GP and we\u2019re putting money back in the company and not quite giving as much back to shareholders at this point, even though the GP is going up and an EBIT margins are going up, they\u2019re not going up as much as you\u2019d expect that we had higher sales growth. So, the key issue for me is as we get into the next year planning cycle. What we modulate continue investment and then we see continue GP and expansion which I do believe we'll see and the question is do we see continued improvement in the underlying business spending environment which we've been seeing for the last three or four months and now we've just can make sure it is converted as we go into 2015. That's what I look at right now Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse : Thanks. And then I guess if we look at process management. The last few years margins are pretty stable going back to 2011, do you think when you get the mix of backlog and the sort of investment requirements from here the margins are probably like to be flattish sort of to medium them as well? David Farr : I would expect as to build into a very flattish margin for 2015 for process management. I would expect even all the growth rate will be little bit better next year given the backlog in the pace of business we see out there. I do expect this continue to make some significant investment and some of the capacity that we're putting in place right now for our international business relative to process and also even in the U.S. will be coming online which we'll create obviously somewhat negative margin pressure but I think the growth will offset. So at this point in time, we continue to invest, we're trying to invest the technology and capacity that\u2019s necessary to grow the business nicely and also make sure we invest in the future and not just melt the profitably others business, which is you all know very strong. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse : Great. Thank you. David Farr : Take care. Thank you. Operator : Next we'll here from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Thanks. Good afternoon, Dave. David Farr : Good afternoon, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Just wanted to turn your attention back to network power. And I'm just wondering that if you know the pressure you seen on margins. Is price a factor or is the sharp decline you\u2019ve seen in Lat-Am and Middle East is that the bigger factor for those margins? David Farr :  The lack of more margin improvement in the third quarter would be two reasons, one the direct drop off in Middle East and secondly would be the fact that there was more larger projects big project wins in there with the new business versus what I would call the day to day transactional the core business which had slowed down in parts of North America those were the two things that cause that margin pressure in that third quarter not see as much expansion I don\u2019t see the Middle East turning around and the key thing right now will be as we go forward here is the continued mix we have seen in some of the core business you are seeing a little bit of that already improvement in North America but that\u2019s clearly what has been the key to us relative making improved margins as we go in the fourth quarter and we go into 2015. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Okay. No that\u2019s great and appreciate the color on July orders Dave, the acceleration to I think you said double digits within the month of the July how broad base is that acceleration was it primarily within purchase management or was it a bit broader than that? David Farr :  Well it\u2019s pretty across the board everyone has at least a five in front of their name. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Okay, great. And then on the backlog finally obviously a lot of it depends on when customers actually wanted to have their orders shipped but any visibility when you expect to see purchase management to accelerate in terms of sales? David Farr :  I would expect the process to have a little bit better quarter this quarter in sales we there is couple of things go on in our business we are fiscal year ending September, there is obviously a lot of things happen relative people driving to make targets and bonuses and they actually have the orders so I would expect to see a little bit improvement this year the fourth quarter and process I expect the first half to be better growth rate than we saw last year. So, I think that's what we see at this point of time, it's really a function of what happened in the North American and European business pace as we go forward in the next couple of months in orders right. I think the next three quarters should be better growth for the process business. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Thanks a lot Dave. David Farr : You welcome. Take care. Operator : Next we'll hear from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : Thank you, good afternoon everyone. David Farr : Good afternoon Jeff. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : Hello. Could we come back to the investor [Technical Difficulty] No, I'm in the office. Can you hear me okay? David Farr : Yes, we can hear you. Yes, it\u2019s a fair line. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : I just wanted to come back to the investment spending date on are you guys tracking to that 110 incremental you talked about the February Analyst Day. And when you say we will look at modulating as we kind of plan in the year ahead. Does that mean you are planning a lower rate of growth or an actual decline in that number. How do we think about that going forward? David Farr : I think, we are tracking towards the 110. We've held very, very tightly. We might move pieces around, but we've held very tightly to the incremental programs. What I'm looking at right now, what I try to express that as I look at the underlying global industrial environment, it continues to improve and we continue to see the underlying growth rate slowly continue to move backed up, which is then we've been convert into sale. And I see a momentum that figure, they get this, try to get this above that 4% underlying growth rate. And we may actually increase this slightly, but I'm trying to keep it in line to where we can grow the business and have some margin from the next year and 2015. So, if I'm going to look at, what's working, what's not working. The other key issue for me right now is Jeff, in certain markets, the emerging markets around the world as I discussed in my board today. The markets we've made some investments for last several years, even going way back 10 years ago we\u2019ve made even more in the last couple of years. If I think those markets are going to really struggle for the next 12 to 18 months I will pull back the range. And that would obviously that\u2019s the function of my concerns or as concerns about certain emerging markets, let\u2019s put that way, not the total emerging market, pieces of certain emerging markets. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : And conversely then Dave what you just described maybe you could you say is a potential shift from offense to defense where we\u2019re going to expect the structure to go up but came in a little later than I thought here in Q3. What do you think about the structure going forward? David Farr : I don\u2019t think I am moving to go to defense quite yet. I am still offense Jeff. I think that from my perspective I am just talking about I may go back and not we\u2019ve already made a lot of investments for instance India the class example. We\u2019ve made significant investments in India last four years. India had a very difficult 18 months as, order patterns up nicely just starting to turn around and therefore do I need to really put to a lot more into India, we\u2019ll put some but it\u2019s not going to be as aggressive as we have been doing. I am not definitely not (inaudible) defensive mode right now and I do not anticipate restructuring to be higher next year than this year. I just don\u2019t feel we\u2019ve gone through massive restructuring, where we\u2019ve been investing and I think the world from a stability standpoint from what we need to get done what we\u2019ve got done at a couple of places but I would guess right now my restructuring will be less in 2015 than it is in 2014. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : And maybe just finally Dave I don\u2019t know if you want to address or maybe Frank would have a quick comment, but any early read on how to think about pension into next year for Emerson on the P&L? David Farr : Pension. Pension. Frank Dellaquila : Pension, well when we look at it right now the discount rate is down about 50 basis points from where we ended last year so if that holds we\u2019re going to see pension is a little bit of a headwind next year. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : Okay. Thank you. David Farr : You're welcome. Operator : Moving on we'll here from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Thank you, good afternoon. Dave on the backlog, excuse me up 20% year-to-date, I think you typically have some pretty good build to this point in the year. What sort of the normal range of builds from the beginning of the year into entering the fourth quarter? David Farr : I would say the 20% is abnormal. I would say typically and we had discussion with the board today, the directors are asking a very same question. I mean you all know I am guiding this thing and what's going on the world right now is not that easy. But typically if we're growing our orders 5%, 5.5%, 6%, we typically would see only 1.5 of that basically going into backlog. We would see backlog building and we give a very little bit more. So that's the order of magnitude normal, right now it's a little bit higher than that. We've had some bigger larger projects which are, we have the only multiple years, which are build in the process area and we also have customers who have higher growth expectations, we're still down those fact. So there is a little bit of difference going on here, I don't have any sense. The cancellations are not an issue for us this point in time and we've got see indication of that. It is just I think people are being stretching, their investment dollars right now on us and therefore that's what costs in this delta. So delta is, I would say about a point, the point 150 basis points higher than normal. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay. And do you have a year-over-year growth number for backlog? David Farr : I do not on top of my head what we were in end of July last year. You are talking about I mean June-to-June, correct? Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Yes. David Farr : I don't know, I don't know that top of my head. I mean frankly look into book right now. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay. That's good to hear. David Farr : And I am passing Frank, he is calculating right now. And Frank's going to oh my god pass can give a number out visited by the CFO. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Well we got to keep you busy while they are busy. David Farr :  Here we go we got right here. Frank Dellaquila :  It\u2019s just about 11% year-on-year. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay and then Dave\u2026 David Farr :  That\u2019s how we historically reduced it in the fourth quarter. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Right. And then if you could even just big sort of handicap the segment versus the multi-year CAGRs you laid out earlier in the year for \u201815? David Farr :  Okay. Want me to say versus our long-term growth rate for the segment. I would say right now the old February he is talking about the February number I gave you for process is what do you remember? Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: 5 to 7. David Farr :  I would say the process is going to be in that -- I would the process will be in the next -- probably the next three year I think I had there three years is that what that was what I got there. Right here. We said 5 to 7, I would say the next -- I would say they are going to be in that range right now, they are still in that range. I think climate is going to be in that range, right now commercial residential will be in that range. Now where power I think will the potential being slightly above the range I gave you 3 to 5 and industrial, I mentioned I think will probably in that range at this point in time. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Great thanks for that. David Farr :  I think the progress we are going to make at network power on the global reach and the technology of the product is really starting to playout. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Thank you. David Farr :  You are welcome, take care. Operator :  (Operator Instructions). Next we will hear from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : Hi, good afternoon. David Farr :  Good afternoon Rich how you are doing. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : Alright industrial automation here in the next couple of quarters with caps numbers down on a powergen side over the last few months. How do we think about that playing out near term for the business, assume there is some deceleration here expected, but if you could provide some color that would be great? David Farr : Yes. Caterpillar is not only a customer in the space and our non-Cat business has still been doing pretty good. We've gained some other market space around the world. So that we've seen a better non-Cat environment, Cat is still working through its inventory issues. But the key thing for me right now is continued improvement in our European business space for Industrial Automation. But right now, the Cat is always a concern, but right now I'm more interested in other non-Cat and the alternate space than anything else, which is okay. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : Alright. So the momentum in the non-cat stuff is there to at least be a decent offset to what you are seeing on the cat side. The way we should think about it. David Farr : Correct. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. David Farr : And also the Cat stuff, Cat typically, what they are doing right now may impact us further maybe in three months or four months versus today. Typically they don't react us like, okay they have a bad month this month adjust that quick though, they may make take a couple of months. Because they\u2019re volatile, so they have to be very careful, they don't turn things up or down that rapidly. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : Alright. Okay. And then just on staying on IA, just what do you see in terms of assets for that business? I know that's a focal point for M&A dollars. And what are you seeing in terms of attractiveness of assets and trying to bolster the portfolio there? David Farr : We continue to look for assets. We honestly have not made or found anything of substance this year in the asset. It's been mostly a process and a little bit Network Power, nothing in the Industrial Automation. And I would say right now we have nothing going on in Industrial Automation, even though that asset space is very interesting to us, in fact it\u2019s a pretty high at this point time. So, we're still looking, we're not in a big hurry here. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay, alright. Thanks. David Farr : You take care. Have a good one. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : Thanks. Operator : Next we\u2019ll hear from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Hey, good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon, Mr. Tusa. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: So just on Network Power, can you give any [of these] numbers, previously the margin in the third quarter of \u201813 ex embedded was what? And it\u2019s a lumpy business in the second half, so I just want to make sure that I was looking at that the right way. David Farr : About the same, about the same. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: So 8.1? David Farr : Yes, about the same, around 8%. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay. So, for the year in Network Power where do you now think that that margin is going to come in? I think the prior guide was 9.7 to 10. David Farr : I would say it\u2019s going to low of that, it\u2019s not going to be 10 for the year. And so it\u2019s going to be, the low end around 9, little between 9.2 somewhere around there. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay. And so I guess in the context of is something going to a little bit here, again you\u2019re kind of down year-over-year in the margin even though kind of I think the core revenues are flat to up. So, is this -- these big projects, are these kind of like the mix impact from the big projects, is that something that will you going forward or how does that dynamic change to improve profitability there over the next year? David Farr : I think the key issue for us as we had a slowed down in the core what I call the traditional space in the last three or four months and that business has started to pick back up. The project business, there was a bigger mix this quarter and that happens from time-to-time as this marketplace has changed. We see that happening and as we continue to work on the cost and new product. So, I see this business getting in a solid 9% EBIT margin for the year as we finish this year and then move on up from there as we get 10 plus percent as we go into 2015. It\u2019s that how I see at this point in time. And you're always going to have a big project mix coming out but the key to me is getting that installed base and then getting our service organization and to create value for us the long-term. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay. And then just one last question more detailed. You mentioned pension in the last couple of years, there has been ERP investment, incentive comp, there has been a lot of kind of non-fundamental stuff moving around. Anything else now for [Technical Difficulty] do you want to highlight with regards to the non-fundamental type of stuff? David Farr : No we\u2019ll continue the investments in the ERP as we go in the soft network power and climate. The pension interest rates continue to drop and will have that issue there, but I don't think it\u2019s new big headwind for us next year. And there is not -- I don\u2019t see us having a comp going to drop a little bit next year. So it's nothing big at this point in time, restructuring probably -- the adds are pretty, slightly less than this year. So no, I don't anything big moving next year Steve, plus or minus. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay. Thanks a lot. David Farr : All the best to you, Steve. Thanks. Operator : Next we'll here from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. John Inch - Deutsche Bank : Hello everyone. David Farr : Hi John. John Inch - Deutsche Bank : Hi, Dave. So, I'm just thinking about next year. So it sounds sort of like we\u2019re building some momentum in some of these businesses, we're going to do maybe 3% organic this year, hopefully a little bit better than that next year. If you put it all together, how are you thinking about the prospects perhaps doing double-digit earnings per share growth in 2015 fiscal? David Farr : I\u2019d like to really talk about that John. I think that it's a function of -- we've got, I guess it's definitely to really talk about that. Because I got to see how the underlying business spending environment continues improve as we finish this calendar year. I would say that we've been a little bit unusual. We increased our spending this year because we are making some strategic investments. And the collection -- some of our other customers have not so the question is will they start turning it on. I think they are going to have to turn it on because they have been under investment in certain areas. So really a function can we get above. For me I need to get this above 4% underlying sales growth you all know to really start seeing acceleration. And I am not ready to make that call yet. So I mean it\u2019s too early to call John. John Inch - Deutsche Bank : Yes that\u2019s fair. It sounds like if it\u2019s going to happen though it\u2019s probably will be fair to say it\u2019s more likely to be a backend loaded year, is that the way you are thinking about it or is that also turning itself? David Farr :  Sure. I am hoping that there is good momentum going out of this fiscal year going into the calendar year but it\u2019s too early to tell. It\u2019s really a function, okay as we -- they just put a GDP number out there it\u2019s pretty decent number, now how real is that number and is there a momentum coming around that and can Europe sustain this improvement and does the whole thing in the eastern Europe, Russia situation does that get worse and then also can China -- continues to improve for us, can that maintain. So there is a lot of things going our way but there is also some concerns I have as I said, in other parts of the world. So I think it\u2019s a little bit early to see; there is too many what I would call question marks out there. John Inch - Deutsche Bank : Yes. No, that\u2019s fair. The down Middle East numbers were processed; is that being driven by presumably to a degree some of the political strive you are seeing in the region but is it also a function of I think if some of the energy companies redirecting perhaps some of their own CapEx dollars back to North America or is there -- is it more of an Emerson specific timing issue or what\u2019s really going on there? David Farr :  Not really a redirection of capital spend from U.S. companies back to this country. the countries are investing and really typically are going to experience that. It\u2019s just a function, our customer in the Middle East basically are redirecting where they are spending their money, how they are spending their money and have really slowed down their spending on oil and gas and chemical and gas for Middle East. And I think as long as the turmoil continues in the Middle East, I think that will be continue to be a concern for our customer base and obviously for me. John Inch - Deutsche Bank : Okay. So it's not a question of redirection. You are saying your customers you think are slowing in the Middle East simply because of the political turmoil that's kind of happening. It's like an uncertainty climate or whatever, is that what you think? David Farr : That's what we're seeing, that\u2019s exactly we\u2019re seeing. They are spending money not with us, but with other people. John Inch - Deutsche Bank : Understood. Okay and then let me just\u2026 David Farr : Other industries. John Inch - Deutsche Bank : Other industries. And then just lastly right, so we've had pretty soft industrial markets, a little while, the pull back in industrial company share pricing. I mean are you considering possibly some larger portfolio actions on the acquisition divestiture side or possibly even raising more debt perhaps, you seem to have a lot of debt capacity to repurchase your shares? David Farr : Not at this very point of time. No, let's see other things unfold. John Inch - Deutsche Bank : That's fair. Thank you. David Farr : Okay. Thank you John. All the best to you. John Inch - Deutsche Bank : You're welcome. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Jeremie Capron with CLSA. Grace Lee - CLSA: High, thanks for taking our questions. This is Grace Lee sitting in for Jeremie Capron. We have a question on China. Hello can you hear me fine? David Farr : I can hear you fine. Grace Lee - CLSA:  Okay, so, our question is on China. Just wondering the prospect of growth in China noted that Emerson has an good growth from China for the past couple of quarters. Do you expect this growth could continue toward the fourth quarter and fiscal 15? A need of weakening of construction market as well as tight credit environment in China? David Farr : What we've seen so far Grace is as follows. We've had four very strong quarters and back, if you take the last four, we have the average over 8% over the last 12 months on underlying sales growth in China. Our orders have been in that range too. We had a very strong fourth quarter. So, I\u2019ll expect our fourth fiscal -- we have strong fourth for last year I\u2019d expect our fourth fiscal quarter this quarter to be positive but not as good as we\u2019ve seen in the last two or three quarters. It\u2019s just a comparison to next year and so I just think we\u2019re going to have a good number for us China for the fourth quarter. As I look at 2015, our investment profile right now is still decent. I expect it to see between 5% and 8% growth coming out of China next year based on what I am seeing from our new products, based on our customer base and based on the industries we serve. So as of right now as I look at the current expectation from my (inaudible) and where we are right now China looks like it\u2019s going to be growing forward and it might be growing slightly less or above in line what we saw this year. Grace Lee - CLSA: Great. Thank you. David Farr : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Moving on we\u2019ll hear from Mark Douglas with Longbow Research. Mark Douglas - Longbow Research : Good afternoon everyone. David Farr : Good afternoon Mark. Where are you sitting today? Mark Douglas - Longbow Research : Oh, in Cleveland. David Farr : Are the Indians going to make the playoffs this year? Mark Douglas - Longbow Research : There is a good chance but unfortunately I am a Cub\u2019s fan. David Farr : How can you be a Cubs fan in Cleveland? Mark Douglas - Longbow Research : I grew up in Chicago. David Farr : Okay, okay. I am Cardinals fan and Frank\u2019s a Yankee fan, and Pat we can\u2019t figure out exactly what he is, but he is a football fan. Frank Dellaquila : He is a football fan. David Farr : He is a football fan, but Yankees and a Cardinal fan here. I think did we win last World Series against Yankees or did you guys us Frank? Frank Dellaquila : That\u2019s been 50 years ago. David Farr : 50 years, you and I are both 50 plus years, so we both were alive back then. I heard a game; I watched it. Go ahead. Enough about baseball Mark, go ahead. Mark Douglas - Longbow Research : All right, yes. On Europe and industrial automation, I'm assuming that would've been a little better just in some of the macro date out of Europe substantially Northern seems to be a little bit better. Was it a broad pullback for you in industrial automation there or sort of regions or products that hampered the growth? David Farr : Three things. We are very strong in industrial automation in France that economy still negative. Next key market for us is Italy, I can't say how much how fair either. And the third key issue is our often our alternator business with Caterpillar, it\u2019s still pretty weak in Europe. Those three things where the three issues that hurt us in industrial automation. If we take those three out, we did very well, but unfortunately the three big things. Mark Douglas - Longbow Research : Yes related to the mix and where you have to be exposed? David Farr : Got it. We need France to comeback. We are very strong in France. Mark Douglas - Longbow Research : And the Tour didn\u2019t help you out there did it? David Farr : No, it did not. Nor did the World Cup. Mark Douglas - Longbow Research : Our network power. How is Trellis doing in network power? Are you getting the results you\u2019d expected with the improvements there and is that point to help margins, we still margin dilutive right now and what are you seeing right now (inaudible) expected? David Farr : I would say the trend line is still positive, it's not as fast. Because of the North America projects have been weaker for us the last six months but it\u2019s still positive, still doing better than last year not doing as well as we wanted to do but still doing better than last year. It's got good momentum, the profitability is good, it's not profitability from that perspective. The key issue for us is continue to try to get the North America spend and particularly financial industry which is often very good to come back up. So I would say we are still pleased with the progress we are making in Trellis. It\u2019s not as far and long as we want it to be but we are still pleased with it. Mark Douglas - Longbow Research : Okay, thank you. David Farr :  Take care have a good one, and good luck with the Cubs. It looks like they are building a pretty good farm system right now. Mark Douglas - Longbow Research : Yes let\u2019s hope. David Farr :  Yes we always like playing the Cubbies. Operator :  Next we\u2019ll hear from Jonathan Wright with Nomura. Jonathan Wright - Nomura: Hey guys a question about industrial automation for a second so I think we covered up the geographies just in February you highlighted a lot of the new product launches you had rolling down over the course of this year I see motors and drives still struggling, I would\u2019ve thought you maybe a bit of impetus from that bit of a business can you just talk about the how those products have been received I mean just tell me what you expect to see sort of going forward? David Farr :  The motors and drives part of our are doing very well on the order side. We have a lot of lock up and orders have not converted the orders in industrial automation in particular and what I call in the control technique side have been very good we just have not converted on yet the customer base is slowly converting this thing just in placing in their project they slow them down so the conversion and acceptance of their product and order run rate is very, very it\u2019s just right we got to get our end customers to convert. Jonathan Wright - Nomura: Okay and may just sticking with that I think we have talked little bit about why people aren\u2019t converting and you have mentioned sort of a political risk and the general sort of climate of nervousness around economic growth why do you see in the order growth is remaining so robust given those concerns kind of understand the weakness on the conversion side but the order growth seems quite strong considering that? David Farr :  I think a lot of it is relative to our investments and programs we have going on as we invest in sales organization and as we invest in our service and solution organization. So we are actually expanding what I would say our see and get, got and find it and get it and convert it and just the customer base is taking a little longer to convert, because I think they are little uncertain, but what I like right now is the momentum relative to the new products, the momentum on the sale side is very positive. And now we're just got to make sure the customer base continues to take the product. And I think that side 10 points very good and I can understand why the customers are getting nervous about falling things down. But I like the fact that, I would say we're increasing our penetration and we are increasing our position on a global basis, based on my order pace, that's a good sign, very good sign. Jonathan Wright - Nomura: Okay, great. Thanks guys. David Farr : Take care Jonathan. All the best to you. Operator : Moving on, we'll hear from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon, Andrew. Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a question on your CapEx spending. Where are you spending your incremental CapEx, where are you adding capacity by geography or product wise? And what are the areas that you are downsizing as long as you want that? David Farr : Okay. Relative to capacity right now, I don't think I'm taking much capacity offline. From a capacity standpoint, we\u2019re adding capacity quite a bit in Process Management and we're adding capacity in Process Management both in North U.S., U.S., Mexico, Eastern Europe and China. And then not much expansion on Industrial Automation and then in Network Power, we've been repositioning some of our North Asia assets to South Asia and then also in the Eastern Europe and probably next couple of months in Mexico. Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Are you guys expecting to see any impact from Russia sanctions in the energy sector? David Farr : If they continue to ratchet them up eventually that eventually hurt our Process Management business. And I mean as we've said in the past, we do about $0.5 billion in Russia and very much oil and gas centric, if the sanctions continue to go up and actually we\u2019re going to see, we\u2019ve been seeing our business weaker as it is anyway, so we\u2019re already starting to have the impact on in this quarter last quarter it was negative on us and I expect that to continue. Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just a follow-up question on climate Europe actually seemed to be pretty good, how does it square with your comments about Europe slowing? David Farr : Well Europe, essentially Europe I think.. Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Got it. David Farr : Now climate strength is primarily North Europe and so from the perspective of the customer base for climate, the North Europe and some of the further parts East it\u2019s been pretty good for them and they\u2019re now strong in Italy and strong in France. So the marketplace for those guys has been pretty good and the technology investments we\u2019re making for efficiency and some of the changes we\u2019re making in refrigerants have been positive for us. So different dynamics, unfortunately not all the markets were acting the same way within our company right now. Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Terrific. Thank you very much. David Farr : You\u2019re welcome Andrew. Take care now. Operator : We\u2019ll take a follow-up from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Hey sorry, just a\u2026 David Farr : You snuck in the back door, Tusa. What are you doing, are you trying to steal apples or something? Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Yes, that\u2019s my style. The Climate Tech margins are pretty good obviously 21% and you\u2019re going to end up being kind of flattish this year annually, is that a process similar the process where are you investing a lot of money there and so should we think about kind of 19%, 18.5% to 19% is a good kind of longer-term run rate? David Farr : I think for the next couple of years, I think that margins can stay about where it is right now, it could start inching up. We have a couple of major investments going on right now and variable speed, we have a couple of major investments going on the, for there is a new refrigerant and we have a major investments in some very important new product launches in the commercial states spoken China and North America that have increased our investment profile. So I think that will continue for this year or next year and potentially product fixed (inaudible). I would expect the business continues to turn well, we should be improve our profit because our mix is getting stronger, stronger towards commercial, the industrial and service space and that start to pay off as you can see some profitability. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay. So modest improvement with investment offsetting better mix. David Farr : You got it. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay. And then one last question restructuring for this year. I don't think you mentioned a number it seems like it's going to be coming in lower than the 75 million\u2026 David Farr : Up a little from 65, 70. Frank Dellaquila : 65, 70. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay. 65,70. Okay, great. Thanks a lot. David Farr : I would, if I would looking to next year Steve. I would think things you came in back door, I'd say 60 to 70. Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. David Farr : All of that and I want to thank again everybody the phone today really appreciate. Also want to thank, again operating people the deliver to quarter. Now we have to deliver for the final quarter for the year and convert that backlog and continue to grow the business. So with that, I thank everybody I wish well all the best and see you soon. Bye. Operator : And that does concludes today's teleconference. Thank you all for joining.",

Ltd., Research Division Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Emerson's investor conference call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, November 4, 2014. Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent annual report on Form 10-K as filed with SEC. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Patrick Fitzgerald, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead. Patrick Fitzgerald : Thank you, Danny. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Craig Rossman, who will be succeeding me as Director of Investor Relations in the coming weeks. Today's call summarizes Emerson's fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website at emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next 3 months. We'll start with the highlights of the quarter, as shown on Page 2 of the conference call slide presentation. Net sales were unchanged in the quarter at $6.8 billion, with underlying sales up 4%, reflecting increases in all segments, with Climate Technologies strongest. Growth was strong in North America and modest in Asia, while Europe was flat. Emerging markets improved to 5% growth after 2% growth in the third quarter, but remain mixed across regions. Profitability improvement continued, with a gross profit margin of 42.4%, up 120 basis points and secular margin up 70 basis points to 20.2%. An impairment charge of $508 million was recognized in the Chloride business, which has been impacted by protracted economic weakness since its acquisition in 2010 and a deteriorating outlook in Europe and Middle East/Africa over the next 2 to 3 years. Earnings per share of $1.30 increased 10%, excluding charges in both years. It was a strong close in fiscal 2014 with margin, earnings and cash generation exceeding expectations. Slide 3, P&L summary. As previously stated, net sales were flat, while underlying sales grew 4%, reflecting the impact of currency translation and divestitures. Gross profit margin expansion benefited from improved business and technology mix, which enabled funding of strategic investments as reflected in higher SG&A expense. The decrease in other deductions was primarily driven by cyclical currency comparisons of $43 million. Excluding charges, EBIT margin expanded 160 basis points to 20.1% with a strong contribution from segment margins and favorable stock compensation expense. Share repurchase of $267 million contributed to EPS of $1.30, up 10%. Next slide, sales by geography. In the fourth quarter, sales growth was led by the United States, up 8%, while Europe was flat, Asia grew 2%, including unchanged sales in China on challenging comparisons, Latin America increased 3%, Canada was up 10% and Middle East and Africa was up 5%. Total underlying sales increased 4% and acquisitions added 2%, while divestitures deducted 5% and currency translation deducted 1% for flat reported sales. For fiscal 2014, 4% growth in the U.S. and 7% growth in China drove the majority of the underlying sales increase. Europe and Canada were up 1%, Latin America was up 2% and Middle East and Africa declined 1%. Full year underlying sales grew 3% and acquisitions contributed 1%, while divestitures deducted 5%, for reported sales in 2014 down 1%. Strong market conditions in the U.S. and improvement in emerging markets drove higher accelerated -- excuse me, drove growth acceleration in the fourth quarter, the highest quarterly rate of growth of the year. Slide 5, segment earnings and cash flow. Segment margin expansion of 70 basis points led by strong improvement in Process Management and Industrial Automation. Lower corporate expense was primarily driven by cyclical flat comp comparisons of $54 million. Reported pretax earnings reflected the previously mentioned charge. Cash generation exceeded expectations with strong conversion and working capital management to finish the year. Trade working capital improved by 10 basis points. Next slide, Process Management. Process Management underlying sales grew 5% in the fourth quarter, with North America up 13%, Asia up 1%, Europe flat, Latin America up 3% and Middle East and Africa up 5%. Acquisitions added 4% and currency translation deducted 1% for net sales growth of 8%. Momentum continued in global energy and chemical industries with growth strongest in North America driven by robust investment in oil and gas production and processing projects. Asia was slow, as strength in Southeast Asia and India was offset by challenging comparisons in China and Australia. Europe reflected improvement in Russia, offset by lumpy project timing in the North Sea region. Market conditions in Latin America and Middle East and Africa were mixed. Margin remained strong, up 130 basis points in Q4, driving 20.9% margin for the full year. Robust order trends have resulted in double-digit year-end backlog growth providing strong momentum into 2015. Slide 7, Industrial Automation. Industrial Automation net and underlying sales increased 5% in the fourth quarter, with North America up 12%, Asia up 5%, Europe and Latin America down 2%, and Middle East and Africa down 9%. Demand for our capital goods continued to improve with mixed trends across markets and geographies. All businesses grew except for motors and drives, reflecting short-cycle economic weakness in Europe. Strength in North America was led to over 20% growth in hermetic motors business. Asia benefited from continued strength in China, particularly in the power transmission and electrical distribution businesses. Strong interest has been received in the power transmission business, and a decision is expected by end of calendar year. Very good market conditions are expected in the near term with favorable momentum in North America and Asia and soft demand in Europe. Next slide, Network Power. Network Power underlying sales increased 1%, with North America up 1%, Asia down 3%, Europe up 7%, Latin America down 2% and Middle East and Africa up 9%. The divested Artesyn and Connectivity Solutions businesses deducted 20% and currency translation deducted another 1%, for a reported sales decrease of 20%. Data center markets have gradually improved globally. Strong growth in Europe benefited from a large project in Sweden, along with better market conditions in North America and modest growth in Asia. Telecommunications infrastructure investment slowed in all geographies, declining at a double-digit rate after strong growth in the third quarter. It was a solid finish to the year on margin for the segment, up 400 basis points sequentially. As mentioned previously, we have taken that cautious economic outlook in Europe and Middle East and Africa during the next 2 to 3 years. And as a result, we have recognized an impairment charge in the Chloride business that is not reflected in the segment results. Business conditions are expected to remain mixed, with gradual improvement in the data center business, and inconsistent demand in telecommunications markets in the near term. Slide 9, Climate Technologies. Climate Technologies net and underlying sales increased 7% with North America up 7%, Asia up 8%, Europe down 3%, Latin America up 17%, and Middle East and Africa up 25%. Growth was strong globally in the air conditioning business, led by strength in the U.S., with residential up over 20%, reflecting demand driven by upcoming regulatory changes. U.S. commercial markets improved as well. International air conditioning demand was mixed, with strength in Asia, Middle East/Africa and Latin America, partially offset by declines in Europe. The refrigeration business grew moderately, led by continued strength in transportation markets. Demand for sensors and controls declined moderately. Segment margin declined with an unfavorable mix, higher investment spending and customer accommodation expense related to a manufacturing process improvement. Market conditions are expected to remain favorable with growth momentum in North America and Asia, while regulatory demand will slow. Commercial & Residential Solutions on Slide 10. Commercial & Residential Solutions net and underlying sales grew 5%, with North America up 7%, Asia up 3%, Europe down 2%, Latin America down 5% and Middle East and Africa down 22%. Strong demand in North America more than offset the slight decline in international markets. The growth was led by the professional tools, wet/dry vacuums and food waste disposer businesses. Sales increased slightly in the storage business. Segment margin remained strong at 23.2%. Solid trends in residential and commercial construction markets in North America are expected to continue, supporting a moderate growth outlook for the next year. Next slide, 2014 summary. Fiscal 2014 net sales declined 1% and underlying sales increased 3% with emerging markets up 4% and mature markets up 3%. Gross profit margin, again, reached a record level and EBIT margin of 16.5% expanded 50 basis points. EPS, excluding charges of $3.75, came in above previously communicated expectations on the strong year-end close. Emerson completed the 58th year of consecutive dividend increase supported [ph] record operating cash flow, with a payout ratio over 60% for the fourth consecutive year. Next slide, 2014 performance versus plan. Most financial targets were achieved or exceeded in the year, with gross profit margin and operating cash flow ahead of plan, EBIT margin [indiscernible] plan, and earnings per share just above the midpoint of the range. The solid operational execution of return [ph] , lower-than-expected macroeconomic growth as emerging markets, excluding China, struggled to maintain economic momentum falling short of expectations. Next slide, 2015 outlook. Underlying orders growth of 9% in the fourth quarter drove year-end backlog to a record $6.7 billion. The global macroeconomic trends mixed, but gradually improving. There continues to be solid momentum in the NAFTA region and China, with balance of increasing uncertainty in Europe and some other emerging markets. We're planning cautiously for global gross fixed investment of 3% to 4% growth next year. Based on current business conditions, the following is expected in 2015 : underlying sales growth of 4% to 5%; reported sales change of 0% to 1%; reflecting a 2% deduction from currency translation and a 2% deduction from the potential power transmission divestiture. Modest profitability improvement is expected as well. Business segment and other financial metric forecasts will be provided at our Annual Investor Conference in February 2015. Additionally, the first quarter 2015 dividend has been increased 9% to $0.47 a share, equivalent to an annual rate of $1.88 and representing 44% of 2014 free cash flow. With that, I'll turn it over to David Farr. David N. Farr: Thank you very much. First, I want to thank everybody for joining us today. We truly appreciate your interest and your support, as we continue to invest, grow and enhance the value of Emerson's long-term sustainable value. And as you all know, I have a strong focus at this company on giving money back to our shareholders. In 2014, we ended up passing back to our shareholders almost $2.3 billion, $1.2 billion of dividend and $1.1 billion in share repurchase. A focus on this Corporation to generate cash, invest that cash for growth and give the money back to the shareholders that we do not need. Today, the board did increase our dividends per share, as Pat just stated, to an annual run rate of $1.88 versus last year's $1.72. We had a very strong cash flow year. And as our targets are set up for dividends, we look at 40% to 50% of our dividend payment coming out of free cash flow and last year's free cash flow almost an all-time record, we made the decision to pass back more money to our shareholders and increase dividends to $1.88, starting our 59th straight year of dividend increases for our shareholders. As I look at -- I want to thank the operations for their strong operational performance across the board. As in any company of this size and complexity, you have some pluses, you have some minuses, but in total, the team worked hard, and they delivered. They delivered a very strong sales growth. They delivered a very strong orders growth, strong cash flow and conversion relative to their programs that we've been investing in, in the last couple of years. So we see good momentum, as we move into 2015, which we'll talk about. But the business leaders, the presidents, the global operational leaders and the corporate executives that make things happen here at Emerson got the job done, and I believe in a very uncertain environment -- global economic environment, delivered record levels of profits and earnings and cash for our shareholders. As Pat mentioned, he has given up on me, and he will be stepping aside here at the end of this calendar year, moving to Asia, working for Climate Technology. Pat has been a lot of fun to work with. Pat's had the joy of going through ups and downs of this marketplace, and my mood's up and downs and managing shareholders. And we truly appreciate what he's done for us and his insights, and we wish him well as he moves on to his next role with Climate Technology located in Asia. With that, we're bringing a senior-level player in, a relief pitcher, Craig Rossman, almost 20 years with the corporation. Craig worked for me at one time in the process world, then moved him over somewhere else, a couple of other divisions, came out of Therm-O-Disc. He's coming in from a business leader -- a business perspective. So he'll have a lot of background in business. He's not quite used to the corporate people here, and he'll have a fun time learning what it's like to work in St. Louis. But we'll welcome Craig, and he'll do a great job, and he'll bring a different perspective to the business world, given all the businesses he's been involved with in his job at Emerson for the last 20 years. As I mentioned -- as we look at the company and look at the performance this year, obviously, we can always say there's some good things, and I can equally say there's some bad things. And I know my shareholders out there, and investors are out there will gladly point out the goods and the bads. They're real good at that. But I look at the company today from where we are and where we started. And I say the company is in a stronger position today than when we started this fiscal year. We grew orders nicely. We made strategic investments. We did a couple of strong acquisitions, got a couple of divestitures done, we're in the middle of one right now, and hopefully we'll get it done sometime in the second fiscal quarter of 2015 in Power Transmission Solutions. We've improved the order run rate. We've improved our margins. We improved our profitability. We had a -- without the Chloride charge, we had [indiscernible] the return on total capital over 20% after-tax. We had a record level operating cash flow, and we had a near record in free cash flow. So operationally, yes, some good, some bad, but in total, they got it done, and they did a great job in creating a stronger company, as we go into 2015. 2015 is going to be an interesting year. We go in with a record level backlog. We go in with strong orders. We go in with record levels of profitability. We go in with strong investments. We have a very good U.S., Canada and Mexico marketplace. The NAFTA region looks very solid right now. However, this year, versus last year, we're going into a situation where Europe is weakening. Europe is clearly heading down potentially for its third recession since the 2008 peak, which is a concerning issue for global companies like Emerson and global leaders like myself. One of the reasons why, as I looked at the Chloride acquisition we made several years ago, it was hard to justify the good will out there, given the fact that I'm really concerned about the European environment for the next several years. So concerned about Europe. Well, the concern about the Eastern Europe, Middle East/Africa, they have a lot of issues going on in those regions right now, and I would say the wind has turned from our back to our face in the last 6 months, and I would expect those to be in our face for the next 6 to 12 months. In South America, I'm concerned, driven by my concern over Brazil and Venezuela, Chile, Argentina, concerns there. I think those economies are still struggling and will not give us a whole lot of growth in 2015, but will give us some growth, but not to a level I would expect in a normal economic cycle down there. Asia Pacific, in general, we had a decent year. China was very strong for us. China, we grew 7%. I would expect China to grow again next year, but not at the same level, probably closer to 5%. I expect Southeast Asia, India -- in India, India and then also Australia, to have a decent year for us in growth. But net-net, a slightly more positive global economic environment for us to operate in, though there is also more uncertainty, as I look at today's economic environment than we faced as we started this fiscal 2014. I look at underlying sales to be up slightly, in the 4% to 5% range. I see improvement in our profitability, and I see probably most likely cash flow being flat, more function around what happens with our growth rates and also what happens relative to just the overall performance of the growth around the company around the world. But clearly, running at record levels, high levels of cash flow. We'll clearly give a lot more color in the markets, as we always do in February, where we break down and give you a different underlying growth rates, what we see out there. But in general, total, I see a little bit better growth. I see a lot more concern than I did last year at this point in time. But I feel good about where we're going into with our programs, investments, and I feel good that we'll start 2015 on a good, positive foot. And clearly, we'll talk about that, as we get into February time period. We will clearly give you a lot more inputs in February. We don't always give guidance in November, contrary to what people believe. We sometimes give you pieces of the action of what's going on, but clearly, with the uncertainty that we see around the world, in particular right now in Europe, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, we're being cautious. We're being concerned, and we're being careful about what we're going to say. We'll get better clarity as we move into the next calendar year, as we move into that February time frame. Albeit, we seek better underlying growth at the top, we see margin improvement, therefore, we'll see some improvement in earnings, and we'll talk about that in February. But in the end, a solid year. Got there a little bit differently than I -- we originally thought. But it the end, it finished very nicely, very strong, good earnings per share, good cash flow. And you also noticed on the cash flow conversion, free cash earnings, we did 110% this year on top of last year's 115%. So good, high-quality earnings and from a cash flow generation and a net earnings standpoint. So I feel good about what the operations delivered. I want to thank them one more time, and we'll turn it over, to the call -- to the shareholders out there, I'm sure they have questions. They always do. And I'm sure they'll have questions that I'm not going to answer, but we'll obviously talk a little bit about those. So with that, I want to thank everybody for delivering a strong finish to 2014, and looking forward to a strong start to 2015. Thank you very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : So first -- I guess, first and foremost, on the correction in oil prices that we've seen. Obviously, you guys are carrying high levels of backlog. Order intake remains strong. What kind of feedback are you getting from your customers on any sensitivity to some of these projects, if oil stays down and what kind of duration would it need to stay down before you see risk or your customers see risk to some of these bigger projects? David N. Farr: It's -- I mean, clearly, there's not one simple answer here in this, Josh. It is a concern to us. It's a concern from our customer base, when I talk to them. There is not just one number. But clearly, as this price of oil drops down into the 70s, there's a concern that they will start slowing down some of the incremental new projects from the standpoint of what they do next. So my concern will be, as their concern is, that the price of oil continues to slip down into the 60s, into the 50s, and it goes that low, that clearly, that would cause them to really start pulling back on their spending, which will obviously impact us in a significant way. We'll see it -- we'll start seeing this in the, I would say, early 2015 calendar quarter, if the price of oil stays down. I think it needs to stay down for at least 30 days to 60 days, depending on the type of -- the oil and gas, which they're going after. But clearly right now, with this downward slope in the price of oil, it is a concern relative to our core businesses and where the money is being spent. So a little bit nervous about that at this point in time, and a lot of volatility. So flags are up and we're going to watch it very carefully. And if we have to modulate our spending and things like that, we'll obviously, clearly, start doing that. But it won't take long. We'll know early on in that first calendar quarter where things are trending. Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Got you. That's helpful. And then, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about capital return to shareholders. I guess, one thing that you guys have always wrestled with is some of the trapped cash. Been discussion that if certain things go right politically tonight, that maybe there's some tax holidays and repatriation. Have you guys thought about what you might do if you get better access to the international cash? David N. Farr: We'd bring it back, and I would say the number would have a 2 in front with a B in the back side of it. And so we take that money, we bring over $2 billion back into the United States. And we invest it here in the United States. I would give some back to our shareholders and we, internally, we invest it. And so clearly, that would be a positive, positive source of cash for U.S. companies, if we're able to bring that back at a reasonable tax rate. Let's say they have a 5%, 6%, 7% -- 7% tax rate on that, you'd see that money come back in into the United States and get invested in this country and passed back to our shareholders. Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : You think bulk goes to internal investment? Or back to shareholders? Or is that a nebulous question still? David N. Farr: That's a nebulous -- yes, yes, that's a nebulous question. I'll be very, it's -- some of it will go internally. I mean, obviously, what we see right now is the stronger North America, which means there's going to be more investments. And so if I had that cash versus going to a commercial paper market, clearly, I'd use that cash to invest. It's not going to drive incremental investment per se, but it will obviously -- we know that money will go to use here in the United States because of the strong U.S. environment we see right now, for both growth and investment. So it would be a good thing for the U.S. economy because you invest the dollars into capital, it's going to create jobs. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : On Process, what's the profile of the order base at this point between upstream, midstream, downstream? How would you characterize that? David N. Farr: I couldn't give you the number off the top of my head. I -- it's not a number I'd see. I mean, clearly, we're involved in all aspects of that, but I don't have the number off the top of my head. I mean, some of the large projects, obviously, are upstream, from an investment standpoint, relative to go in and get the gas and go in and get the oil. But right now, let's say, we're still predominantly downstream across the board. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. All right. And then, when you look at CapEx, the -- almost $770 million this year, I mean, are you expecting a slight increase next year? How are you thinking about spending? David N. Farr: We're looking at -- right now, our target all year long was going to be somewhere around $775 million to $800 million. We got a little bit under $800 million at $776 million. I would say, next year, the target is going to be somewhere in the $800 million, $825 million. We still have some investments we're making on our global reach and other investments. So at this point in time, we're looking to spend around $800 million to $825 million. That's about as close as I can call it. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then, on Climate, with the pull-forward here with the regulatory stuff, I assume that's going to hit mostly in the fiscal Q1, maybe a little bit in the calendar Q1. But how would you characterize the growth rate here? I would assume you'd see a pretty strong growth number here in the fiscal Q1 number -- quarter? David N. Farr: The pull-up due to the efficiency change is going to place on January 1. The production has to be produced by our customer, the carriers, the terrains, the [indiscernible]. It has to be produced by 12/31/14. So we'll see all -- our pull-up impact will be done within -- by the end of November, early December. So it will be all finished. And then, we'll start seeing the payback in some of that -- the drop-off in our second quarter and our third quarter, as we go into 2015, which would be the first and second calendar quarter. And that's how we're going to see it at this point in time. And the overall growth rate, I think -- we'll talk about it. But the overall growth rate right now we're looking at, I mean, if you look through the cycle, it looks to me -- I think it's going to be mid to upper single-digit for North America this year. It's the best I can tell. It's a function of what happens to some of the housing, but right now, it's a, 5% to 10% type of range. Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then helps your leverage here in fiscal Q1, if I -- in terms of climate, right? You should get some pretty good operating leverage. David N. Farr: Yes, that would clearly help us from our -- yes, the cost absorption standpoint, we're usually -- at this point in time, our plants are at the lowest level. And then, we're starting -- now we're going to be running at the highest level. And then, unfortunately, will give some of that back in the second, third quarter because of what happens as demand goes down. But that's what's going to happen. It's going to be a little bit different forecast in our view of Climate Technology in 2015. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Douglass with Longbow Research. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC : [indiscernible] years of starting -- what's that? David N. Farr: No, go head. I'm sorry, I didn't know. I thought I might have lost you, but go ahead. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. After a couple of years of starting the year thinking we're going to go one direction and then it tends to slow, you said in your prepared remarks that your 3% to 4% GFI growth is considered conservative. I mean, in light of what we've been seeing and your comments on Europe, it doesn't feel particularly conservative. Can you kind of square that circle a little bit? David N. Farr: I mean, if you look at -- [indiscernible] forecasts out there are still higher than those numbers. And so I -- we've been trying to figure out how to make adjustments. So I mean, if you look at our forecast right now for, what I would say the fixed investment around the world, it's still -- the number would still be higher than that number. So that's where I'm coming from. And obviously, Europe is definitely weakening and I'm concerned about that, but just the underlying forecast that I see right now is a little bit lower than the economists would say. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Looking at Process and the margins, a couple of things. On the acquisitions, Virgo, Enardo, were they dilutive in the year? And if so, by how much? And then, next year, qualitatively, do you think your investment spending keeps pace with sales growth? Or would we expect at least a little bit of margin expansion? David N. Farr: We'll let Frank -- Frank's got it. Frank J. Dellaquila: Mark, the acquisitions were not dilutive. They actually were slightly accretive even after the purchase accounting charges that we took when we first acquired them. So they were good high-margin companies that we bought. David N. Farr: And what was the second part of that question, the capital spend, you said? Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC : No, no, no. On your investment spending, within Process, would you allow Process margins to expand next year? Or do you think investment -- you've had a lot of investment spending in Process and... David N. Farr: Yes, I would say, right now -- Process is running, they're running at pretty good margin level. We're going to -- we'll look at, obviously, the mix comes into play a lot here. What markets are up and down, but their growth investments were going to be pretty well -- I would say a little -- their growth investments going to be a little less than the sales growth. And then, a function of the margin, slightly plus or minus, about the same, there's not going to be much change there. It's really a function of what mix is -- is North America, good? You have a couple of big projects. So it's always hard to dial in the margin for Process, but Process is going to be running at higher levels of margins with their growth investments trending down just a little bit slower than the underlying sales growth. Operator : Our next question is from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I wanted to say thank you to Pat for all the help. In terms of the overall kind of incremental margins, you've said before that at 4% organic sales growth, you should get a very good operating leverage. And I guess, your guidance for the year ahead is for 4% to 5% organic growth, but the leverage, it doesn't sound as if it's quite there. So maybe just explain what's happening there to drive only kind of modest earnings improvement? David N. Farr: One, we're looking at continuing to invest in the businesses across the company. And secondly, right now, when I talk about stronger leverages, you get a little bit as you get forward and you get, obviously, greater as you go up towards 5-plus percent. So right now, Julian, I'm a little bit nervous going back to the questions we've had about some of the mix around the world and some of the oil and gas investments. So we're being -- we're just being very cautious about what type or level of profitability we see at this point in time and not make commitments on the profitability that we don't feel we can deliver. It's just a cautious outlook and concern about and what we're seeing out there, as we go into 2015, which is a completely different world, in my opinion, than we -- when we saw -- when we saw going into 2014. Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Got it. And in terms of the overall incremental investment, 6 to 12 months ago, you talked about $110 million step-up company-wide in 2014. Just wondered where did that number end up for the year as a whole, and what are you initially thinking for fiscal '15 on that extra spend? David N. Farr: It was within a couple of million dollars of that. I mean, we don't track it that tightly. It's about the same level, when I look at where the money was spent, and I would say that, that number is going to go up pretty much in line with what we're seeing right now for sales. So if sales are going up 4% or 5%, we're looking at probably increasing that number 4% to 5% next year, incrementally. We're looking at some key programs, which are multiple-year programs, to make sure that we invest in those programs at this point in time. And we move it around the various businesses to make sure we're making the right investments. Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And then, lastly, just thinking about the earnings growth year-on-year, you've given us sort of an indication of where you're thinking for the year as a whole. But is it fair to say that you'll start the year at a much stronger rate than for the full year? And then you're kind of embedding some tail off in the second half? David N. Farr: I would expect -- right now, we're expecting the year to be -- I would hope to see in the first half that it would be a little bit better than the total year, but I do expect a slowdown in some of the businesses. I'm a little bit nervous relative to some of the longer-cycle business if the price of oil continues to weak -- go down, and we start seeing the knock-on effect of some of the economies around the world continue to weaken. So my concern is that we will have a better growth rate in the first half and it will definitely weaken in the second half. Operator : Next, we have Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Just a question. So you outlined how 2014 played out versus plan by geography. And I was just wondering, given that you're repositioning the company to sort of focus on new areas of growth, the fact that U.S. continues to be one of the fastest-growing areas, does that accelerate anything internally in terms of how you're thinking spending money internally and which businesses to push forward? David N. Farr: It did last year. We started accelerating North America spending about 18 months ago, and we'll continue to do -- we'll continue to invest more in North America. That's therefore -- if we were able to bring some cash back in, you'd see a lot of that cash get invested in North America. So I would say -- but I see right now, the NAFTA region looks very good here for the next couple of years. And so we're continuing to increase our investments in the NAFTA region. And some regions, we're actually scaling back, installing those growth rates down or maybe what I'd say disinvesting a little bit. Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : But the question on North America, are you thinking about accelerating versus the original plan? Or are we still on track versus what we thought? David N. Farr: We're pretty well on track. I don't think North America is -- North America is trending pretty much like we thought it would trend. I mean, we saw this coming, and I'd still think it's going to keep trending that way. So from our perspective, we're not going to accelerate any faster than we already had laid out the last couple of years. So we're pretty well right there. Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Can you -- I don't know if you can talk about it, but what's your underlying assumption about the run rate of business in Russia over the next year? I was assuming it's -- and I'm not asking you to comment on what's happening in Russia, but what's built into your forecast? David N. Farr: Our forecast is Russia will be down next year. We've had a decent run, but obviously -- clearly, our business will be impacted by what's going on from all of the restrictions being put on Russia. So our forecast right now is Russia will be down in 2015. Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : But do you make any assumptions about the run rate of the projects in Russia? Or this is just your compliance with the sanctions? Or maybe we can just simply take it offline, it's getting too complex? But any more color beyond that? David N. Farr: No, we just -- we just look at where the money investment is going and what's going to happen, and we know what projects we're involved with. It's not -- we can figure that out. It's nothing to do necessary -- it's just, we see what's happening in our customer base and the lack of cash and it reached some of the restrictions and sanctions. And so we have a feel for what our business is going to do next year, and it's going to be lower. Operator : Our next question is from Jeremie Capron with CLSA. Grace Lee - CLSA Limited, Research Division : This is Grace Lee sitting in for Jeremie Capron. I have a -- we have a question for Network Power. It seems that Network Power seems to have the weakest outlook for 2015, not so surprisingly. So I'm wondering whether you could tell us how you think about the attractiveness of that asset in going-forward basis? And also, it would be great if you can share some of the metrics that you track in order to evaluate that business? David N. Farr: We track the same metrics we track that business. We track all businesses. Growth, profitability, cash and returns. So those metrics are the same ones. And from my expectations right now, Network Power has continued to make progress. It's clearly not as much progress as we would like to see. We have certain markets which are struggling and particularly, I'm very concerned about the European and Eastern Europe and Middle East. So yes, I'm concerned about it. I look for decent growth next year, and I look for improvement in profitability. So right now, I have solid expectations. And as I've told the outside world, we continuously evaluate that. And at this point in time, I still believe, over the next couple of years, we can create incremental value for our shareholders from where we are. So that's where we sit. Grace Lee - CLSA Limited, Research Division : I see. Just one follow-up. If the business doesn't pan out in a way that you expected at this point, would you consider some aggressive changes in the portfolio structure? David N. Farr: The answer is yes, we do that -- yes we do that at Emerson. We do look at businesses -- getting out of businesses, and if we feel like they cannot create the value for our shareholders, Emerson is not reluctant to do that, and we've divested a lot of businesses under my 14 years of CEO leadership. And I guarantee you that we will continue to evaluate that, and we'll continue to evaluate all businesses, if they're not going to create value for our shoulders, we'll get out of them. It's a part of doing business. Operator : Next, we have Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : So just first on Climate. What -- could you just describe what you mean by customer accommodation expense? David N. Farr: Yes. Very easy. We changed a coating on our motor to reduce rust inside the compressor. And by doing that, we created a chemical reaction within the new refrigerant and the new process and with a new electronic expansion valves. It created a clogging. So they had some failures out in the marketplace. And so we've had to work with our customer base to figure out how to compensate them, and so that's what we do. And we had to take a charge in the fourth quarter to -- in anticipation of what that's going to cost. But while it's not around, actually, a quality improvement in the product end, it clearly -- it backfired a little bit with the new expansion valve, electronic expansion valves, and also the new refrigerant chemicals. So it's one of the things we tested for and we missed it. Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And then, that's a resi dynamic? David N. Farr: Yes. Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Resi related? David N. Farr: Oh, yes. Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then, just on the geographic guide. I mean, you talked about China being a little bit weaker, Southeast Asia being a little bit better, Europe being weaker. I mean, it looks like that incrementally, there are not too many geographies that are actually getting better this year. So to get from the 3% to the 4% to 5% underlying, is that just backlog conversion? I'm just trying to reconcile that. David N. Farr: I think the NAFTA region, which last time I saw North America was still our largest market. I'm actually having a little bit faster growth rate next year. So that's how I square the circle. Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I got it. And then, one last question, just on the -- on kind of the order flow here. You talked about Process potentially slowing down. You're obviously going to have the tougher comps in Climate. I mean, is it possible that the orders have been pretty strong up kind of the high single-digits here? Is it possible that in the second quarter, that those orders could go negative because of those comps? Or is there enough going on in the rest of the business where the orders can kind of hold up here, in a reasonable way? David N. Farr: I mean, it's always possible -- Steve, it's hard for us to map out the trend line of orders, but if you look at the order trend last year, I would say that there is a chance that we can have a negative 3-month roll or negative quarter. I'd say the answer is always positive, Steve. I mean, always, potentially yes. I haven't mapped them out per se, but if I look at the trend line knowing where it came up, I would say there's a chance you could see that, just like you potentially could see it in the -- you could see it in the -- the next fourth quarter could have a problem, too. Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : One last quickie. You gave an EPS range last year of 4% to 7%, the margin comment is slight improvement. Could you maybe just provide a little bit of context around kind of EPS dynamics and if there's some moving parts here around pension and there's a little bit of share count benefit all that kind of stuff... David N. Farr: It will grow next year. Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Earnings will grow next year? David N. Farr: Earnings will grow next year. I'm not going to give any more, Steve. Earnings will grow next year. Operator : Our next question is from John Baliotti from Janney Capital Markets. John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : I just had a -- if we kind of go up in altitude, I was just -- if you take a step back, I know we, as a practice, take out onetime charges, nonrecurring events to look at the underlying business. But as you pointed out being CEO for 14 years, there's been a number of these, I guess, events, over the last couple of years, deals that were done before you were CEO. And I'm just curious, in terms of going forward, what kind of governors have you been able to put in place? So, to mitigate the risk. Obviously, global things change, there's not a lot you can do about that. Currency moves around, but given what you've learned over the last 14 years, what have you added to the due diligence process as you look to deploy capital going forward? David N. Farr: I think a couple of issues from the standpoint of, I would say, from different technologies. I think we're looking today at more of an industry that will be, obviously, less volatile and from a technology standpoint. There's always been a trade-off of how we tried to figure out how to drive a little bit faster growth and sometimes you take a little bit more risk. And so I think we spent a lot more time around that issue, John, after the impact of the charges which have been very painful for the management team, including myself and the board. So I -- we spent a lot more time around that risk and the volatility and the reward or the downside from that standpoint on the charge. And secondly, I would say that if you look at where we've been making acquisitions the last several years, we've been focusing more on the industrial, the Climate and the Process sides. So I think we've changed our profile a little bit to where we've been making our acquisitions. John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Okay, great. And just as a follow-up. On -- obviously, currency is beyond your control, but what kind of, just academically, what do you think on a reported revenue base, if we used the context of modest improvement in margins, what would you see as a, let's say, as an inflection point in reported growth that would -- given the investments you've made in the businesses over the years that would kind of step that up? In terms of the [indiscernible]... David N. Farr: Not from a currency standpoint. You just take an underlying margin profitability standpoint... John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Yes, so if you're saying 4% to 5% core growth. Obviously, currency is nothing you can control, so you lose a couple of points there. You're going to lose a couple of points in divestitures. But if including those things, you were able to have a reported growth of a of couple points higher, how much higher do you think -- would you need to get to the 4% to 5% on a reported basis to get a nice -- a more significant improvement in profitability? Or could it be a little bit less? David N. Farr: It's gonna to be more in the 5% range before to get that type of leverage point from the standpoint of what we see at this point, given where we are. Given we're running at profit margins that, I would say, last time I saw were record levels. And so I would say that we have to get above that 5% range to really have a nice leverage point, but it's -- just from the standpoint of -- unless I wanted to dial back the long term investments, which we have not done because we feel quite strongly that over the long term making those investments will strengthen our position in the market leadership, which we are today. We're a stronger company than -- today in the short term, thinking I could cut, I could cut, I could cut, and I think, then, I would have a much weaker company and then you have a whole different situation in your hands. John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Right. And so obviously, the working capital comes down through that, your cash flow, all those things are -- positively benefit from that? David N. Farr: Yes. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Peter Lennox-King: This is Peter Lennox-King on for Steve. Just a couple of questions. The first one being on -- could you talk about the release of your backlog and in terms of timing across the segments and how that links to expectations for revenue growth given that you were talking about H1 probably being a bit stronger than H2 in 2015? David N. Farr: I -- from the perspective of Network Power backlog, it's historically within -- we expect that backlog to come out in the first and second quarter. I mean, obviously we also expect the order rate to keep growing, too. So -- and we see it Network Power growing next year. And if the order rate keeps growing, I wouldn't be surprised that the backlog doesn't keep growing because backlog will grow with your orders if you have a vibrant business. On the process side, historically, you would start seeing that backlog be eaten away here in the first half. [indiscernible] would expect that to happen this year. And then, again, it will start building back up as the order pace picks back up in second half of the year. Those are the 2 big backlog players. I mean, Industrial Automation and Climate are smaller backlog and those typically will come out within -- Climate comes out within 2 or 3 months and Industrial Automation usually within 3 to 4 months, 5 months. Peter Lennox-King: Great. And could you talk about -- have you been seeing any changing in pricing -- price versus [indiscernible] in the order book? David N. Farr: No. Pricing has pretty been -- pretty consistent all year long. From the standpoint, our price cost has been pretty consistent all year long, our net material inflation. And that tells you that the marketplace is not growing all that rapidly. And I would say with the -- on the flip side, the oil price dropping, that'll obviously put -- help our net material inflations. And so, right now, we're slightly positive in price and slightly negative on net material inflation, so we're doing okay. So the price cost is fine. And we haven't seen any changes there. Peter Lennox-King: And then, finally, could you -- do you have any early returns on order trending by segment through October that you could share with us? David N. Farr: No. Nothing yet. Nothing at this point in time. Operator : Our next question is from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Jiayan Zhou - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : This is Jiayan, filling in for Nigel. One, just quickly, on the power transmission divestiture, would you guys use the proceeds to buy back shares, that what you usually do? And if so, do you effectively offset a dilution by year-end '15? David N. Farr: The answer is yes. We are expecting to do that, and it will -- based on what we're -- based on the expectations that we will -- we want to make those dilutions by the time we finish the fourth quarter. So yes and yes. Jiayan Zhou - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay, great. That's helpful. And a second one, just a quick follow-up, on climate margins. So in the press release you called out some unfavorable mix impact. Just wondering if that's related to the [indiscernible] previewed? And if so, should we expect this headwind to continue into 1Q '15? David N. Farr: No, I think -- there are 2 things that are going on in the margin in the fourth quarter. We had -- our Asia business was very strong, and it is slightly lower-margin. And our North America, obviously, with the customer accommodation, that hurt us from a margin standpoint. So that's been -- that's assuming we've got everything sized like we believe we have it sized. That's behind us now in the fourth quarter. And so I think from a profitability standpoint for Climate next year, we'll probably look at getting back to where we were trending on a positive way and so we should be fine. Maybe a slight improvement in profitability at Climate, based on a total year number. Jiayan Zhou - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay, great. Just lastly, can you share some initial thoughts on gross investment and restructuring spending for fiscal '15? David N. Farr: The growth investments will probably be up from the -- up, I think, it was 110 last year, it will probably be about like 4% or 5%. Restructuring spending will be down slightly. I'm talking about -- I mean, nuance. What did we finally spent last year, Frank? Frank J. Dellaquila: $52 million. David N. Farr: $52 million? Frank J. Dellaquila: Yes. David N. Farr: So I would look at -- if I pick a number, I'd pick $50 million, nice round number. The restructuring next year would be $50 million. I mean, it could be -- if we had something pop-up, it may go to $60 million. And so right now, maybe $50 million to $55 million, something right around there. So was it $63 million? Frank J. Dellaquila: No, it was at $50 million. David N. Farr: Okay, $50 million, okay. [indiscernible] $55 million. Okay. Operator : Our next question is from Jonathan Wright with Nomura Securities. Jonathan Wright - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : So in the release you called out a significant favorable currency comparisons in the Process Management segment. I was wondering how much of the 130 basis points of margin improvement there was from the currency? Frank J. Dellaquila: It was a pretty significant portion of that in the quarter. We had a lot of current -- transactional currency inside of the businesses. So it was a significant portion of that improvement. Jonathan Wright - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : Was that related to the weaker euro? What's -- what drives that? Frank J. Dellaquila: Partially, it relates to the euro, but it has to do with various contracts they have in place with customers. So it's really a number of currencies, not even predominantly the euro, but the A dollar, the Sing dollar, the Brazil, it's a number of currencies where they have contracts denominated into third currencies. It's kind of a complicated accounting thing, but it is -- it just flushed through to be a positive in the fourth quarter. David N. Farr: If you go back and look at it -- if you go back and look at the quarter, Q2 was a big negative. So it moves around and it's almost impossible to forecast. Jonathan Wright - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : And that's a one-off impact then we shouldn't expect stronger U.S. dollar over the first 3 quarters of next year to have a similar impact on Process margins? David N. Farr: I don't think so. We don't plan on it. It really is a function, as Frank was saying, it's a function of where we get the contracts and which currencies move against us or are positive both ways. And sometimes, some years, it hurts us, some years that help us, some quarters that helps us, it hurts us, it's -- it just had to be one of those quarters where the contracts flipped the right way for us. And it's almost impossible to forecast. Jonathan Wright - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : Okay, great. And then, on the corporate line, the first half of 2014, you had a number of one-off items in there. The acquisition costs in Process, for the Process acquisitions. The others and restructuring charge, is there any reason or is there any offsets to a sort of a $50 million reduction in corporate, in 2015? Frank J. Dellaquila: Yes. We'll have some headwinds that partially offset that in '15. Pension will be slightly higher, we'll have equity comp, which will be slightly higher. So we wouldn't expect to see all of that flow through in '15 versus '14. Jonathan Wright - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : Okay, great. And if I just squeeze one more in, if you don't mind. On Industrial Automation, you called up the hermetic motors business up 20% plus, but overall motors and drives down. Is there any -- I know that business is more levered to Europe, but is there anything else going on there, any sort of competitive dynamics sort of weighing on motors and drives as a whole? David N. Farr: No. It's primarily driven via the Middle East and Western Europe. They have a very strong presence there. It was a very difficult marketplace for them. And that's what caused them. Operator : At this time, we have no further questions in our queue. I'd like to turn it over to our speakers for any closing and additional remarks. David N. Farr: Thank you very much. Again, I want to thank everybody for joining us today. Again, thanks, Pat, for the last several years working with us, and I'm looking forward to working with Ross. And appreciate everyone joining us, and thank all the operational people out there delivering '14 and looking forward to have another strong 2015. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. We appreciate everyone's participation.",

[Operator Instructions]. This conference is being recorded today, February 3, 2015. Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent annual report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Craig Rossman, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. David Farr : Before Craig starts, this is David Farr. I just want to make sure that everyone realizes this is Craig's first day on the job here and first quarterly announcement. So go easy on him out there and just try not to get too upset and write nasty comments. You can pick on me. You can pick on Frank. But go easy on Craig and his first time. We'll get him next time. Craig, it's all yours and congratulations and welcome aboard. Craig Rossman : All right. Thank you, David. Today's call will summarize Emerson's first quarter 2015 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on the Emerson's website at Emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next 90 days. I will start with the highlights of the quarter, as shown on slide 2 of the presentation. Net sales were unchanged at $5.6 billion with underlying sales up 6% in the quarter. Underlying sales increased in all business segments with Climate Technologies being the strongest, up 17%. The Americas exhibited strong growth in the quarter with mixed results in other regions. Emerging markets grew by 5%. Gross profit margin increased 90 basis points to 40.8%, while segment margins were up 60 basis points to 15%. First quarter earnings per share were $0.75, representing a 15% increase over prior-year and a 4% increase above the consensus. Share repurchases accelerated to $518 million in the quarter and the previously announced divestiture of Power Transmission Solutions closed on January 30. The first quarter was a solid start to the year, despite an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic environment, due to a strong U.S. dollar, the significant decline in oil prices and the continued weakness in Europe. Turn to slide 3 for the first quarter P&L summary. Net sales were flat to prior year while GP improved 90 basis points including the effect of portfolio repositioning and efficiency gains. EBIT increased 210 basis points which included favorable currency transactions of $19 million. Turning to slide 4, underlying sales growth in the quarter was up 6%, offset by 3% declines from both currency translations and divestitures. The United States and Canada reflected strong market conditions, up 8% and 21%, respectively, while trends in other regions were mixed. Turning to slide 5, business segment margin expansion was led by Climate Technologies and Process Management, while also including the effect of portfolio repositioning. Favorable comparisons in corporate expenses resulted in a $74 million decrease versus the prior year. Lower operating cash flow reflected primarily timing of working capital investment to aid underlying sales growth in the quarter. Trade working capital improved 50 basis points versus the prior year. Turning to slide 6 for the Process Management segment results. Process Management underlying sales grew by 6% with a 3% reduction from currency translation, resulting in net sales growth of 3% in the quarter. Sales growth was strongest in North America, up 9%, led by downstream and MRO investment. Demand in Asia was mixed, up 1% with growth in India and China offset by weakness in Australia and Southeast Asia. Europe grew 4% as double-digit growth in emerging countries offset modest declines in mature markets. Latin America reflected robust growth with sales up 26% in the quarter. Conditions in the Middle East/Africa were mixed with sales down 1%. Segment margins improved 40 basis points, reflecting favorable currency transactions. Order trends have remained solid and backlog is strong, despite an uncertain outlook in the process industry. Turn to slide 7 for Industrial Automation segment results. Industrial Automation underlying sales grew by 4% in the quarter offset by a 4% reduction from currency translation, resulting in net sales that were flat to prior year. Strength in North America was reflected with sales up 13%. The increase was led by growth of over 20% in the HVAC-related hermetic motors business. The electrical distribution and power transmission solutions businesses reported strong growth with the fluid automation business down modestly. The declines in power generating alternators and motors and drives businesses reflected continued economic weakness in Europe which was down 8%. Overall, Asia grew by 5%, benefiting from robust growth in Japan coupled with solid results in China. Order rates in power generating alternators are expected to slow further as increased pressure from lower oil prices reduces spending in the upstream oil and gas market. We expect market conditions to remain mixed in the near term with favorable trends in North America and continued weakness in Europe. Turning to slide 8 for Network Power segment results. Network Power underlying sales grew by 1% in the quarter, offset by a 3% reduction from currency translations and a 12% reduction from divestitures, resulting in net sales decrease of 14% versus the prior year. The data center business was up slightly, reflecting mixed market conditions with strong growth in Europe, benefiting from a hyperscale project in Sweden, while growth in North America was offset by Asia, Latin America and Middle East/Africa. The telecommunications infrastructure business declined at a double-digit rate with growth in Asia offset by weakness in other regions. U.S. telecommunications customers have curtailed spending referencing uncertainty surrounding potential changes in federal regulations. The margin increase of 70 basis points reflects the impact of divestitures. Demand is expected to remain mixed in the near term with favorable data center market conditions and reduced levels of telecommunications investment. Turn to slide 9 for Climate Technologies segment results. Climate Technologies underlying sales grew by 17% with a 2% reduction from currency translation. Net sales increased 15% as U.S. regulatory changes that went into effect on January 1 drove residential HVAC customers to build inventory ahead of the deadline. Commercial HVAC grew at an upper single-digit rate which was led by North America. Global refrigeration had modest growth as strength in the U.S. and Asia was partially offset by a decrease in Europe. The demand for sensors and controls businesses was flat. Segment margins increased 40 basis points primarily from leverage on the increased sales volume. Second quarter order trends in the U.S. will be uncertain until customers consume inventory that was built in the current quarter. Market conditions are expected to remain favorable, driven by end user demand with continued momentum in North America and Asia. Turn to slide 10 for the Commercial and Residential Solutions segment results. Commercial and Residential Solutions underlying sales grew by 4% with a 1% reduction from currency translation resulting in net sales growth of 3%. Market conditions were mixed with increased demand in the Americas and Middle East/Africa, while Asia and Europe were down. Increased sales were led by solid growth in professional tools with moderate increases in wet/dry vacuums and food waste disposer businesses. The commercial and residential storage businesses decreased modestly. Segment margin remains strong at 21.5%, up 10 basis points versus the prior year. As we continue to assess our portfolio, we recently initiated the evaluation process of a potential divestiture of the Intermetro business. We expect favorable trends in the U.S. residential and commercial construction markets to continue in the near term. Slide 11 contains our 2015 outlook and guidance. The current state of the global macroeconomic environment is mixed with favorable trends in North America contrasting weakness in Europe and other emerging markets. As we consider the outlook for 2015, we note three main concerns. First, the strength of the U.S. dollar which will continue to be a significant headwind. Second, the continued weakness in Europe which has not recovered from the global recession of 2008-2009, as well as weakness in other emerging markets. And third, the rapid and sustained decline in oil prices which will be primarily felt in the second half of our FY \u201815. Given our concerns, we have decided to accelerate a restructuring to approximately $100 million which will allow for a selective repositioning of our cost structure. Based on these current business conditions, the following is expected in 2015; underlying sales growth of 3% to 5%, a net sales decline of negative 1% to negative 4% reflecting a 4% to 5% deduction from currency translation and a 2% deduction from divestitures. Profitability is expected to continue to improve modestly from favorable mix and accelerated restructuring. The expected range of reported EPS is $4.50 to $4.60. This guidance includes a significant reduction from currency translation, an estimated divestiture gain of $0.75 per share and accelerated restructuring costs of $0.05 per share. Additional business segment guidance will be provided at our annual investor conference on February 19. Now, I'll turn it over to Mr. David Farr. David Farr : Thank you very much, Craig. Great job. Much smoother voice and delivery than Craig \"who\" Fitzgerald, who's, by the way, doing a great job in one of our process businesses now in Louisville and having a fun job back into operations. I'm sure he's enjoying that today. Again, I want to thank everybody for joining us. I appreciate your time. We had a very solid start to the new fiscal year with 6% underlying sales growth. But as I say, the challenge is now beginning. With the dramatic drop-off in oil prices and the resulting capital spending which we'll talk about when we meet in later this month in February, continued weakness in Europe and their only address at this point in time is to weaken the currency relative to doing real structural reform. The global weakening currencies in emerging markets as these currencies are trying to adjust to figure out how to get growth in a global slowdown. And clearly, a stronger dollar are going to hurt a lot of our exporting customers here in North America as they have problems competing around the world with a stronger dollar. Consequently, we decided to accelerate restructuring. The world's clearly changing from the last conversation we had in November with a lot of moving dynamics, but fundamentally as we see it today, we see a much slower global growth and we're concerned that there's not a lot of momentum relative to turning that growth around potentially for a couple years. So we feel it's very appropriate to rebalance our SG&A headcount on a global basis. We balance our global manufacturing and get our cost structure in-line with what we see as a slower marketplace and a changing marketplace as the whole world rebalances with the relative currency changes, the lower energy costs and the uncertainty relative to some of the major economies in the world, be it Europe, be it China, be it Brazil. We know how to do restructuring. We had built in $50 million originally in our plan and we feel quite significantly upping this to include another at least $50 million, maybe a little bit more and to get on this right away, to help our second half of calendar year 2015 margins. Also, to help 2016 which is very important to get on with this and we're taking action today and we will continue to accelerate this. From my perspective, we will continue to drive the necessary investments to accelerate our growth, to improve our growth. Growth will be still challenging, but we're going to grow. I still feel comfortable saying our underlying growth rate's going to be in the 3% to 5% range. Clearly, it's not as strong as we thought it was just six months ago with the global dynamics, but we still feel it's pretty solid. We have a strong backlog. Our profitability is running at record levels. The restructuring's going to allow us to help us protect some of that profitability in the dynamic economies around the world. There are some pluses out there in the world that I think with lower energy prices, you're going to see some of the emerging markets accelerate growth late 2015 and going into 2016. In addition, a lot of these emerging markets have actually lowered their currency valuations to make themselves more competitive. So repositioning right now makes a lot of sense because you're going to see some of these markets, the India, the China, other parts of the world where lower energy costs are going to help them be more competitive at the same time they have reduced their currency value which will give them the ability to be more competitive. As you know, we're extremely strong in emerging markets position today already from a manufacturing standpoint, a selling standpoint and our ability to compete. So I feel it's very appropriate to take action and deal with the issues facing us right now and figure out how to drive growth, at the same time to protect our profitability in the uncertain world. We will have the benefit of lower commodities which helps us from a net material inflation standpoint in the near term. Potentially in [inaudible] that will start reversing as we'll start seeing other pricing pressures. We have the benefit of some of our emerging market positions to be able to accelerate and be competitive on a global basis from an export standpoint and be in our strong position there. So a very strong position from which to protect our growth and protect our profitability. From a cash flow standpoint, for the year, we're still looking at the range of $3.7 billion operating cash flow. This does not include the impact of a loss of cash and the divestiture of power transmission business which is done, also the tax impact of that which will have an impact on the cash flow on a reporting basis. Cash flow is generally going to be solid again this year. Capital spending is going to be around $800 million as we continue to invest in new products, as we continue to invest in our global footprint and make sure we stay competitive. We'll get into the segments and what we see in each of the segments in our February meeting coming on February 19 in New York City, but from my perspective right now, we had a good start to the year. We see some issues out there. We're dealing with these issues. We're accelerating restructuring. We're making sure our cost position stays at the right level and taking those actions allowing us to address some issues that had built up in the last several years and we're going to deal with those. At the same time, I feel we still have some strong underlying growth opportunities. We just have to be very nimble and very quick and figure out where those are and make sure we can see growing the company. The company is very strong at this point in time and we're going into the second quarter in a decent position, but the winds clearly have shifted and we'll talk a lot more about that on February 19. I want to thank all the businesses out there for delivering a solid first quarter and I want to thank the businesses for taking very strong action so quickly on the restructuring which a lot of it is going to occur over the next two or three months which is very, very important, impacting 1000 SG&A people and impacting at least 1000 hourly people around the world. So with that, open the line up to take questions and look forward to seeing everybody on February 19th in New York. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to John Inch with Deutsche Bank. John Inch : Dave, could you dig in a little bit to China business trends? You guys are a pretty good read on a lot of those puts and takes in that market and the macro suggests slowing, certainly construction doesn't look great. You guys had a tough compare. Just what are you seeing and what's your outlook there? David Farr : My expectation in China right now is that it will be slower in 2015 than it was in 2014. We had a very good year in 2014. Obviously, the underlying economics have weakened. China started out very slow. We did have some tough comparisons, but just the overall pace of business was more challenging. I do think that it's going to grow low single-digit. I still believe that looking based on the order pace and based on the project list that we're seeing right now, but I do expect China to be weaker this year than last year and I believe the government is taking actions necessary to, again get their house in order and figure out how to keep that growth going and trying to continue to let air out of what I would call the bubble in certain sectors of the economy. But overall, I just got back from meeting with my Asia people and they're pretty still positive about China. But my assessment is even though they would think that they're doing as well as last year, I think they're doing a little bit worse than last year, but still okay, still positive growth, still at the growth rate. John Inch : Dave, a couple years ago I think you had called out a trend of Emerson pursuing more automation as part of your facilities in China. Where do you stand with respect to your operating footprint? Are you happy with the cost structure, where you're positioned there. Do you think there's a little more action you'd like to take just in light of the pending slightly softer outlook? David Farr : Still on path, John to continue to rationalize our manufacturing footprint in China and I would say that part of the actions we're taking in this acceleration will be to continue to do more of that. So the automation part is continuing to happen across the businesses. I think we pretty much got that done. But right now, what I'm going through is a rationalization of the manufacturing footprint and do we need that capacity or not need that capacity? But you also have to take into consideration the renminbi right now is continuing to devalue again and so we have to watch that. But we're continuing to rationalize that and I would say that the footprint is still declining. John Inch : Just lastly, the PTS gain, I think you said $520 million, I think previously we thought it was going to be about $1 billion. Was there something about the final closing that made that adjustment? Craig Rossman : Pretax number John, the 520 is an after-tax number. John Inch : Okay. So it was just pre versus post-tax. David Farr : $1 billion gain. Pretax gain. You had the right number. Operator : We'll go next to Scott Davis with Barclays. Scott Davis : Dave, you made some pretty cautious comments regarding the macro, I think for somewhat obvious reasons, but your guidance still implies some acceleration year-over-year. You just came off a pretty good quarter. What is it that you're seeing out there that's changed and maybe it's the month of January that's caused some concern, but if you back out currency your orders have been pretty good. Just give us a little bit of color on why you've been more cautious, despite the fact the 3% to 5% core growth, if you take the midpoint, would still be your best year in three years. David Farr : From my perspective Scott, the big issue right now would be what I'm seeing happening to our major oil and gas customers and they are definitely are starting to cut back and we're starting to see that. As you know we're very strong in that sector. We have good strength in North America and the North America guys are going to be cutting back with the price of oil where it is and the pressure point relative to the demand around the world. I have a pretty good understanding of the process industry. My gut tells me right now that we're going to see a deceleration of orders and sales in the process business that could cause us problems in the second half of this year and also 2016, hence the need for acceleration. I'm being very cautious because I am nervous about that. Scott Davis : How does -- I think upstream oil we all would -- I think most of us on the line here would agree is going to have some challenges. How does chemical play out as we get into the back half of the year and such? You're also very strong in that world as well and utility as well. David Farr : Yes, I think that there is a lot of puts and takes with the lower price of oil and gas as you well know, as you were just saying there. Upstream is clearly going to be hurt. National oil companies will keep spending, going in my opinion, around the world. Downstream with the lower feedstock going in both the oil and the gas, will be helped. The question is how fast do they go make those investments? The question is, I think it's going to be later maybe late 2015 on the calendar year basis, maybe early 2016 that we would see that type of acceleration. They have to go through the process. They have to think about the world and the rebalancing. They have to think about the world's demand. So I think there's going to be a lag to be honest, Scott. Based on what I've seen in the past when we've had this dramatic drop-off in the oil prices, you see a lag. I think there eventually will be a benefit and you're right, but I wouldn't be surprised if there is not a hole there for six or nine months or eight months for some of our businesses as the shift goes between downstream and upstream. We're strong in both bases. We're going to talk quite a bit about that, but clearly there is a hole opening up. No doubt about it. Hence, we're getting ready for it. Operator : And we'll go next to Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Just a question on the portfolio, you mentioned divestment sort of potentially underway in Commercial and Residential Solutions. It's sort of the fourth year now of maybe low, mid-single digit earnings growth. Does that make you want to accelerate portfolio change in divestments or does it make you want to kind of slow them down because you're not getting as much organic earnings growth as you may have expected a couple of years ago? David Farr : From my perspective, we laid out a plan of what we want to undertake in the restructuring a couple years ago and we have a couple pieces left and they are businesses that don't fit us strategically and we're going to get that done. One of them is we announced we're evaluating Intermetro right now and we will continue to look at acquisitions and when they come up and I think they will come up in this marketplace that potentially could get a little sloppy in late 2015, early 2016 from an acquisition. We're clearly looking for acquisitions, but we're also not going to go crazy. I understand that divesting has an impact on the company, but I'm also repositioning this company for the future. Sometimes transition takes time. The company's extremely healthy right now through this transition. We're investing. The quality of the earnings, the quality of the assets are very high. I expect my shareholders to stay with us as we make this reposition and then we will continue to figure out how to accelerate our top line growth and earnings growth coming out of this. We know what it takes to grow this company. Julian Mitchell : And then just on the currency hit to earnings, wonder if you could quantify that at all for this year or say what the hit was in Q1 to earnings from currency? David Farr : So from the perspective of the way we look at currency, as we look at the way we're balanced around the world, both the inputs and outputs. If we lose $1 of sales, we lose about $0.15 of profits, 15%, and so if we lost 3 points of growth in the first quarter, you can calculate that and you can then calculate what that means on average, we lose about $0.15, $0.16 with the current structure and the current currency makeup. So can tell you how much earnings we lost in the first quarter. Those things help us sometimes and hurt us sometimes and I'm a big believer in a strong dollar. Right now obviously, it's hurting us, but I'm a big believer in a strong dollar and our objective is to figure out how to grow this company and deal with the fact that we have a headwind, but who cares, we've got a headwind.  So from my perspective, we're going to deal with it. And so the same thing happens through the year. We just lost, as you know, we're going to lose probably 4 to 5 points of currency growth for the year. You can do the same calculation what that means in EPS. Julian Mitchell : Very quickly, just a clarification on the -- you made some comments on pricing. Your gross margins have obviously been very, very strong Q1 and last fiscal year. Do you see any potential for that gross margin increase to kind of plateau out because pricing may get tougher? David Farr : From our perspective right now, the comment I made is we look at the price cost and we're green. With the movement of commodities where they are right now, it's going to help us in the next couple quarters. I know that we will have pricing actions necessary over time and typically, what happens, pricing will catch up and so we'll lose some of that green. But at this point in time, our ability to manage the price cost and stay slightly green or within that around zero has been very good and I don't see that changing here in the next couple years. Stability will come in commodities and we'll probably have to give some price back, but that pressure probably won't build into 2016, but I still believe that we can maintain our green capability. We have the infrastructure and management team to be able to do that. So we clearly are mapping it out right now and we have a benefit going, but I also know that benefit will come against me at some point in time, too. Operator : We'll go next to Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan: Dave, you talk about increasing the restructuring, but you've also had the foot on the gas with some of these growth investments that you've been increasing recently. What happens to those in this sort of changed environment? Do you keep speeding on those or pull back on a few? Maybe a little color there. David Farr : From our perspective, we're going through a quick evaluation of some of those growth investments based on the segments, based on what we see happening here in the next couple years. I would say there is going to be a fine tuning, but we're going to continue to invest and protect the key growth investments to drive that growth and re-evaluate our cost structure elsewhere and so we're going to do a balancing act here. Clearly, one of the things we're going to look at is if we have a segment that's under a lot of pressure and downward trend line for the next couple years, we may pull back on that from a growth investment standpoint and not spend that money. But we're going to keep most of it going forward and rebalance cost structure elsewhere. Shannon O'Callaghan: All right. In process, we've got kind of the end market look, upstream, downstream. As you look across the different product lines, the valves, devices, systems, is there any difference you expect or you're already seeing or that you expect to see in terms of what parts of that are going to hold up better than others? David Farr : It's a little bit hard to tell right now. All I can tell you is, someone asked me the first question about why we have insight been in the business quite a bit. We have some segments in the process world that lead this change when the cycle changes and they've been changing now for 60 days and they've been changing the wrong way, down. So I think that the early cycle parts are already starting to impact and we're seeing that and we're going to redirect our organization to figure out how to make sure we protect our MRO business, how to protect the small brownfield investments and I think that it's hard to say which one's going to do worse. All I can tell you right now is the leading places within the process world have already started turning and directly tell us that we're going to have a slowdown. It's coming. Operator : We'll go next to Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Josh Pokrzywinski : I guess first question on the backlog, how much visibility do you think you have? And then I guess in conversations with your customers, I think to follow-up on the question from last quarter, how long before they start thinking about cancellations in addition to incoming order weakness? David Farr : Right now, the backlog is holding. As you know, we reprice our backlog every month with the currency and so when you see our orders turn down, a lot of times when the currency impacts those orders down and up and so right now, we're repricing, but the backlog's sitting at higher levels than it was this year last time. Right now, it's at $6.8 billion and so we have not seen any pushback on the backlog. I think what's going to happen is you're going to see a push out in maybe some of the execution of them. If the project's been awarded and they're procuring materials, there is a lot of cancellation impact there. I think you're going to see a rebalancing from a customer perspective. What's going on right now is they're evaluating where they want to spend their money which projects they want to go forward which projects they want to slow down which projects they only want to do half of. This is going to take time, but it's pretty clear to me, based on the grinding we're seeing at the customer level and the feedback we're getting and also the early indications that there is going to be a slowdown and a push out. As I said earlier, there is going to be some holes emerging in the process order and sales book and our objective is to figure out how to gain penetration around the world to try to protect our growth. But I know it's going to slow down and be slower and we're going to have some quarters that potentially go negative in the process world. So it's pretty clear what's happening. It will take about six months to unfold and our customer base is clearly working it right now. Most importantly for us is we're getting ready. We're redirecting our organization around the world where we think we need to go to make sure we can maximize our growth potential in the marketplace. Josh Pokrzywinski : To think about the magnitude of that, I understand it's early, there's a lot of balls up in the air, still not all determined yet, but presumably in your career, you've seen big CapEx downturns by some of your larger customers. Do you find yourself moving at a fraction of that or a multiple of that or kind of on a one to one basis? If you had an E&P CapEx by 20%, do you guys feel it dollar for dollar or maybe less so? David Farr : It's not dollar for dollar. We're going to take you through, I've asked Steve Sonnenberg to take you through the mix of our business in February, how it mixes out, how we see if capital spending goes down in oil by 15%, what does that mean to us relative to -- we'll go through the details and calculations for you on that. But it's not dollar per dollar. Our current indication right now, based on inputs, is we're going to see the marketplace globally, the market globally is going to be negative. I think in the process world for the next 12 months. What we've been able to do historically, is we've been able to outperform the market, but we clearly see with the take back, the cut down of certain spending that the marketplace, what we call the process world is definitely going to go negative. The game plan for us right now is how to have growth in a marketplace that's going to be negative for 12 or 18 months coming at us here in the very near future. That's the game plan. Josh Pokrzywinski : If I could sneak in a non-oil question which I'm sure you're longing for. David Farr : I like oil. I love oil. Josh Pokrzywinski : I'll sell some to you at a discount. On the HVAC business, I guess the climate side, related in IA, are you guys able to quantify what the benefit was from pre-buy and how we should think about that versus 2Q and 3Q? David Farr : The market has talked about 1 million units being pulled up. 1 million units. I can't remember off the top of my head, but it's pretty significant. I couldn't tell you, if you go out I'm sure it's out there, they can tell you who it is and you can go out and find out how many units are out there. One million units were pulled up and clearly that is not for one quarter. That's a pull ahead, they have 18 months to use that buildup. So the way I look at it right now as we put in the press release, we won't get a feel for this until March, April, what units are being sold and what other type of market dynamics we have out there. We're going to see pretty sloppy North America order pace for climate for the next three, four months. I'm of the opinion that it is going to bounce back and we're going to see a recovery there and we'll get back to some normality. Clearly, that inventory build is not for one quarter. It was meant to be for 18 months and we'll see what happens there. Operator : We'll go next to Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : On slide 3, I may have missed this, the favorable currency transaction at $19 million, was that a year-over-year or was that a comp? What was the factor there? Craig Rossman : Yes, so that's the year-over-year. Deane Dray : Was the impact a year ago? What would have been -- I'm not used to seeing anything currency being favorable in this environment. David Farr : This is a cost -- this is different type of -- Craig Rossman : In transactional currency, we have the number of contracts, long-term contracts mainly in process that get marked to market for currency. Given that they're heavily into some currencies that are depreciating where we have strong currency contracts, those get marked to market. It's called embedded derivatives. We had a big pickup there in embedded derivatives in the quarter and you're right, it is unusual to see it go in that direction. David Farr : What will happen is that will zero out over a time period, typically within 12, 18 months it will zero out. One quarter, you'll get it. Next quarter, you lose it. It will zero out. That's why say flag it, so you see it because we know we're not going to keep that forever. Deane Dray : Now, in the comment on slide 5 regarding higher working capital needs, so with the expectation of some of the softening maybe you can just point to which business specifically you'd see the higher working capital. David Farr : That was for the quarter because we had underlying growth of 6% and so one of the things we saw was a little bit of higher working capital. As our underlying growth comes down, we'll start taking capital off the balance sheet. So that's not unusual for us to go up and down in a quarter, but that's what he's referring to. He's referring to higher underlying growth rate in the first quarter. That 6% level we actually built a little bit of working capital typically. Even though we had good conversion, it still went up dollar-wise and hurt us in the quarter, that's all it was. Deane Dray : Just last question, I don't want to front run too much of your Analyst Day. David Farr : I'm working on that, I'm really starting to get it fine-tuned here. I don't want to give all the facts to you, yet. Deane Dray : Not looking for facts, but just in terms of thematically, it sounds like you'll give us more color on the oil exposure. Is there anything else thematically you might be touching on? David Farr : I think we\u2019re going to break up in the process side. We're going to try to figure out if as I said, the market's going to be negative for a period here for 12 or 18 months, how we're going to grow and we're going to talk a little about that. It'll be a big issue there. We'll get into a little bit -- I've asked Ed Monser to talk about international. I think there's going to be a period here now with the currencies reshuffling out there. You see a lot of currencies, international currencies, devaluing and there is going to be a changing mix right now relative to what's competitive out there in the marketplace and you're going to start moving production around the world. We're going to talk a little about that and how we're positioned and where you see the pockets of growth. I think we're going to give you a little bit of insight there. And then I'm going to have Charlie talk a little about Internet of Things and where we continue to invest to change our business models that will evolve over time. In this industry, it's a very slow process, but we're going to have Charlie talk about that. We've got some fun things to talk about. We're making investments. We're going to figure out how to grow this company. We've got some good things to talk about. Operator : We'll go next to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : So just back to process, I think someone, perhaps Shannon, was trying to get at this a little bit, but I'm just trying to understand kind of the mix effects in the business. And in particular I believe, although I'm not 100% correct, that kind of the strength in North America oil and gas has been very, very mix positive for you. Maybe in general, things have been mix positive because the big projects have kind of been looming but not really kicking into gear. Is that right? Should we be thinking about a kind of meaningful mix down as we roll forward here the next, I don't know 3, 4, 5 quarters? David Farr : You're exactly right. We're very strong in North America, we're very strong in oil and gas and we've had a good run in North America. Our North America percent of sales for process has gone up the last couple years because of the oil and gas investments. Clearly, one of the things we're dealing with right now on restructuring and the process guys will be restructuring is how to protect our profitability with the changing mix. Steve's going to go through that with you relative to what we see happening. But clearly, things are going to go on in North America on a negative side, but also things on the positive side. If we have less oil and gas investment in North America, we think, at the appropriate time, you're going to see improvement in downstream investments which are also very good for us in North America. The problem is not going to be synced up properly. You're going to see a slowdown in the oil and gas upfront. We're not going to see a pickup in the downstream later on. We have to figure out how to get our cost structure in-line, protect our profitability and process with the changing mix. That is, hence, one of the aggressiveness we're trying to take right now from a restructuring standpoint because we've had a benefit in this the last couple years. You're exactly right. Jeff Sprague : That strength you saw in Latin America and Canada, is that all oil patch related too or is there a little bit of diversity in that strength? David Farr : In Canada, it's primarily oil and gas. The key issue for us is, I think Canada's not going to back off as much as people think on spending in protecting their oil and gas. They need that income. I think we had a very good quarter. I still think it will weaken but I don't think -- we'll see how much those oil companies protect Canada up there. Right now, we're still expecting Canada to have some growth this year. We had a very good Mexico and the investments have continued in Mexico, primarily not in the oil and gas, but other areas of Mexico and the wild card for us does Mexico hold up for us in 2015? But we had a he very good start in Latin America and that's helped us quite a bit. I think people are probably surprised at how good our process business was in the first quarter and our backlog, by the way, did not really drop in process in the first quarter. So we shift what we knew business. We had a very good first quarter. Jeff Sprague : Just one quick one, if I could. On climate, the margins are not as high as I would have guessed given the volume surge. Did that pre-buy or prebuild cause you a lot of inefficiencies in overtime and the like? Any color there? David Farr : No, it didn't cause us a problem there. The issue is just a mix business within the type of pre-buy, the type of product that our customers were buying would be at the lower end of our mix and so, therefore we didn't get as much flow-through in the profitability. We still made decent money because we did get some profit improvement, but you're right it was not what I would call in the sweet spot of our compressor type of business. Operator : And we'll go next to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Dave, so the $50 million serve up in restructuring, it sounds like process is going to account for the bulk of that. Is that the right way to think about it? David Farr : No, we're going across the whole company. I'm particularly looking at Europe which will mean I might be hitting network power. I'm going to be hitting industrial automation, I'm going to be hitting process. I'm going to be looking at -- I'm a little bit nervous about Europe. I think Europe had some fundamental cost issues. I don't think those governments are really dealing with it. Devaluing the currency is not going to help them as much in a real cost structure standpoint. They have a lot of inefficiencies there. The fact they're not getting growth is a concern for me. So you're going to see us take some across the board, but it's going to be across all businesses, process and network power will be the two biggest and industrial automation will be the third. Nigel Coe : Which leads on to [inaudible] power because if we adjust the prior year for [inaudible], then margins are still down year-over-year. I'm wondering obviously your restructuring, additional restructuring will help in the back half of the year, but what is your line of sight in terms of mix or other factors to drive margins back into expansion? David Farr : There are two issues. There is restructuring from the cost standpoint. We have the new products out. We're selling the new products. The key issue for me right now is continuing to right-size and readjust that organization for the new business model, the new marketplace and that will continue to happen throughout this year and then continue to work on the cost structure of the new products and the new organization relative to deliver that business. So we're going through a process right now. We're going to have to sort of rebase that whole business. We've got the ability. We've got the products. The question is how do we change that cost structure to get the levels of profitability and I want -- Scott Barber's going to talk about that in New York. That's the key issue for me going forward is we know where this marketplace has gone, we have the capability for dealing with it now, how do we make acceptable profitability? Nigel Coe : A quick one, Dave on Russia. Sounds like Russia was still up for you in process which is remarkable given all the news flow in Russia. Is that correct? Maybe just a bit of color in terms of what you're seeing over there. David Farr : Russia was still good for us. Now, we got hit pretty hard with the ruble. But we have a very strong local manufacturing capability and service capability in Russia and given the fact that we have this local capability, it's given us a pretty good competitive advantage. So we're seeing the company still spending money and so our business in Russia has held up and we had a decent quarter. The question, will that continue to be able to do that from the standpoint of where can they come up with the money? But right now, we had a very good start to the year and we see our customers' spending money. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Wood with Macquarie. Mike Wood : Given how many questions we're getting from investors on process, can you just give us a sense of what declines you're expecting particularly in the upstream business and how you're thinking about it from a sensitivity standpoint versus even periods like 2009 when you saw pretty significant declines in that business? David Farr : I would rather wait on the 19th to talk about that. I think you're going to -- I'll give you an idea. Right now, we're looking at the market declines because of what we see out there probably in the 2% to 3% range, overall total process market declines about 2% to 3% which is a little bit less than the last one with the shifting going on relative to some of the downstream investments and other investments going on around the world. That's where we see. We'll talk more about that. But overall, the oil and gas number obviously is going to be a lot bigger decline and we'll talk about that, but I think the market overall is going to be down 2%, 3%. Mike Wood : I'll wait to hear more on that, then. Just regards to your balance sheet, how are you thinking about where your leverage is now? Why not take a more aggressive balance sheet stance through buybacks or more aggressive, larger M&A given just the share performance over the past few years? David Farr : Clearly, not happy about the share performance in the last couple of years. From my perspective right now, we're going to buy back at a minimum, $2 billion worth of stock this year. We're also trying to keep our balance sheet ready if the right opportunity comes along from an acquisition standpoint, but we have not seen that opportunity at this point in time that makes sense to create value. We're keeping that balance sheet and if necessary we'll continue to increase share repurchase at the right -- appropriate time. But I don't see us changing the leverage on our company at this point, because I would like to make sure that we have the ability to do a significant acquisition if the right one comes along. Mike Wood : And then just finally, can you give us any more color on the Intermetro size of the business? David Farr : It's a little too early to talk about that, but it's more than $200 million. Operator : We'll go next to Mark Douglass with Longbow Research. Mark Douglass : Dave, can you talk about some more of the challenges in China? For you, are they more general economy specific to certain market exposures? Frankly which segment has the most China exposure? David Farr : We're pretty strong in China on all segments but clearly process, network power, climate and then industrial. Network Power is number one, then Process is number two, Climate's number three and Industrial's number four, off the top of my head. I think it's market. There is a general slowdown as they look at where they want investments to happen. We had a very good period last year across the board and I think right now, what we're seeing at the highest level in China is sort of re-evaluation of where money's going to be spent and how they're going to fund it. So what we're expecting is a step back up as you get into the springtime in China and so we'll get a better feel. Right now, we're still pretty optimistic based on the type of transaction and bidding going on that we're going to see growth this year, but albeit I think it will be a little lesser growth. It's all about where money's being spent and not being spent right now. That's what it is. Mark Douglass : Okay. And then on Network Power, the big project in Sweden, how much did it help you in the quarter? Is there still some leftover, still over into say the second quarter? Does this imply maybe that Network Power is flat to even maybe down underlying by the time we get to the back half of the year? David Farr : The product is going to spread out over the year. Actually, some of the project might go into next year. I think from our perspective, the project's spread out and the key issue for us is we've got the capability to win. The question is how do we change that cost structure to win the type in the marketplace we see today. That's what Scott Barber and his team is all focused on at this point in time. We know how to sell. We know how to make money. The question is how to make acceptable levels of profitability. That's why we have them take a hard look at the restructuring. Given the products, given what we need, let's deal with this issue now and get on with it. Operator : We'll go next to Steve Winoker with Stanford Bernstein. Steve Winoker : Listen, on the slide 11 when you talked about guidance, you talked about modest profitability improvement. We've talked around that a lot. But just the puts and takes, if restructuring sounds like $100 million or call it 180 basis points, I've got FX which sounded like you said 15%, so $25 million or $30 million. I've got price versus commodity which sounds still positive and then productivity and then you've got normal incremental leverage on the volume which is something like $67 million or so. So I'm just trying to understand what am I missing or how are you guys thinking about the puts and takes? Frankly, what I really want to know is just what is the modest profitability improvement you're look for all-in, net? David Farr : 1/10th, 2/10th [ph], that will be the chart. With the puts and takes we've got going on right now, we're going to be fighting for profitability and that's the game plan. Steve Winoker : Okay. And then secondly on restructuring, Dave, Emerson has done an extraordinary amount of restructuring and cost takeout for certainly, both before the downturn and through the downturn, up until now. I'm as big a believer in lean and benefits of cost takeout -- it never stops. That being said, it's a pretty decent size number we're looking at this year. How do you sort of think about muscle versus fat on this one and protecting the growth? David Farr : Any company as large as Emerson, you do acquisitions, you make investments, you can get a little less lean. We're going after this pretty hard. We're looking at of all the capital investments we make in the last couple years, sort of which ones can we get more out of it productivity-wise? We're not going to cut anything that's crucial to growing this company, but we have ability to lean this company out and I fundamentally believe we could be facing extended time period where I want to lean it. We're going to lean it. You're right, we know how to do that. The business leaders have done a great job of reacting to this. I came back from a trip to India in the middle of January and I met with the OC. I said, we need to lean out. That's what we're doing. So Ed Purvis takes over and it's all he's talking about right now is figuring out how to lean this thing out, working with Frank and other guys. We're not going to damage ourself. Always room to get better. Always room to get leaner and meaner just like you are, Steve. Steve Winoker : One more thing, you talked about downstream chemical opportunity. And I understand the feedstock point, but the spread between oil and gas matters a lot with regard to ethylene and ethylene linking to butadiene, propylene, benzene, et cetera. What are you guys seeing? You're not concerned about the shrinking gap between oil and gas inputs potentially putting new investments on hold? David Farr : We haven't seen any of that, yet, but that's obviously clear. It's clearly a key issue. I think that's why there is going to be a pause here where people evaluate where everything's going to stabilize, that's why a gap's going to open up. It's pretty easy to put things on hold on upstream. I think they're going to take a little longer to evaluate downstream. We do know some of the gas liquification and those type of materials are going to move forward and things like that at this point in time. Clearly, there is a lot of evaluation going on and I'm very concerned about it, that's why Steve Sonnenberg and his team are going to be pretty aggressive here to rebalance their cost structure knowing they could be facing an 18 month headwind. So you're right, Steve, we don't know exactly yet, but we do know that it's going to be tougher and we do know there's still going to be huge capital out there being spent. How do we get more of that capital? How do we use our people to get more of that capital? Operator : We'll go next to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. David Farr : Hello, Mr. Tusa. If there's a million unit pull up, what's the total number? You know the total, what is it? Steve Tusa : For what? David Farr : If you had a million unit pull up in the quarter, what's the total industry in a year? Steve Tusa : Five and change. David Farr : Six, yes. Steve Tusa : So just on oil and gas, you're talking about a market, you said being down in the 2% to 3% range, is that a 2016 comment? David Farr : The total process marketplace, I think we're going to have a window here of the 12 months going to be down 2% to 3%. Steve Tusa : Over the course of calendar 2015? David Farr : Correct. Steve Tusa : You sound pretty negative, rightfully so. There is a lot of cross-currents going on out here, but 2% to 3% doesn't really sound that bad. Is there a quarter or two here that could get pretty ugly and how should we be prepared for the coming string of orders reports here? Should we be kind of prepped for a couple double-digiters in there for you guys or what's the story on that front? David Farr : Based on history, Steve, there is definitely going to be two quarters that are going to be tough. Is our next quarter going to be one of them? It's hard for me to tell right now from the reaction around the world. But clearly, we're going to have a couple tough quarters here from an orders standpoint; second, third quarter or third and fourth quarter and I think leading into early next year. So there is no doubt about it, there is going to be a transition here and the question is how fast we see that transition which markets hold up which industries hold up. But clearly you're exactly right, you're going to see a couple tough quarters and I don't know which ones they are. They're coming. Steve Tusa : Will you guys be negative, do you think on your core? I would assume, if it's going to happen, it'll happen in the second half and into the first half of next year. Do you see a quarter where you're negative? I would think that if it is negative, it's not going to be more than a negative mid-single digit type of number. Is that the right way to think about it? David Farr : You talking process or total, Steve? Steve Tusa : Process. David Farr : Yes. I think we do not see that yet, but you're exactly right. I would say you could have a negative 5%, 8%, 6%, 7% quarter, yes. Steve Tusa : This year? David Farr : Maybe not this year. My gut tells me if I was going to put a gut call right now, based on my knowledge of the industry, it's first quarter of FY \u201816 which is the fourth calendar quarter. Steve Tusa : Okay. So we can kind of do the linearity on where the 6% you did this quarter and then kind of march it down from there and then maybe march it back up, depending on what our view is on what our call is on where it's going to be? David Farr : I think yes. I wish I was that good. If I was, I would [inaudible] right now, as would you be, too. But you're exactly right, that's what's going to happen. It's going to march down and march back up. The question is how big does that hole get and right now I know it's coming. Steve Tusa : The key is pretending to be that good, I think. David Farr : You telling me I'm pretending to be good? Is that what you're saying? Steve Tusa : I'm saying for the rest of us. David Farr : Okay. Steve Tusa : On the rest of the business, the orders for Climate, some parts of Industrial Automation, I mean, I can't imagine that over the next quarter those are going to look that great either because of the pre-buy impact and then obviously industrial automation you have some oil and gas exposure and then on Network Power you've got the comp to Facebook. Again, I think getting out in front of these orders numbers, I mean, am I missing anything on that front or is the next couple months kind of for the company in total going to be pretty tough too from orders perspective? David Farr : I wouldn't be a shocked CEO if we don't have a negative second quarter order quarter. I wouldn't be shocked. These things happen. I have a little sign here, I can't swear but blank happens. That's why we're being pretty aggressive right now, looking at the restructuring because we know it's going to happen and the question if it's not the second quarter, it will be the third quarter. Clearly, you're going to have a downdraft here and we have a good backlog and we've had good order pace, but clearly, we're going to have a downdraft. I think the U.S. is going to have a downdraft. Steve Tusa : One last question on -- you talked about the company in transition. It doesn't sound like there is any -- these divestitures are chunks of the business, not necessarily a big kind of strategic split or anything like that. And then you talked about doing acquisitions, but you said you're kind of holding your fire power for a bigger one. On either front, should we expect something major like a $5 billion-plus type of thing on either side, the divestiture or deal front? David Farr : Right now, there is nothing of that substance, however clearly, I evaluate the businesses at all point in time. If I feel like a business cannot fundamentally get back to the performance that it needs to get to and we've talked about this, Network Power is one of them that would be a strategic repositioning. However, I also said that we were going to play this out over three years. We're 18 months into that, almost, not quite 18. But so right now, that clearly is a business if I'm not able to deliver value for my shareholders, I will figure out how to get out of that business and create value another way. Steve Tusa : That's not something you're going to do at the Investor Day. That's not at the Investor Day. David Farr : Yes, no. We're not talking about something big like that, no. Operator : We'll go next to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : So just staying on process for a second, Dave, I appreciate all the -- David Farr : Go figure, process. Joe Ritchie : What's that? David Farr : I said go figure, something on process. Joe Ritchie : Exactly. But I do appreciate all the color you've given us. The question I have is really around the resiliency of your margins in Process. Last cycle, you saw your EBIT decline about close to 20% in the business and Process is a lot bigger today than it was back then and so just trying to get a sense for how you guys are thinking about your cost structure when this downturn actually happens? David Farr : The big issue will be is we clearly are going to try to figure out how to get ahead of our cost structure, how we're going to cut back where we need to cut back, but we will not damage the business. So historically, if I have a couple quarters of down sales for Process, we will obviously take a cost action to minimize that down profit, but we will not -- this is a very strong value creator for the company. So we could have a couple quarters like we've had in the past where the margins deteriorate, but I also put pressure on the organization to make sure that we maximize and not waste our investment. So if we do have a couple tough quarters, most likely late this year and going into early 2016, I would say you're going to see a margin deterioration and what we're trying do right now is get ahead of that to minimize that margin deterioration without damaging the core company. Joe Ritchie : Is there an opportunity for your -- given you've got a larger installed base, is there an opportunity for MRO investment to help soften some of the blow? David Farr : We'll talk about that. If you look at how many billions of dollars of equipment we shipped the last five or six years, our install base has grown dramatically. So the answer is yes. However, it's always about timing and what comes on and comes off, but you're exactly right, our installed base is much larger. As you well know, part of our investment the last three years has been building out stronger and stronger global service organization. So we actually have the assets in place to take advantage of this, but the question will be is can you execute on that to offset the other areas? That's our game plan. I'm not going in and allowing my Process guys right now say they can drop their margins, that's not the game. We're figuring out how do you hold your margins, but I also will not damage that company if I see a sudden drop-off. I will not do stupid things for that business because it is really a strong value creator for Emerson. We have the right position to protect profitability, it's just a matter of can we execute? Operator : We'll go next to Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : Just a question on oil and gas exposure in Industrial Automation and specifically, beyond the breakout, how much of the cat exposure do you think is related to oil and gas? David Farr : I don't want to give you a rough number off the top of my head, but it is a significant number and you've already seen the bookings get impacted by that the last couple months. If you looked at our alternator businesses, the orders have dropped off. I'll give you an exact number, Craig. If I had to take a wild guess, I wouldn't say a wild guess, but a guess, I would estimate, I would say it's around a quarter. Andrew Obin : A quarter of the [inaudible]? David Farr : Yes and we're starting to see it already and we'll talk about that, but they react pretty quickly because those are long lead time-type of products. Andrew Obin : Just to clarify, it's the quarter of the cat exposure or the quarter of the industrial automation business? Sorry about that. David Farr : I would say a quarter of the industrial automation. The business would be tied to oil and gas total. Andrew Obin : Just a question on capital allocation, it seems that other companies that are active in capital allocation are bringing up the fact that private equity is capped in terms of the leverage they can take on for deals these days. How does it change your thinking on, A, sort of making acquisitions because it seems both [inaudible], I think, stated that there's just more opportunity now. But B, also given that private equity is capped, how does it change your view on divesting businesses, if you could talk about that? David Farr : We got a very good price for our power transmission. I think it was a good deal for both of us [inaudible] and I think we got a good price. We laid out what we wanted to divest. Right now, we know what those do businesses are and I don't think it's changed from the standpoint of what we're looking at right now. We try to find strategic buyers and we'll continue to work that, but I don't think it's changing anything. It's just the amount of assets out there right now. There is not a lot of assets to buy and there's not a lot of assets being sold either. That's why we had a lot of interest in the power transmission business when we sold it. Operator : We'll go next to Jeremie Capron with CLSA. Jeremie Capron : David, it sounds like you have pretty high confidence in your ability to grow 3% to 5% ex-currency this year, despite this weaker outlook globally and I appreciate you've had a good start in Q1. We've got a solid backlog, but after all that's been said on the call today, particularly on the Process side of things, where do we get the growth from? Which segments of the company are you seeing are taking us to that 4% to 5% for the remainder of the year? David Farr : Our largest market's still North America and we still have a very strong business in North America across a lot of Emerson. That business is right now is holding up. We have not seen any deterioration in North America. I still see very good growth for us in Mexico. I see very good growth for us in India. From perspective of China, we're expecting growth. I have markets around the world that are still growing. There will be a lot less growth than originally thought, but I still believe that we can still have that underlying type of growth we're talking about with the mix of businesses that we have and the strong business presence we have in North America. So that's where I come from at this point in time. If I start seeing North America weakening from an economic standpoint, then obviously that will change because that will hurt us, given our strong presence we have here in North America. Jeremie Capron : Okay. Maybe finally, going back to the balance sheet, in this environment of slow growth and cheap debt, what do you think is the optimal capital structure for Emerson? I understand the discussion around potentially going after bigger acquisitions etcetera, but outside of this, what do you think about capital structure? David Farr : We have a very flexible capital structure. Right now, we're running around the mid-30% debt to capital right now. We've taken it down as low as the mid-20%s. I think right now the mid-30%s is an area a that gives us the flexibility we need to deal with and we can flex down quite easily. So I think from our capital structure right now, I think it's a decent capital structure and gives us the room we need. At the same time, it's given us -- we're sending a lot of money back to our shareholders. In the last four years, we've almost sent back $10 billion to our shareholders. So we're very shareholder friendly and we'll continue to spend money back for our shareholders if necessary and use our capital structure appropriately. So we try to keep it flexible. I think at the same time, we're paying money back to our shareholders. This year, we'll give to our shareholders over $3 billion. I'll say that over $3 billion to our shareholders this year. Last year, we gave them over $2 billion. Year before that, we gave them over $2 billion. So we pay back to our shareholders. Operator : We'll go next to Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Rich Kwas : Process, the 2% to 3% down for the industry, does that assume any offsets in other areas of process? Because if you talk to some of the industry consultants, they say oil and gas is 20% of the market and there is growth in other areas because of lower energy prices. Chemicals, obviously, is one. But does that assume just -- does that take into account you're overweight on oil and gas? Is that referencing that? Or are you just looking at how you define process and coming up with that? David Farr : We define the process. We'll show you when Steve's talking about how we go at this. Clearly, it means a much stronger down oil and gas spend number and you're exactly right, there's offsets that minimize that. Overall we still believe, probably the next 12 months, the total process marketplace as we see it today will be negative driven primarily because the oil and gas clearly drop off, coming off very high levels. Still a lot of money being spent and the key issue for us is how do we get more than our fair share of that money being spent? That's where my focus is for all my team. How do you get more of that spending dollars, even though it's shrinking out there how do you go get some more of it? That's the whole market and I think that is waiting it out. That's just today. Rich Kwas : Right. On the downstream piece, do you think you'll see orders late in the calendar year early? Late in calendar year 2015, early 2016? How soon does that translate? It would seem like there is some lag there. David Farr : I think there is a hole opening up. My gut tells me we will be late, late calendar year 2015, maybe the last quarter and more like the first half of 2016 calendar year. Rich Kwas : Right, but it takes some time for that to turn into revenue right? David Farr : Correct. The key thing for us right now, as someone mentioned earlier, is we have a very strong MRO business. How do we take advantage of our installed base that we've dramatically grown the last -- if you look at the last 10 years of our capital, our money we've sold in this industry, how do we take advantage of that? That's going to be the key focus point for us because you're going to have a window here where you lose -- the projects aren't going to happen for you, you're going to have to go out and get that business day in and day out. David Farr : I want to thank everybody for the call. I appreciate it. I look forward to seeing you guys in a couple weeks in New York City. Hopefully, the snow, and we won't have snow again, whatever that thing was called. The mayor called it, was going to be the worst snowstorm ever in New York and I must have missed that one. But look forward to seeing everybody and hopefully everyone stays healthy. Take care now. Bye. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

During today\u2019s presentation by Emerson management all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. This conference is being recorded today, May 5, 2015. Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Craig Rossman, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead. Craig Rossman : Thank you, Robert. This afternoon, I am joined by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's second quarter 2015 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on the Emerson's website at Emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next 90 days. I will start with the highlights of the quarter, as shown on slide two of the presentation. Net sales in the quarter decreased 7% to $5.4 billion with underlying sales flat. As a result of lower oil prices, capital spending reductions by global customers in oil and gas markets, particularly upstream were faster and more significant than expected. A broad slowdown in industrial spending, particularly in North America and China, and most pronounced in energy-related markets affected order rates and resulting sales in the quarter. The strength of the U.S. dollar continues to be a significant headwind. Order rates reflected economic conditions -- difficult economic conditions in the quarter beyond oil and gas, continued weakness in European short cycle spending impacted demand. However Europe is beginning to show signs of movement, benefiting from the depreciation of the euro. We expect European competitors to continue to use the weaker euro to their advantage. Global Telecommunications customers continue to expect capital spending across all geographies and Climate Technologies order rates were affected by the U.S. residential air conditioning pre-built in the previous two quarters. Turning to slide three, gross profit margin declined 110 basis points to 40.1%, driven by volume deleverage resulting from the sudden drop to flat underlying sales growth after two quarters of moderate growth. Specifically in the U.S. which turned negative after two quarters of 8% underlying sales growth. Gross profit margins also reflecting unfavorable business mix and higher costs related to increased strategic investment in 2014. Reported earnings per share increased 84% to a $1.42. Adjusted earnings per share decreased 16% to $0.65, excluding a $0.77 gain on the sale of the Power Transmission Solutions business. Current markets conditions will acquire more focused on the execution of strategic programs. Turning to slide four, for the second quarter P&L summary, as mentioned, net sales decreased 7% versus the prior year, while gross profit margin was down 110 basis points. Included in the results was the $932 million gain on the sale of the Power Transition Solutions business and restructuring spend of $44 million, 15 million shares were repurchased during the quarter. Turning to slide five, underlying sales growth in the quarter was flat, excluding unfavorable currency translation of 5% and an impact from divestiture of 2%. By geography, demand was mix with the Middle East and Africa up 8%, Europe up 2%, Asia up 1%, while the U.S. was down 3% and Latin America was down 7%. Turning to slide six, business segment margins declined to 260 basis points to 13.2%, primarily due to volume deleverage and unfavorable mix. Operating cash flow decreased due to a lower operating results and investment in working capital. Operating cash flow will take a couple of quarters to recover. Trade working capital performance was also affected by the business slowdown. Turn to slide seven for the Process Management segment results. Process Management underlying sales grew by 2% with a 5% reduction from currency translation, resulting in net sales decreased of 3% in the quarter. Upstream oil and gas activity slowed as the results of industry capital budget reductions, while downstream activity continued to be a bright spot, particularly in the power and chemical and petrochemical markets. Demand in Asia was up 6% with strong growth in India and other emerging markets offsetting a slight decline in China, while Europe was up 7% with double-digit growth in emerging markets. Similarly Africa was up 3%, reflecting favorable activity levels across the region. Margins were down 350 basis points due to unfavorable mix, the impact of the stronger dollar on operations, higher levels of invested spending and increased restructuring. Demand is expected to remain weak for the next 12 months. Turn to slide eight for the Industrial Automation segment results. Industrial Automation net sales decreased 16% as currency translation deducted 6% and divestitures deducted 8%, resulting in an underlying sales decline of 2% versus the prior year. Second quarter results were affected by weakness in short cycle European demand, upstream oil and gas, and industrial spending in energy-related markets. Geographic demand was mixed with North America down 1%, Europe down 2% and Asia up 1%. Reduction in upstream oil and gas spending continue to negatively affect order rates in the Power Generating Alternators and Electrical Distribution businesses. Margin decreased to 130 basis points, reflecting volume deleverage, unfavorable mix and a 40 basis point impact from divestitures. We expect market conditions to remain mix with some improvement in Europe and continued weakness in energy-related markets. Turn to slide nine for the Network Power segment results. Network Power sales decreased 9% as currency translation deducted 5% and divestitures deducted 1%, resulting in an underlying sale declined of 3% versus the prior year. Demand for global -- decreased global demand for Telecommunications Power business continued, while the Data Center business decreased moderately reflecting continued weakness in infrastructure investment. Geographic results varied with Europe up 4%, benefiting from hyper-scale data centre project revenues in Sweden, while North America was down 7% and Asia was down 5%. Margins decreased reflecting volume deleverage, unfavorable mix and increased restructuring. In the second half of the year we expect improving data center market conditions with continued weakness in Telecommunications Power spending. Turn to slide 10 for the Climate Technologies segment results. Climate Technologies net sales decreased 6% as U.S. air conditioning customers work through pre-built inventory from the previous two quarters. Underlying sales declined 3% as currency translation deducted 3%. Asia was down 2% as growth in India, Australia, and Southeast Asia air conditioning and refrigeration businesses was more than offset by slowing demand in China. In other regions, Europe had slight growth of 1%, Middle East and Africa was up 35%, and Latin America was down 19%. Modest underlying growth in the second half of the year will be led by the HVAC and Refrigeration businesses. Turn to slide 11 for the Commercial and Residential Solutions segment results. Commercial and Residential Solutions underlying sales grew 3% with a 2% reduction from currency translation, resulting in net sales growth of 1%, led by favorable market conditions in the U.S. Growth in the food waste disposers, storage and wet/dry vacuums more than offset declines in the professional tools business. Recent softness in the professional tools business reflects reductions in oil and gas-related spending. Favorable trends in U.S. construction markets are expected to continue, supporting an outlook for moderate growth in the second half of the year. Turn to slide 12 for the 2015 outlook. The global macroeconomic environment will continue to be challenging for the remainder of 2015, as strong headwinds with lower oil prices, strength of U.S. dollar and a broad slowdown in industrial spending, particularly in North America and China will place downward pressure on underlying sales growth across most of our businesses. Visibility is limited in this environment so our focus will be on controlling what we can. Near-term profitability will be negatively affected by volume deleverage as a result of the rapid decline to lower underlying growth expectations. Therefore, restructuring will continue to be accelerated and will now be expected to exceed $140 million for the year. Based upon these market conditions, we now expect 2015 net sales to decline 7% to 5%. Underlying sales growth is expected to be 0% to 2%, excluding a negative impact from currency translation of approximately 5% and a 2% deduction from divestitures. Reported earnings per share is expected to be $4.17 to $4.32, including a significant reduction from currency translation, the power transmission solution divestiture gain of $0.77 per share and accelerated restructuring costs of $0.09 per share. And I will now turn it over to Mr. David Farr. David Farr : Thank you very much, Craig. Welcome everybody and thank you for joining us today, both shareholders and investors. I will probably be longer than normal. I had some things I want to get out and discuss with my shareholders. Clearly, we had a very challenging tough quarter and the market headwinds that we\u2019re facing today has become much stronger in this over the last 60 days. But you know, we know how to deal with it. We\u2019ve been here before and the necessary actions, reviews, executions are underway and there will be more on this in a few minutes. We will continue to execute the tactical and strategic actions required to create long-term shareholder value of this company. The Board, the OCE and the senior management team fully understand and fully debate what needs to be done, the timing, the actions and when and how we go about it. Our actions clearly have been underway since February. We talked about this at the investor conference, but given the stronger and broader headwind, we\u2019ll now need to be deeper, broader and even more properly measured against where we\u2019re trying to take the company long term. April, underlying orders appear to be shaping up to be down 5% to 8%. So let\u2019s step back and review the where we\u2019ve been, where we\u2019re up to, the actions and with the discussion that we\u2019re having internally and basically how I see this as we\u2019re going forward. Now consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing in our monthly orders, we had a tough second quarter after underlying sales for corporation been nearly 5%, the last six months before this quarter hit us. The dramatic slowdown for the precise accountants out there is probably 4.75%. But for today it\u2019s nearly 5%. The slowdown in capital spending in the oil and gas industry and related markets have been faster and deeper than we anticipated. This has had a significant effect on the sales and profitability of our process business, resulting in deleverage and some unfavorable mix and actions will be needed to improve that at the proper speed. Overall impact has been a sharp drop in demand across most of our industrial businesses across the U.S. There is a lot of business around oil and gas that\u2019s being impacted. It\u2019s just not oil and gas spending. Capital spending on telecommunication equipment has decreased sharply -- sharply since early this calendar year as key cut companies space reduced investment levels due to slowdown in economy, due to regulations, due to laws whatever being put upon them in our customer base. A sharp decline and continuing transition to the data center designs negatively affected the result of our network power business. But there's nothing new and different from what we\u2019re seeing and we\u2019re taking the actions there also to protect ourselves. Overall, now the trailing three-months with April can be around negative 8%. This tells me the third quarter will be challenging. Third quarter sales could be negative, slightly negative underlying clearly with dollar they will be but slightly negative underlying unless there is a turn sometime in May and June. We have been through down cycles before. This is my third as a CEO of Emerson Electric. We are confident the businesses will come back strongly when the investment environment stabilizes. In 2009 and 2010, underlying sales in our process business declined for five consecutive quarters and then recovered strongly. Now we have no visibility on when that happens again, but we do know investments will rebound and we need to make sure we take the cost actions needed to temporary fix the profitability but also keep in mind we\u2019re not going to jeopardize our core technologies or our market share. As we've done in the past in this type of environment, we will be intensely focused on the levers we can control. Over the last several years we've made meaningful strategic investment to serve our customers and strengthen our market positions and now we need to refocus given the environment that doesn't look like growth but flat at best.  The markets changed and we need to react. We are taking the necessary target action, the cost of this corporation across this world both at the business level and the corporate level to get the cost of line for an environment we could be facing for many quarters, maybe multiple years of tough growth. The bottoms-up approach, each business unit, is evaluating where we need to have the investments and where we do not need those investments, where we need the capacity and where we do not need the capacity, how we deal with the stronger U.S. dollar, how do we compete against our dollar -- our euro-based competitors coming out of Europe, our yen-based competitors coming out of Japan, who have created through currency movements a significant competitive advantage on a price cost situation. We will continue to do the necessary restructuring. It will continue for the rest of this fiscal year. And I -- as I discussed with the board most likely through the first six months of fiscal 2016, as we take the actions necessary to compete, improve profitability and protect our market position in the world where the dollar is much stronger than it was this 12 months ago. Our current field with the current actions we identify to be 3,000 people across Emerson to achieve cost reduction of at least 150 and hopefully more on an annual run rate basis. There will be more actions needed, given what I see today and given the continued negative underlying growth rates that we've seen over the last three or four months. As you know and debated with me, both friendly and unfriendly, we\u2019ve been actively repositioning and evaluating our portfolio to improve the profitability, to improve the core growth opportunities and to improve overall quality of this company. We have divested 12 businesses with $3.5 million of sales over the last seven years. These divestitures have improved probability and improved our growth rates. We communicated previously that we will continue to evaluate the portfolio and we have underway today the divestiture of InterMetro storage business, which will happen sometime before the calendar year is done. We continuously discuss with the Board, the actions necessary both on acquisitions and restructuring and portfolio management, necessary to make Emerson a stronger, more profitable, faster growing business. The Board, nor the management team are afraid of taking the tough actions. And we will do what\u2019s necessary to improve our profitability, our earnings growth, our cash flow in a very tough environment. We will continue to be very discipline with our capital allocation. We will continue to look for the right acquisitions. We took one small and went to the Board today. I'm hoping over the next 12 months, we will see more assets available for us to invest in. The current focus is on improving profitability in a low growth environment. Our current focus is to improve our cash flow after we get through this dramatic down shift in our marketplace and take that money and invest it in the portfolio that will give us growth and profitability going forward. We will continue to aggressively look at the portfolio. We will take actions that are smart and disciplined. We will not take knee-jerk reactions at this company. It\u2019s not the way I operate. We intend to return approximately $3.8 billion for our shareholders this year through dividends and share repurchases. Over the last three years, we have returned a total of $6.5 billion or 63% of our operating cash flow through dividends and buybacks. We will continue to focus on high level of cash returns for our shareholders, improving our portfolio mix, driving value and doing what we can do best in this type of environment. We've been dealt a challenging hand. I\u2019m not afraid of that hand. We are taking the necessary actions across this corporation. The Board is fully engaged. The Board fully understands what needs to be done and is supporting the management team to the tune of getting these things done. We clearly see the next six months as very challenging to us and we can clearly see the impact of the dramatic drop-off in spending in many of our core businesses, the much stronger dollar and I'm not talking about translational impacts. I\u2019m talking about the fact that our global competitors coming out of Europe and Japan now have a unique advantage. So, we need to take the necessary actions to protect our position and improve our profitability over time. There is no quick fixes here. This is hard work and this management knows how to do it and we will do it. I do not like the quarter we just reported but unfortunately it happens and we will take the necessary actions to go forward from here. I appreciate the support of our shareholders. I appreciate the support of our investors and I truly appreciate the support of the Board and the management team as we work hard here over the next six to nine months to improve the position of this company and earn back the respect of our shareholders and our investors. So with that, we will open the floor for questions. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Hi. David Farr : I can\u2019t wait for that first question. I got my baseball bat out. I got my Rally Monkey here. I\u2019m getting the sword out. Who\u2019s first? Julian? Julian Mitchell : Yes. Hi, Dave. Just a question first on the operations. And I guess your revised fiscal year guidance implies operating margins bounced back quite a bit in process and in Network Power in the second half from Q2. Just wondered if there was some one-off or mixed issues that hurt margins in those two businesses that you think go away? David Farr : Yeah. The big issue, Julian is if you step back and look at what hurt the second quarter in a big way and we obviously have some hills to climb in the second half, is that our underlying U.S. sales were over 7.5% in the last nine months. Process is very strong in that time period. We went from underlying U.S. sales of 7.5% to negative 3% in one quarter. As we announced in February, we knew things were getting weak but they happened very quickly in a couple key markets -- U.S. and China and Latin America. We are sitting in a situation where our facilities have been repositioned in the last couple years in the U.S. We moved position, production into the U.S. and now with the stronger dollar, we will have to move things around and we are sitting absorbing some fixed costs that we have to deal with, which we have started initiating in early February. And we will start getting some payback on that in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But still we will be facing this headwind because of the dramatic drop-off in our core businesses here in the U.S. and the market mix. So what we are banking on right now is that we are quickly tackling the fixed costs, we are quickly tackling the costs and what we are seeing is we'll see some profit improvement as the year goes on. That\u2019s the measurement we are going after right now and Am I got exactly, right or we\u2019ve got exaggerated? It really depends how fast things drop-off. But right now that fixed cost hit us real hard in the second quarter and we are aggressively going after it. We spent, I think around $45 million in restructuring in the second quarter. We will try about spending another $65 million to $70 million in the third quarter. So, we will start getting payback on that as we go forward. So that\u2019s what the game plan is, is we\u2019ve got absorb that de-leverage. The other issue we\u2019ve got going on right now is we are going to quickly tackle the working capital, which means we take the production down and that will have a little deleverage impacted. So we are playing this game. We know how to play this game but I know that it\u2019s going to take us three, six, nine months to get through there to get that effect. But we will get the profitability back. There is nothing wrong with the core business as the profitability can\u2019t come back on. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And then just you talked on the call and the release about tactical and strategic actions and at the same time, the need to avoid a knee-jerk reaction. So maybe just clarify the timeline of how you are looking at businesses like Network Power in that regard, please? David Farr : I put my sword in the ground. I think almost 2.5 years ago I said 3 years so I don\u2019t think the timeframe has changed one iota. I do think that -- what we tried to do at the Board level is talk the day-to-day how do we get our cost of line quickly to deal with the price cost issues, to deal with the lower volume. And then strategically, you just don\u2019t want to ignore the strategic issues that we face as a company from a portfolio mix and we will do that on a systematic approach that makes sense. I mean, as you well know, my focus is if we are going to decide to get out of the business, I want to get out of the business that creates value for my shareholders. I am not going to cut and run just to cut and run. I think that is the wrong thing. I think my shareholders would be very mad at me if I did that. They expect me to manage the assets that we have here profitably and to create that value the best we can or to realize that value and that I am no different. Genetically that is how I built and you know that. Julian Mitchell : Right. Thank you. David Farr : Thank you very much, Julian. Operator : And we will take our next question from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan: Good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan: Hey, Dave, on the process, maybe a little bit more on what you\u2019re seeing in the different geographies, I mean North America obviously gotten a lot of the highlights, that you know China, LatAm, just what are you seeing and what\u2019s your current view on where this might head? David Farr : I do. I can give you a sense of that. Just generally from the businesses worldwide, the U.S. looks for us is kind of shocked, I would say shakier for the next -- from an industrial standpoint for the next two, three quarters. Europe is slowly getting better. We had a better Europe as you know. The one place that I am really concerned about is China in the lack of investments and the slowdown and I will get to specific business in a second. But clearly overall macro right now, U.S. is a concern to me. China is a concern to me. Latin America is a concern to me. Europe I think is getting slowly getting better. And then outside of China, we are doing pretty well. And then Canada continues to invest as they are trying not to lose market share in the oil and gas market. But if I look at the various businesses and I am trying to get the chart here which has it broken down by ordinary. I would say process right now is seeing a tough time -- a tougher time in China. They are seeing a tougher time in the oil and gas companies in Southeast Asia. They are doing better job in India. The Middle East has held up for us, because we had a lot of orders and they have not backed off and orders have held up what surprises me a little bit. Profit outside of Western Europe has seen an improvement, and I think we are going to start seeing an improvement out of the Western Europe export business. So I think that will get better. Latin America I think right now is going to be a tough year for process control. Just Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, so that\u2019s right now I see it. I think we haven\u2019t reached bottom in certain markets and that includes the U.S. And I think that we haven\u2019t reached bottom in probably China or we haven\u2019t reached bottom in Latin America. The rest of places seem to be stabilizing and you notice we are coming up a little bit. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. Great. And then just on this telecom piece, I mean obviously it\u2019s hitting you very hard right now, maybe just -- is that net neutrality related stuff or what else are you seeing there? And aside from, I mean it seems like that\u2019s kind of the near-term driver, are you happy with the way the data center piece of the business is performing, just maybe a little split between the pieces? David Farr : Yes. I think from my perspective, it is really hard in the last four months is the dramatic cut in spending from the standpoint of the impact of net neutrality. And also there is some shifting going on in the industry rather world and where money has been spent, not being spent. That\u2019s hit us pretty hard. That one to be honest really caught us, I mean, a little bit surprised in the dramatic cutback and how fast these guys can cutback as they reshift their priorities and that hurts us quite dramatically. And we are about going after the fixed cost there and taking the capacity out and down, but that takes us a couple of quarters. In Europe right now, our Network Power data center enterprise business, I like the improvement we are seeing. I see slow gradual improvement. I would say in North America right now there has been very little improvement. It goes up and down quarter to quarter. The customer base is not really moving forward relative to spending money and a big part of that customer base also excluding the telecom power but also the enterprise side of that, we sell lot into the telecom space and enterprise side too and they have really cut back in spending. And then the other place we\u2019ve seen a dramatic cutback is in China. The rest of the part of Asia is doing pretty well. So there has been another hit here and we are significantly taking restructuring across Network Power from a technology and the products we have today are likely have that\u2019s not an issue. It\u2019s just the fact of where we see it coming out at this point in time. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : And we will take our next question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Thanks, Dave. Good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Yeah. So, Dave, I appreciate all the extra detail on the actions. You mentioned a number of times in the prepared remarks that you\u2019ve seen European and Japanese competitors using the currency advantage. It sounds like that\u2019s done to cut price or done to be more aggressive on price, is that true? And how are you responding? Are you going to respond with discounts? So maybe just describe a bit more on that, Dave. David Farr : I think the short-term -- in the second quarter, the price cost issue other than price cost maybe issues around outside United States have been little. There has been some price cost issues relative to say eastern European businesses where we are sourcing and the movement on that. The price cost issues coming out of Europe and the Japanese competitors, we see that hitting us more in the second half and going into early next year. So that\u2019s why we got to get ahead of this curve, because we know they will, we know that we\u2019ve been here in this case before. It wasn\u2019t in my first two or three years as CEO that we had the euro at parity when we actually ran down at 85. I saw how the European competitors acted at that point in time. And I would say they are going to pick up the competitive nature of this. The amount of project opportunity out there is still I think still shrinking, so it\u2019s going to be more competitive and they have an advantage with the euro and the yen where it is right now. So we know their actions will be very I would say sharp on the pencils and sharp on the price. And we obviously will do what is necessary to protect our share, but we will also not going to do stupid things from the standpoint of having to give away price where we have the unique technology. So over the last several years we have the dollar helped us quite a bit and now we have it flipped. And we have to get our cost back in line relative to where we source things and where we position stuff which we will do to be able to compete and protect our margins. But it will take us six to nine months. Don\u2019t be surprised, it will take us six -- and we know how to play this game. And in the meantime, we will see them coming at us. It will be more the second half of the year on the pricing actions. Nigel Coe : And where do you think you are going to see the bulk of this pressure, do you think it\u2019s pretty broad based or do you think it\u2019s more centric within Network Power and Automation? David Farr : I think it\u2019s going to be broad-based. I think you will see across the industry. I think you will see it. U.S. companies have had a unique situation where I would say you go across the U.S., I don\u2019t care what companies you talk about be it industrial or consumer, U.S. companies have done very well in the last 10 years and gaining market participation in the U.S. marketplace. And I think you\u2019re going to see some of the foreign competition taking advantage of this dramatic shift in the dollar -- euro, dollar, yen situation. This is no doubt about it. This is just the Emerson Electric, trust me. Nigel Coe : No, I think you\u2019re right there. And then just a quick one on process margins, it sounds -- it seems like your guidance is baking in the sequential improvement in process margins, which is what we normally see seasonal. But as process goes negative in the back half of the year, which creates a bit more pressure. You mentioned you had to cut inventories. Do you think the process margins have bottomed in 2Q, or do you think there is a bit more pressure in the second half of the year? David Farr : What the margins face in Q2? I mean, I think I would say they got hit pretty hard this quarter and I mean based on what I see, they normally would come back up. We\u2019ve taken -- Steve Sonnenberg and the whole management team have worked extremely hard very earlier on the restructuring side, I would say they are going to get a little bit better. From my perspective, I want to figure out how to get their margin back up and so they have for the whole year to get back more online to where they should be. But there are a lot of things moving in that first -- in that second quarter, even including relative to selling a litigation suit. So I think that we\u2019ll get the margin back up in the third and fourth quarter. But clearly, these guys are taking action. Right now, I would say the action is underway. Process Management and the Network Power have been the big, big spenders of restructuring both in the second quarter and in the third quarter. So the Steve and his team knows what it means to get to that margin, they\u2019re going to get it. Nigel Coe : Okay. Dave, good luck. David Farr : Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Winoker with Bernstein. Steve Winoker : Thanks. And good afternoon, Dave and Frank. David Farr : Good afternoon, Steve. Steve Winoker : I like that enthusiasm. David Farr : I mean, if we decided -- I can\u2019t decide -- is there any reason to come to New York? You already asked all the questions. You probably did your good afternoon. Steve Winoker : There is always more, Dave. We can really get into it, right. David Farr : I am going to allow you to take two questions from you, no. Who all is going to talk, okay. And I\u2019m very slow answering questions. Steve Winoker : Just bring in the baseball bat, okay. David Farr : I got right here partner. Steve Winoker : So listen, I\u2019m trying to -- there was a time when you used to talk about the strength of the dollar being good for Emerson or a stronger dollar being good for Emerson. David Farr : Strong dollar good for the country I said. Steve Winoker : Okay. So I just want to talk about the cost base so for you. I mean as you\u2019ve gone international here on the dollar, what are the things that you can do beyond just restructuring on the material side? Are there other things that you can do that could actually change the margin story a little bit and help you on the pricing front as well? David Farr : Yes. One thing Emerson does have, as you all know we have a very global manufacturing base say for process. So we can shift where we make the product, either into Mexico, either into Eastern Europe, either into Asia and rebalance that to take advantage of where the currencies have weakened along like the euro or like the yen. So we have very strong manufacturing facilities in Mexico and we have manufacturing facilities in Eastern Europe. So you\u2019ll see us already in the capacity sitting there. So you\u2019ll see us merely moving in. We had just gone through a process over the last 12 months of moving manufacturing back into the U.S. And now with the capacity we have in certain and like all cost locations versus the dollar and the euro, we\u2019re going to quickly move there. The other thing we have to start moving our sourcing for the standpoint of both internally and externally and that takes six to nine months. And there we can get our cost back in line to get our margin back up both through the restructuring effort and moves but it takes us time. And then that allows us the pricing flexibility necessary to compete against countries that are playing the currency game against us. We do as a nation -- we as a nation and that\u2019s why you believe in the strong dollar. I think we cannot have the nation as a weak currency. I believe quite strongly that we will take the actions necessary to move stuff around the world and we\u2019re going to have the flexibility to do it. And we will do it and it\u2019s already underway. Steve Winoker : And what\u2019s baked into your planning and thinking, your best thoughts about trough volumes here. I mean, what do you think about oil prices? How important is that at this point to you sort of calling and volume starting to get better in two or three quarters or what are you thinking on that front? David Farr : My plan right now is that there is no growth. And you can say two quarters, three quarters, four quarters, five quarters, six quarters and what it takes for us to have increased earnings as we move out into that 2016 time period is what I\u2019m focused on. What actions we need to fix the cost structure to compete in no growth environment to allow us to show earnings growth and make 2015 the bottom of this one, my game plan. Steve Winoker : But when are you thinking things don\u2019t get any worst, maybe that\u2019s the way to say it from a volume perspective? David Farr : If I was that good, I wouldn\u2019t be a CEO anymore because I can go out and can run that and you wouldn\u2019t get quiet the same publicity that you have every time you open newspaper about how overpaid we are and how we tried to hurt people and I don\u2019t know. I mean, from my standpoint right now, I think as I look at the U.S., I look at what\u2019s going on, I look in Europe, I think you\u2019re probably talking early 2016 before you start seeing you can say things are turning back up even on the underlying volume basis. Steve Winoker : Thanks, Dave. David Farr : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Wood with Macquarie. Mike Wood : Hi. Thanks for taking my question, Dave. Just at a high level, you spoke about oil prices a bit, but WTI did fall to 45, now it\u2019s back above 60 today. Curious what type of lag that you see when you\u2019re taking to customer with bidding or quoting activity and how you might think that recent improvement could impact the orders? David Farr : I think the people -- I don\u2019t think that our customer base will move much in the thought process and going from 40 to 60. I think these guys -- our customer base is now, they have been shocked, they have been hit, they are reallocating capital. They have their own thing, they\u2019re looking at -- I think there is going to some prior consolidation in this industry. So there is some capacity could be coming out. So I think this space right now is set at price expectations that it could easily get hit again. And so these guys were managing their capital allocation such that they are going to cut spending probably for at least 12 to 18 months. And that\u2019s my view of it right now. And I don\u2019t -- I think there is more downward potential on the price of oil given what\u2019s happening in the world to slow down, what happens maybe in the Middle East if there is an Iranian deal. And let\u2019s say that there is more potential oil coming in the marketplace. So I think they need to be very cautious and I think they will be very cautious. Mike Wood : Great. And the $0.09 restructuring that you had cited, should we think about that paying off on one to one dollar ratio and have you taken a look at your CapEx, R&D goals or any areas respond there as well? Thanks. David Farr : Yeah. I think, our -- historically when we -- our restructuring is one to one. And so right now, the number we\u2019re looking at is about $140 million. I would say, as the year goes forward that number is going to move towards $150, $160 for the fiscal year. Most likely as you look at -- if you look out beyond that and total price of cycle paying is spending over $200 million in setting the cost structures its corporation. And capital right now, based on what I see, we are going to try curtail little bit, but I have set motions on redeploy the capital that we have started about 18 months ago and so in Eastern Europe and also in Mexico. And I also have what I would call risk hedging and capital from the standpoint of what I manufacture things. So I don\u2019t see our capital take a dramatic drop-off, but I would say as we get into 2016 and 2017 that capital number as a percent of sales will come down. Mike Wood : Thank you. David Farr : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn : Thanks. Good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon, Chris. Christopher Glynn : Hello there. David Farr : I have got [indiscernible] doing. Christopher Glynn : Oh! God. I think I want to go back two years ago. You get any start as you concerned that way. David Farr : We need a couple pictures. I think we have got it -- we need a picture we lost our base our ace. Christopher Glynn : Sorry to hear that. David Farr : Yeah. Actually, Chris, no sorry for that, that didn\u2019t sound very real, Chris. Christopher Glynn : The trade deadlines are ways out, you got sometime. Dave, in the past and today you\u2019ve kind a described the accordion aspect of your global cost structure and ability to respond to things like currency. Guessing, maybe there is a pretty big magnitude of opportunity to leverage that in process, but wondering if you could describe sort of the scope of what can be done there? David Farr : I mean from our perspective, we can move it around and it takes us time. We can both not only Process, but Network Power, Network Power has the same flexibility both in Mexico as they do in Eastern Europe, as they do in China. And so the Network Power has the same capability as does Process, as does Climate, as does most of all the industrial businesses. So from my perspective, we are going to go after that moving, where we source the biggest opportunity for us is actually sourcing, where we know the dollar base sourcing had become very competitive for us for about two or three years. Now we are going to start shifting out and that will create non-dollar base sourcing, which means there is probably less job in the U.S. and more jobs other places around the world. So we are already underway here and our cost of goods sold, pressures -- our SG&A pressures, we can deal with those things. And I mean that's the game plan we know how to play. We also know that it is going to take us six to nine months and we\u2019ll slowly get some benefit as we move into the second half of this year. It\u2019s -- that accordion is still is very workable and we\u2019ve had a lot of tactical meetings here within the corporation in the last five or six days and as we are try to expand thing and taken a real serious look at what we think is going to happen in the next three, four, five quarters. So accordion is moving right now and it\u2019s going to be moving pretty rapidly. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And then just going back to March, it seems like April didn\u2019t get any worse or maybe a touch better you mentioned something, we know is trending up? But what about -- what happened in March was maybe one-time in nature whether its channel flush or something else? David Farr : Don\u2019t believe that. Christopher Glynn : Okay. David Farr : I don\u2019t believe that. I think if you look at the underlying -- I think my personal opinion. I think inventories in the U.S. are still too high given the pace of business. I heard numbers were small for all my directors that imports, it took a surge in the month, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s March or April, that tells the imports are already starting to come in and so, you want to borrow pen? Frank Dellaquila : Yes. David Farr : You have incorrect, okay, he is already shaking his pen. But I think that this thing is got some lives to go, because I think there is a shift going on as people adjust relative to weaker demand and they also adjust as we look at this whole issue relative to imports going up and also the impact on the sourcing, which we just talked about. So there\u2019s two or three layers here that you guys are through and I think that\u2019ll have an impact on U.S. operations of all companies. Christopher Glynn : Got it. Thanks. Have a good day. David Farr : You\u2019re welcome. Take care. And for me a pen, shaking god damn pen around. Craig Rossman : You cut call, Frank, I am trying to use as long as I can. David Farr : Okay. Operator : And we will take our next question Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. David Farr : Good afternoon. Deane Dray : Hey, Dave. I\u2019m actually at the OTC show in Huston today at the Offshore Technology Conference and I was just at the Emerson booth, there was some good traffic there? But what I did notice was big emphasis on reliability consulting, maybe less on trying to sell equipment but more on a differentiated sale regarding efficiency and as you say and so forth? Is that going to be the part of go-to-market strategy to process over the near-term? David Farr : 110% correct. The issue here is there\u2019s been such a strong expansion in the oil and gas industry that the capacity went in very quickly not necessarily looking at optimization and now what we see with our capabilities from the people resources in our technologies is that we can optimize what they\u2019ve already invested in and we see the focus from a customer really shift hard that way and you clearly are seeing that in that trade show and you\u2019ve see it across not only the oil and gas but also the chemical industry and the power industry in a big way. So you are seeing this, this is going to be the game plan in our solutions organization and Jim Nyquist is totally focused on that. In fact one of the acquisitions that we took the Board today is very, very much focused in that same area and so that\u2019s where the game is going to be. Deane Dray : That's helpful. And with downstream being one of the brighter spots, maybe you comment on how resilient your MRO business for process has been and I know we had some refiner strikes, are you seeing deferred maintenance and what your expectation for the MRO side of process? David Farr : We haven\u2019t seen any differed action yet in the MRO and that's another reason why we have a big third quarter, typically third and fourth quarter, because we see more MRO action around that time period. So right now, we have not seen a slowdown of that. That would be the key issue for me relative to how our margins come back if we get into the second half of the year and then the day-to-day MRO. Once the [indiscernible] business really disappears then we\u2019ll have a lot more pressure versus the big projects. But right now it\u2019s holding up -- it\u2019s holding up from the perspective of day-to-day sales. So, I feel okay about that. Deane Dray : Great. Thank you. David Farr : You take care and stay in touch. And try not to hit anybody. You are not supposed to be driving around at the same time you are talking to the CEO of Emerson. Deane Dray : No, no. I am stationary. I am outside the conference. David Farr : Okay. You are on your feet. Don\u2019t walk across the street and get hit or something like that, okay? Deane Dray : Yes, sir. David Farr : Okay. See you later. Operator : And we will take our next question from Scott Davis with Barclays. Scott Davis : Hey. Good afternoon guys. David Farr : How you doing after, Scott? How you doing? Scott Davis : I\u2019m doing okay. I\u2019m trying to figure out the world and a lot of your comments are pretty bearish. So, I'm a little concerned. I mean, one of the things you mentioned, Dave, just the third kind of, I think you said down cycle since you\u2019ve been CEO. And the Fed is still providing plenty of stimulus out there and you\u2019ve seen the lending data and such. Are we walking into a recession here or is this a -- how do you define this, I guess? It sounds likes things are sequentially not getting better or in fact maybe getting worse to the exception of maybe Europe? David Farr : I think free money is running. Of course, we are already in the eight year of free money. Free money doesn\u2019t do anything for us. I mean it\u2019s a -- there\u2019s plenty of cash out there. Cash is not the issue. The issue is trying to figure out how to get a sustainable type of demand. I think what really is going on is we\u2019ve had a couple of major, major shocks to this industrial space that we operate in, with the price of oil dropping off dramatically and all that spending going on, with that shift in the dollar. And then also basically, there\u2019s better jobs out there but the jobs numbers are really not that exciting relative to employment levels that we've seen just 10 or 15 years ago. I mean, the workforce participation is not all that exciting. And then you\u2019ve seen the global China growth slowdown and Europe is getting better. But Europe\u2019s getting better at 2% out of 1%. So, I don\u2019t think we are in a recession. I just think just we are in this economic slowdown and if they are not careful here, you could bump this thing into a pretty tough period and that's my standpoint. I am calling the way I see it right now. I am dealing with an issue where business has dropped off dramatically and we are going to have to deal with that. And I don\u2019t worry about calling recessions, not calling recession. I am taking action now and so where we are. And I\u2019m not walking away from market share that we\u2019ve gained over the years and we are going to figure out how to win that and protect it, so that's what I\u2019m calling. Scott Davis : It makes sense. David Farr : I don\u2019t call recessions. There\u2019s a Fed that does that but I would say -- Scott Davis : I guess just trying to get my arms at sequentially, how much worse things get and are you the only guy who has the guts to call a spade a spade or is everybody else just not seeing it yet or something? But I guess that's for another conversation but I guess the\u2026 David Farr : I just have to be a little bit straightforward on this guy. Scott Davis : Yeah. Historically, it\u2019s correct. If you look at your stock price, Dave, I mean, based on your commentary, it sounds you can make an argument, assets are overvalued because earnings need to come down still. But based on your stock price, it's pretty depressed and how do you think about that versus M&A? I mean, the M&A market is still a little pricey right and it\u2019s going to be a while the prices come down but your stock is acting a little piggish here. At what point do you say buybacks may be a better plan and we will buy our stock when nobody else wants it? David Farr : Well, we did buy as you well know. We are buying well over $2.5 billion this year and we\u2019ll continue to buy next year, not probably at that level but we\u2019ll continue to buy. Clearly, I don\u2019t -- I think the stock has been hit pretty hard and there\u2019s reasons for that. And people are challenged relative to our underlying growth. But I can't worry about that day-to-day. I don't like the fact that stock has been hit hard. I\u2019m just dealing in the facts right now and the facts show that the underlying demand out there is weak and may stay weak for several more quarters and we are just going to get the cost to back down in line to compete against our international competitors. And if other companies don\u2019t want to do that, that\u2019s fine. Maybe other companies have better magic formulas, maybe they are doing a better job. So be it. But right now, I know what I am dealing with and I know we aren\u2019t competing and we are not losing. And I have no intention of losing and we are just going to get across the line to make sure that we can compete and drive the levels of possibility. Even in a tough quarter, we still had a very strong underlying profitability in this quarter. A lot of companies would love to have that underlying profitability in the quarter but that's not what Emerson finds acceptable. Scott Davis : Well said. Okay. Dave. Thanks and good luck, guys. David Farr : You take care. Operator : And we will take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Hey Dave. Good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hey. Also just thinking big picture here about the portfolio and how you do drive growth going forward? I mean, if 2014 was peak cycle for Emerson, you just grew earnings kind of 3% peak-to-peak over kind of a six or seven year period of time and obviously a lot of different stuff happened but that's kind of the nature of my question. David Farr : It\u2019s reasonable, Jeff that type of growth is not acceptable. Jeff Sprague : Right so. David Farr : This is why our stock is sitting where it is right now and I am not a fool. I understand that. I don\u2019t need to be told that and I fundamentally -- we are a premium company and I do not like what we face right now. So, we are going to figure out how to get premium underlying growth, both at the topline and bottom line, both through acquisitions, repositioning and restructuring, that\u2019s the game we plan. And I can\u2019t be more specific than that. Jeff Sprague : So then just shifting to Network Power then, you did say in February that the business is restructured, you now just need to figure out how to drive profitability. Obviously, just keep getting fresh curve balls in this business. I mean, other than kind of the passage of -- so like the better term kind of probation period that the business maybe under, what is that that you are looking to see there in terms of a decision point? David Farr : I think that from my perspective and what we\u2019re underway right now, I have everything I need at this point in time, trying to deal what I need to deal with. But it\u2019s just a function as I said, if we\u2019re going to drive our business, I want to figure out how to create the right value for our shareholders. I\u2019m not just going to dump and run if that is the decision. So, I think pretty much we have a good understanding of the marketplace. I see what -- I think what we can drive the profitability level to. Yeah, we had a tough quarter but a lot going on there. So, I mean, I think it\u2019s a pretty straightforward decision at this point in time. Now the question is what the best way of putting the execution to create the right value for my shareholders? Jeff Sprague : And then just one last one on this FX at the price, maybe wishful thinking but we hear a lot of other companies say, the Japanese and European guys aren\u2019t going to do that because they\u2019ve got global footprints like we do and what goes around comes around on currency. Do you think there is any merit to that? I mean, there is clearly nothing wrong with being girded for them to come after you. But do you think global footprints have changed enough that maybe the behavior does not get as egregious as you fear on price? David Farr : I\u2019ve one simple answer, no. Jeff Sprague : All right David Farr : I believe they\u2019ve changed enough. Jeff Sprague : All right. Thanks, Dave. Appreciate it. Operator : And we will take our next question from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Deepa Raghavan : Good afternoon. This is Deepa Raghavan for Rich Kwas. How are you today? David Farr : Good afternoon. How are you doing? Deepa Raghavan : Very good. Thank you. We hear you on rate pricing or optimizing cost structure and M&A and return of capital. But question is do you have any thoughts on relating share buybacks at this point in time, given where we stand right now with growth or CapEx or next opportunities in M&A? David Farr : At this point in time, no, we\u2019re going to spend $2.5 billions in share repurchase this year. I would expect right now we\u2019re probably getting in the $1.5 billion range next year. Mike, our focus is we\u2019re hoping to figure out how to find some asset as this marketplace is slowing down from an industrial space. There are some assets out there. And we\u2019re obviously working that real hard to be able to try to do more acquisitions as we get into the 2016. Our preference is to figure how to -- if we\u2019re going to position and move out certain assets, how to also try to get some acquisition. So we\u2019re working that pretty hard right now. But at this point in time, the $2.5 billion of share repurchase this year set. And I do not see changing that and I see next year be in somewhere in that $1 billion to $1.5 billion range. Deepa Raghavan : Okay. Question on METRO forward margins, I know it\u2019s been talked about in Q&A. But you plan the 3% in this quarter, I mean, I know the target still remain 12% margins over a medium term. But how realistic is that that we model for high-single digit margins for the full year, for your fiscal \u201815? David Farr : I mean, from my perspective given the significant restructure underway in network power. I mean that you\u2019re going to get hit at the EBIT line and so it\u2019s going to be challenging. But we still believe that 10% to 12% is doable as we reposition as cost structure and we get some kind of underlying improvement in particularly telecom space, which they\u2019ll come back within the next three to six months. So the business model hasn\u2019t change in that. It is going in and out of quarter, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change. Deepa Raghavan : Okay. Last question for me. Tax rate for the full year, I mean do I watch it on a normalize basis, its more 31%, 32% or 34%, 35% like last year? Frank Dellaquila : On operational basis we are looking at around 31%. The tax rate is inflated because of the gain on the divestiture. Operationally, we should be in the same within a percent or so where we were last year. Deepa Raghavan : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. David Farr : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. John Inch : Hey, good afternoon, Dave. David Farr : Good afternoon, John. John Inch : I want to ask about -- I want to go back to the currency issue and we\u2019ve been in this environment where the yen is been weak for a while. And it didn't seem that the Japanese ever stepped up to try for perhaps various reasons, stepped up to try and do much about it. And then in the relative -- in the relative perspective, I mean the euro is only collapsing short period of time. So just curious, what do you think is going on kind of around the world to all of a sudden have this increasing price-based competition, which I don't believe is unique to you. All of a sudden happen if it didn't really happen for so long in Japan, why is it happening more rapidly, given the relatively shorter duration of the euros decline? David Farr : I think for the yen standpoint, it is a function of -- in the early stages, the Japanese recover. There is more internal focus for investment as we thought inside Japan. And as that recovery as sort of petered out from the standpoint of the economics and if you look at the underlying growth rates in Japan are not that strong right now. They've had a turn externally. And we\u2019ve seen a ramping up in the last three to six months as they\u2019ve become much more aggressive around Asia and Europe and then also here in the United States. And this is the function, I think they're doing internally and now they\u2019re coming back out quite strongly. The European thing is a situation that we\u2019ve been here before we know its like, we know it takes a lot of gear up. And they\u2019ve been in a situation where they not had real underlying growth in Western Europe for a while. So now you\u2019re going to see those European EPCs, the European small businesses, the European large businesses now be competitive, so they can go out and compete against all of the U.S. companies or other companies around the world. And I think that is the natural behavior to do that. They\u2019re going to go and we\u2019ve seen that before and everyone keep saying, the rebalance are not going to do that. But I don\u2019t think they rebound that much. And from my perspective, you could see why they\u2019ve played that hand. You also had got a 25%-30% of competitive advantage on, just on a pure translation side. I think the games were played before and I think will be played again. John Inch : Yeah. I know especially in a slow growth world, it makes perfect sense. I want to ask you more of a strategic question around restructuring. If you go back to the last recession, right, lots of companies were able to very successfully preserve their profitability despite the steep downturn because they all advanced their playbooks of restructuring. I guess one of the questions or concerns I have and it\u2019s maybe less to do with Emerson but I\u2019d like to get your thoughts on this is that as we go into what could amount to another downturn and obviously, probably won't be nearly as severe. But is there as much action to take to be able to preserve profits like, very simplistically, haven\u2019t the lot of American industrial companies already downsizing and implemented lean and other tools to the point where they just isn\u2019t as much opportunity to cut costs if in fact we go into a more protracted slowdown, what are your thoughts? David Farr : I think the answer is again, no. I think there are opportunities. I think there\u2019s been a lot of new technologies. There has been new ways we can share technology innovation and innovation around the world. And I think, the companies can take advantage of that. And given the fact that the currencies don't move and the cost structures don't move, eke altogether allows companies that someone said earlier the firm that would balance. I think that there is opportunity that we see it today. And so I don\u2019t think the game is over with. I think there is always room for this. It maybe not China play this time where last time was a lot of China play. This time you are playing with different spaces and different locations and there is different approaches. So my fundamental belief is that the answer is no. There's room to fix your cost structure and there is room to improve your profitability. John Inch : And one more Dave, do you believe your cost structure is more variable today, given sort of this technology in globalization versus pass-through that not really that clear because obviously, we\u2019re more variable, you could preserve your profits far better than perhaps anyone anticipates, right? David Farr : I think we\u2019re less manufacturing based than it\u2019s historically been. So the people underestimate our software. They underestimate our systems, the solutions capability. I think, they all think that we\u2019re just a pure manufacturing company in this readout. I think the company has more variable cost than in the past. I mean, for us dealing with this pretty quickly, I think we have a lot more variable versus just pure fix large, fix manufacturing plants. John Inch : Got it. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. David Farr : Take care, John. All the best to you. John Inch : You too. David Farr : From our perspective again, I want to reiterate it was a tough quarter. I appreciate it. I appreciate your patience. Thanks for all the excellent questions. And I look forward to seeing everybody. And again, we\u2019re very much focused on execution right now in the company and in the discussion at the Board level as the last two Board meetings are very much based on the short-term tactical issues but also at the same time strategically, we want to return to our premium value growth company. And we will figure out what it takes to do that. And in the mean time, we have some other issues we deal with and we\u2019ll deal with ourselves. Thank you very much. I look forward to seeing all of you in the near future. Thanks. Operator : And this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you again for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

During today's presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. This conference is being recorded today August 4, 2015. Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Craig Rossman, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead. Craig Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you, Tim. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's third quarter 2015 results. The conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. I will start with the third quarter summary as shown on page two of the slide presentation. Net sales in the quarter decreased 13% to $5.5 billion with underlying sales down 5%. The continued pressure from lower oil prices has resulted in further capital spending reductions by global oil and gas customers, particularly those in upstream markets. Industrial spending remains sluggish on a global basis, but most significantly, in energy related and commodity markets. The strength of the U.S. dollar continues to be a significant headwind for our businesses. The third quarter order rates reflected the continuation of difficult economic conditions as the trailing three-month underlying order rates have been down in a range of 8% to 10% over the past four months. Order rates were under pressure by the sustained headwinds from lower oil prices and gas prices, capital spending weakness, across many of our global manufacturers, weakness in data center and global telecommunications infrastructure investment and the effect of the U.S. residential air conditioning customer pre-build. Turning to slide three, gross profit margin declined 120 basis points to 40.6% driven by volume deleverage as we adjust production and inventory levels, unfavorable business mix and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar on operations. Overall, profit margins remain at a significantly positive level. Restructuring expense totaled $36 million in the quarter and $89 million on a year-to-date basis. A significant level of restructuring expense is expected in the fourth quarter. Reported earnings per share decreased 18% to $0.84. The current market conditions require focus on execution of the strategic programs including global cost reduction actions. Turn to slide four for the third quarter P&L summary. As mentioned, net sales decreased 13% versus the prior year, with underlying sales down 5%. EBIT margin reflects the impact from accelerated restructuring costs. In the quarter, approximately 11 million shares were repurchased. Turning to slide five, underlying sales growth in the quarter was down 5% excluding unfavorable currency translation of 5% and the impact of divestitures of 2%. Global demand was mostly down with the Middle East and Africa being the exception up 3%. Across the other regions, the U.S. and Asia were both down 7%, Europe was down 2% and Latin America was down 10%. Turning to slide six, business segment margins declined 220 basis points to 15.5% primarily due to volume deleverage, unfavorable mix and increased restructuring expense. Operating cash flow in the quarter decreased due to lower operating results and taxes paid on the gain from the divestiture of the power transmission solutions business. Trade working capital performance was affected by the overall business slowdown. Over the next three months to six months, the global operations teams will be undertaking additional actions to align trade working capital with business conditions. Turning to slide seven for the Process Management segment results. Process Management underlying sales declined by 4% with a 6% reduction from currency translation, resulting in a net sales decrease of 10% in the quarter. Oil and gas capital spending remained weak as a result of lower oil prices. Upstream markets remained under the most pressure, while downstream activity in chemical and power markets continues to provide growth opportunities. Demand in the Middle East and Africa grew by 5% reflecting favorable activity levels across the region, particularly in midstream and downstream markets, while demand in Asia was down 7% with growth in emerging markets offset by slowing conditions in China and continued weakness in Australia. Europe was down 1% with strong growth in emerging markets offset by declines in mature Western European markets. Margins were down 250 basis points due to volume deleverage, unfavorable mix, the impact of the stronger dollar on operations and increased restructuring. Demand is expected to remain weak through at least the first half of the fiscal 2016 and given the continued downward trend in commodity prices, a significant recovery will not be experienced until 2017. Turning to slide eight for the Industrial Automation segment results. Industrial Automation net sales decreased 23%, as currency translation deducted 7% and divestitures deducted 11%, resulting in an underlying sales decline of 5% versus the prior year. The third quarter sales reflected continued softness in European demand, upstream oil and gas and industrial spending, specifically in energy related and commodity markets. Demand was down in all regions with North America down 11%, Europe down 2% and Asia down 1%. Margin decreased 80 basis points, reflecting volume deleverage and unfavorable mix. Market conditions will remain challenging with a gradual improvement in Europe and sustained headwinds from upstream oil and gas. Business capital spending plans are expected to remain weak given the softness in the global economies and global GDP is expected to be less in 2015 than it was in 2014. Turn to slide nine for the Network Power segment results. Network Power's net sales decreased 17% as currency translation deducted 5% and divestitures deducted 1%, resulting in an underlying sales decline of 11%. The third quarter reflected continued weakness in the global demand for data center infrastructure and telecommunication investments, with North America and Asia telecommunications spending down significantly. The difficult conditions were felt across the regions, as demand in China was down 28%, North America down 10% and Europe down 4%. Margins decreased 510 basis points, reflecting volume deleverage, lower price, unfavorable mix and increased restructuring. We expect demand to remain mixed in the near-term with areas of opportunity in data center infrastructure and telecommunications power. Turn to slide 10 for the Climate Technologies segment results. Climate Technologies net sales decreased 6% as currency translation deducted 3%, resulting in an underlying sales decline of 3%. Demand in North America was down 6%, driven by a double-digit decrease in U.S. residential air conditioning compressors, as customers continue to work through remaining pre-built inventory. Asia was up 3%, as growth in India and Southeast Asia air conditioning and refrigeration businesses more than offset slowing demand in China. Segment margin decreased 130 basis points primarily due to volume deleverage, higher warranty expense and unfavorable mix. When normalizing for the North American residential AC pre-build, the 12-month rolling sales growth is in line with the industry. We expect fourth quarter sales to be down modestly. Turn to slide 11 for the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment results. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales grew by 1% with a 2% reduction for currency translation and a 2% deduction for the transfer of a product line to another segment, resulting in a net sales decline of 3%. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by favorable trends in U.S. construction, growth in the food waste disposers and wet/dry vacuums more than offset declines in professional tools and storage businesses. U.S. consumer spending has been lackluster as recovery has been muted. Modest growth is expected in the fourth quarter, as favorable trends in U.S. construction markets are expected to continue. Turn to slide 12 for the 2015 outlook. Little change is expected in market conditions for the remainder of our fiscal year. Underlying sales will continue to be affected by reduced levels of capital spending in oil and gas markets, most significantly in upstream project activity, a continued broad slowdown in industrial spending, particularly energy related and commodity markets, a general weakness in capital spending by global manufacturers and sluggish growth in certain emerging and mature markets. As a result, underlying sales expectations will be lower, placing continued volume deleverage pressure on profitability. Restructuring expense is now expected to be in the range of $160 million to $180 million for the year. Based on the continuation of the difficult current trends and their increasingly negative impact on results, we've revised our 2015 outlook as follows : Net sales will be down approximately 9%, with a 5% deduction from currency translation and a 2% deduction from divestitures, resulting in underlying sales that will be down approximately 2%. Reported earnings per share are expected to be $3.97 to $4.07, which includes a divestiture gain of $0.77 per share. And with that, I will now turn it over to Mr. David Farr. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much, Craig. Clearly, extremely tough quarter and it got tougher as the quarter went on as we got into June. The big negative surprise for us in the month of June was the extreme weakness in China. We saw China drop over $100 million from prior year, down 14%-plus versus prior year. The bottom fell out in many of the core markets in China and we do not see that recovering anytime soon. Our oil and gas investments continued to weaken, as the price of oil, the price of gas has continued to slide. We now expect pretty weak orders in this space for at least the next 12 months to 15 months. And we're a bit concerned about the pace of recovery. So what we're focused on right now is getting our restructuring done, getting the company right-sized to a slower pace of business and making sure that we can improve profitability even with the lack of underlying sales. As Craig mentioned, year-to-date restructuring is around $90 million. Operations have geared up and are very active right now. I would expect the number, to be honest, somewhere between $70 million and $100 million in the fourth quarter, which will probably be in the $160 million, $180 million, maybe a little bit higher, if we get the work done. There's a lot underway around the world. From my perspective, the restructuring from when we started it back in early February \u2013 from when we started this to when we finish this sometime early 2016, you're going to see SG&A, personnel head count down 8% to 10% from beginning to end, so a major undertaking around the world as we continue to reposition the company for a weak market. Not much I can do about the market at this point in time. We faced the other issue of obviously strong competition coming out of the weaker currency markets, in particular out of Europe and Japan. Those things we have to deal with and that's why we've to get our cost structure in line. As you've seen, the orders have continued to stay weak, in the negative 8% to 9% range. I would expect that to continue for the next quarter at least. We have not seen any indication to say that things are going to get much better. So we're focused on dealing with weak orders, weak sales and obviously, weaker production throughout our facilities. So production's coming down, inventories will be adjusted, we will get the cash flow back, most likely a cash flow we top as we go into the fourth quarter, but we'll get that into that fourth calendar quarter, our first fiscal quarter. We'll start recovering that as we get that production back in line and we start liquidating the inventories that have been built up over the last 12 months to 18 months as the slowdowns happen. The global teams are acting fast. The global teams, obviously, are clearly focused on the short term and the restructuring necessary to get our costs back in line, to get our production back in line and to make sure that we can improve our profitability even with an environment that we're seeing right now that we're going to see minimal if any type of growth for the foreseeable future. At the same time, the teams are very focused on dealing with what we announced at the end of June from Network Power. Also, our Industrial Automation, LEROY-SOMER Control Techniques business and the continued divestiture of InterMetro business, as we continue to structure the company, the focus on segments that we want to invest and grow over the long term. In the short term, we're very much focused on execution around costs, execution around getting our balance sheet back in shape, and then, we'll continue to move forward at the right time and the right pace, as we see the core markets recover, and as we see some other investment opportunities in the two business segments that we're focusing on going forward. Net-net, obviously, not a pleasant quarter, one to deal with and one to report. Fourth quarter's going to be equally as challenging as we've had sessions with the operating leaders here in the last couple of weeks, and again, we're going to be meeting with them again on Thursday, Friday this week. It's all about getting the actions necessary to get the cost down, to get the production down, and deal with the marketplace that we're dealing with right now. From our perspective, we're not losing this market, it's just a tough market for us, and there's no way to color it other than that. It's tough and we're dealing with that toughness at this point in time, and that's where we are. And so, with that, I'll open the floor up for questions. Operator : We'll take our first question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So I guess, Dave, look, it's \u2013 the fundamentals just continue to get worse, the market's not getting any better. I'm just wondering like, how do you feel comfort that you guys are doing enough from a restructuring standpoint, at this point? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You give your best shot, as we look at the forecast, as we look at where we see things going, and we bite off as much as we can do. And what's underway right now is a lot, and we're impacted with big chunk of this company with a lot of costs, and it's not really facilities we're dealing with. Our overhead structure, right now, trying to get it down, and at the same time, we're going to have to deal with our overhead structure, as we go into a smaller company, as we move out of 2016. So I firmly believe we've spent a lot of time on this. I feel that we have the right actions underway, and we're taking the right amount of costs out. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And I guess like the $225 million that you expect to spend by the first quarter of next year, I know you've talked about a payback of one-to-one. Can we see the \u2013 will we see all of the payback by fiscal year 2016 or is that some of that going to bleed into 2017? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We're hoping to get close to $200 million in that fiscal 2016. Our game plan here is to get our costs down in a very difficult volume environment, so we can improve profitability, improve earnings in a tough marketplace. That's why we're taking this hard and quick action we're taking, and you're dealing with people here. And this is \u2013 we're not \u2013 there's not a lot of facilities we're rationalizing here, because our facilities are pretty well rationalized. What we're dealing with is an overhead structure of trying to get their costs out so we can drive that profitability to the bottom line. That's how you get that \u2013 the savings so fast. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Fair enough. Maybe one last question and I'll get back in queue. I know it's still early, but any thoughts yet on, you just announced that the strategic alternatives for a few of your businesses. Any progress yet, any interest on those businesses, just any color there would be helpful. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's pretty \u2013 it's early. I mean we've got \u2013 we've obviously had some interest, but it's too early to deal with that. We're working down the spin route right now. It's too early to talk about it. I think it's going to be worked here for the next three months, four months, five months, six months, and we'll spend that from that standpoint. InterMetro action, most likely will be done sometime before the end of this calendar year. We're targeting sometime in October. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks. I'll get back in queue. Operator : We'll take our next question from Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good afternoon, everyone. Dave? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, so the first question is, I mean really kind of challenging numbers across the board globally. Do you think there's an issue of share loss here in addition, because we have seen very weak numbers globally, but not to the extent maybe in this variance for the quarter. So how do you speak to that or can you speak to the \u2013 are you leveraged to a particular end market or sub end market, particularly with respect to China? Just anything, any narrative around that would be helpful. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, I mean our China business has held up reasonably well for the last 18 months. In China, we don't firmly believe we're losing business at this point in time. I mean we don't see any indication of that. But we're \u2013 in China, we have very strong markets relative to the strategic owned enterprises, the state owned enterprises, which have really cut back on spending here in the last three months or four months as that government has ratcheted back some of the issues they're dealing with. So if you look at our Process business, as you look at our Enterprise business in China and if you look at some of the other Climate businesses, we're seeing these where the state run enterprises have really curtailed, stopped spending and they did it very suddenly. So I mean this is something new from our perspective to see that type of drop-off that quickly and until we see some kind of stabilization within the China market, the China government, I'm a little bit nervous about China and the recovery there. So we're expecting the next couple quarters to be pretty tough there, but that's what it is. It's around that China \u2013 it's just those spending at our key customer base. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then I guess as a follow up, Dave, I know it's early and you get the restructuring, the restructuring benefits, but just conceptually thinking about 2016, do you have a visibility to say hey, we could be close to the bottom here in terms of EPS degradation or just too early to tell? I mean what's your view of 2015 versus 2016? Is it possible for you to grow in 2016? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think the big issue for me right now is we had a very strong first fiscal quarter of 2015. We're up almost 5.5% underlying growth. We're up very strong earnings, double-digit earnings, and I think the visibility right now is very challenging, because I know I got that big hill I've to climb sitting right out in front of me and that \u2013 the fourth quarter was very strong for us last year and our first fiscal quarter is strong. So it's a little bit early for us to see how we come out of that as we get through these next two quarters. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: This is \u2013 yeah. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean that's the big issue right now. The next two quarters, we're looking at the huge walls we have to get through and see what from an order standpoint and backlog can we get up there to get some kind of growth in the second half of next year. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And how do you think about M&A in this environment, when the prospects of a cyclical rollover and the bid/ask maybe get widening between seller expectations and buyer expectations? Do you think this cools your potential appetite for M&A or your capability to get things done of size? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. And we'll \u2013 if the right thing comes along, we have the capability of doing it. Right now, we're looking at divestitures and spend. If the right opportunity came along from an acquisition standpoint, we'd jump on it pretty quickly. I don't think that has any issue for us. We understand that. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your time, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay, you're welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mike Wood with Macquarie. Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just another question on the share with Emerson, just specifically with Network, that high single-digit underlying order decline, that does seem worse than some of the peers. I guess more peers exposed to power management not seeing severe declines. Can you maybe speak to, is it the data center and telco specifically or how your power management sub business is holding up? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. I mean the core business is holding up. We had a very strong \u2013 we had some big project wins last year at this point in time. We also had \u2013 we have a very strong presence in China which is unique, in our telco space in China and North America telco have really cut back in spending. So that's why you see those numbers are a little bit more drastic than our competitors. Underlying business is pretty much in line with that, but the telco spend, both in China and North America, very difficult. Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Right. Very helpful. And then just could you give us an update on the inventory on the Climate side and when that might be worked down? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We could relook through the cycle, because from the standpoint, we look at 12 months, it's pretty well trending. I would say right now, our estimate \u2013 not estimate we know 1.1 million units were pulled forward. I would say they're probably 80% through that right now. We should start seeing some North America refilling(23:33) \u2013 production is really \u2013 our inventories right now, production levels are low, so we expect to start seeing that flow through in the fourth quarter. However, the issue for us, the comparison will be very difficult, because last year was when we were selling it both in the fourth and the first quarter, but we're seeing it come back in. If you look at the underlying, I would say pace is improving in North America. So I'd say they're getting through it pretty quickly. Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Johnny Wright with Nomura. Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just can you comment, Dave, around the competition out of Japan and Europe? Is that partly reflected in sort of the pricing environment, and is that on the Process side? What are you kind of seeing there from competitive pricing perspective? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean we have Japanese and European competitors across most of our businesses, both on the \u2013 Process side, Industrial side and Climate side. And clearly, with the weaker currencies, they have the opportunity to price, to drive that business their way. We're working extremely hard. And one of the reasons we're working so hard on the costs is because we do not want to lose any position in this situation where we are at a huge disadvantage with a stronger dollar against our European and Japanese competitors. So the pricing is definitely tougher. And from our standpoint, we're dealing with it. The one advantage we do have is we get into the 2016 environment is with the weaker commodity environment, the weaker material environment, we will start getting benefit from that as we get into the first half of next year. And that's a big advantage for us and will help us offset this price cost. Right now, I'd say we are still \u2013 as you understand, we look at this price and cost, we're staying probably pretty close to being neutral or slightly green, and the key issue for me is to stay ahead of this power curve. Yes, we have pricer (25:30) pressures, in particular from the weaker currencies out there, but the commodity supply side guys are working extremely hard right now to get the respective cost reductions to help keep us price costs green as we get into this tougher price environment in 2016. So that's where the war is right now and I feel good about the battle and I feel good about where we are. Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then sticking with Process, from a vertical perspective, obviously upstream oil and gas staying pretty weak, but some of the downstream businesses like Chemical and Power actually seem to be holding up relatively well. Maybe you could talk about what you see there in terms of quoting activity and how you see those verticals holding up into 2016? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: The downstream, in particular the Power, has held up extremely well, and certain chemical segments held up extremely well. The order pace is at record levels. It creates a little mix shift for us a little bit, but the pressure is on profitability. But that activity is very, very good right now and we feel good about that, in particular, both in North America and in Europe. Asia is not that good. India is good for us right now. But downstream in Power and downstream in the petrochemical area we see good pricing. We're a little bit nervous right now relative to \u2013 there's been a lot of actions by major global oil and gas companies here in the last two weeks and that will obviously start flowing back as they continue to get pressure on their capital spend. And that could possibly have an impact on what we would call their MRO, the repair business. If they get a lot of pressure on cutting their capital even more, they'll cut back in certain areas in the MRO area and we'll start feeling that. That's another concern I have right now with the continued weakness of the price of oil and gas, which \u2013 where's the price of oil today? Down $45 \u2013 where is it, $45? So that bothers me a little bit there. Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thanks, guys. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Steve. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, Dave. If we go to 2016, just follow up one of your earlier comments, if in fact revenue did go negative next year and was say down 1% or so, could you still drive margin expansion in that environment with all the puts and takes that you're talking about? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: That's the goal. That's the goal. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: That's the aim. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yeah, go ahead. Sorry. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: That's the aim. That's what we're trying to do. Every operation guy's trying to figure out how to deliver improved profitability with no growth or slightly negative growth. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Right. And the kind of \u2013 I mean if we sort of think about what's possible in that goal given all the restructuring that you're doing, when you're calling out restructuring, it sounds like through at least the first quarter, but clearly in the environment that you're describing, it's kind of hard to imagine that you wouldn't be restructuring through much of the year. Is that a fair comment? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: What we're trying to get done \u2013 we'll do some in the first half of next year, but we're trying to get it done so we can stabilize the business. And we've identified where we want to go with the restructuring, we've identified the costs, we have a map where we think things are going to head out, and that's where we're focused right now. I don't \u2013 my objective is get this \u2013 the major work done as we get into that second fiscal quarter next year. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Right. And I guess if I also compare everything that you're going through right now compared to what you went through in 2008-2009, one difference it seems, maybe \u2013 I don't know if I'd call it a bright spot, is that at least the order rates are not getting decelerating any faster it seems from the \u2013 but is that just a temporary thing? I mean based on what you're seeing in the front lag (29:21) and all these quoting activities that there could be another step down from here? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I'm glad you saw a bright spot in there, Steve. I'd give you \u2013 I'm going to give you... Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I'm looking. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I owe you a glass of wine for that one. I don't know if there are any bright spots here, but... Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I got my magnifying glass out, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're getting half a glass of wine on that one. Okay. At this point in time, we do not see it stepping down on the order pace. We look at the trend lines, we look at the various businesses; it looks like it's bouncing around this bottom. The question is, is there anything that's going to pull it back up? We know what the comparisons are like for the next couple of quarters, but I mean I don't think \u2013 I don't see it as a step-down at this point in time. I mean it looks like it's trying to bottom here. And I mean I've called this before and I've got my ass kicked, to be honest, and that's not a swear word, Steve, you know. It's kickboxing here. I've been kicked around the ring a couple of times here this year. And it looks like it's forming; I don't see another step-down at this point in time (30:26). Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And it... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Unless you saw a sudden break in oil or \u2013 I mean you saw another sudden break in commodities down, say, into the $30s or below, then that would create another problem. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then finally, non-res, just, you spoke about the res pressure, what are you seeing on the non-res side? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Non-res North America is \u2013 we've had a decent environment. It's continued to weaken. I mean the actual \u2013 what I would call the capital spending, the type of products that we sell have not been all that exciting. There's been some non-res construction, but the basic capital spending environment has not been very good in North America and \u2013 in the industries we serve. We don't serve the automotive industry, and so it's been very anemic at best, and there's been very little recovery. And then you see a lot of drop-off as any \u2013 all the industries that support the broad oil and gas industry, both here in North America and in Latin America and around the world, so it's been pretty broad and it's been business-by-business. If you look at the segments that we look at, this is pretty broad across very many businesses here. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. Great. Thanks, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thanks, Steve. I owe you half a glass of wine for that... Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Next week. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: ...slight positive you gave me there. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: A couple of beers. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. Operator : We'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thank you. Just a question on the gross margins. I guess they got up to about 42% second half of last year, they're now down to 40%. Maybe pause out between mix and volume deleveraging, which one was more important within that? And then when you're looking ahead, how do you think about the ability to hold the gross margin at around 40% considering price cost and (32:19)? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, it's about 50%-50% that degradation there. We still feel very good about, as we \u2013 recovery structure and stuff like that, we'll get this thing moving back up. I still believe there's two \u2013 from the 42%, I still believe there's about 200 basis points improvement in the GP margin for the company. So we're clearly going through a lot of restructuring right now, there's a lot of mix going on and there's a lot of deleveraging, but the underlying fundamental GP margin of this business is still pretty good, and it'll move back up into that 44% range as we get there. Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. And then just within Industrial Automation, obviously, a very big drop in North America there in the quarter. Maybe just remind us how much of that business, globally or North America, you think is direct or indirect oil and gas? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: All \u2013 I mean in the North America, it's pretty heavy oil and gas. Craig Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.: Total is 15. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, 15 is the total, but in North America, it's very heavy because it's Caterpillar. Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: And so, the Caterpillar business is off significantly and that's primarily North America business, so that's what's driving that down, both from the standpoints if you look at what they \u2013 that we serve into their solar type of business and also their generational oil and gas platforms in the mining area. That's off significantly as they continue to take inventory out, they continue to take their production down. So we expect that's going to keep running this way for the next couple of quarters, as they keep doing what they're doing, but that's what that is primarily. It's very heavy oil and gas. Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. And then just lastly... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Energy is related \u2013 yeah. Go ahead. Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): ...got it. And then quickly on Process, you touched on MRO earlier. So I guess, have you seen MRO hold up until now and it's all been \u2013 CapEx has been coming off in the orders and sales? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. We've not seen the MRO come off yet, but I've gone through enough these cycles, as you guys well know, I'm a little bit older than you. And when I see the oil companies really under the pressure right now, they cut capital even more from their shareholder base. I know eventually what that means is they'll cut into the core MRO. And so, I would expect the next six months for our Process business to start seeing some of the MRO business gets cut back, which won't help us. It will be another little headwind for us, but we have no indication. I just know what happens. I mean these guys are going to get pressure to cut capital. We know that's going to happen. Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Understood. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You take care. Operator : We'll take our next question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Hi, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Hello Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just going back to China, your comments about June sounds quite frankly quite disturbing. What do you think caused the drop off in June, Dave? Is it liquidity or is it the government telling you yes, we need to pull back in spending? What do you think caused that? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: The major state owned enterprises, there has been a lot of continued crackdown on the ethical issues, the arresting and replacement of management team. A lot of people are afraid to make decisions. They're going to make bad decisions. So we've seen this on a broad base and a lot of our customer base across China where there's been a curtailment of spending as they figure out what's going to go on relative to the leadership. And this whole uncertainty around China and sort of the leadership of who's in charge, who's not in charge relative to the businesses and so there's been a big push in this area again and it's obviously reacted very strongly in some of our customer base which are a lot of state owned enterprises and customers in both the Process world and the Network Power world, in particular. And they got hit real hard in China. And I expect that's going to continue until we see some clear direction of stability in the leadership of the various companies out there which a lot of those companies are having a lot of the management changes right now. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So you've seen a big divergence between the SOEs and the private companies? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then based on your comments around orders the next three quarters to four quarters, I think you said that they're going to remain quite weak. And then given that you're telling your managers to basically aim to restructure, to grow margins on going back down to (36:53) sales, would you suggest that we base our models on that basis, Dave? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. I think it's \u2013 my firm belief is you got to wait till I get through these. I got two big mounds we've got to get through here, both the fourth quarter which was pretty strong for us last year and the first quarter. We got to see how we get through those mounds, how we see the underlying order pace, has it reached that bottom, and I think it's a little bit too early to bank on that. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Fair enough. And then, just finally, Dave, on the Process margins recovered from 2Q into 3Q, up about three points Q-to-Q ex restructuring, with very little help from volumes, so I'm wondering what drove that. Was that cost saves from restructuring? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Was there a mixed benefit Q-to-Q? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We're getting the cost out. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Jeff. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hey. Dave, just back to the MRO and OpEx versus CapEx discussion. We've heard from a lot of companies, it's actually a little bit the opposite, that the OpEx has been cut, because that's what their customers can easily cut and perhaps the CapEx comes later down the road. Does that intuitively makes sense? Is there something different in your business mix (38:22)? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: What I said is that up till now they've been cutting the project spending \u2013 the capital spending, and now, my concern is with the most recent two weeks of all the announcements coming out of the major oil and gas customer base out there, they're cutting capital again, they're cutting project again, and my concern is they're going to start cutting into the MRO base which has held up until now. I'm just giving you my gut feel for this thing, that's what I was telling people, that is they continue to get pushed by their shareholder base to cut their capital spending and protect their free cash flow, they're going to start going into MRO here in the Process world. We've seen it in the past. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : How much do you think Emerson internal CapEx declines in 2016? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: That's where we finished this year; it will go down next year. I would say that we're going to be down to 2.8% of sales level. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And then just last one from me, Dave. Share repo, you do have a fair amount of liquidity. You expressed the willingness to do deals, but just wonder you feel like the organization can take on a large deal in the midst of all this change, and would you prefer repo over deals or is there any particular prioritization there? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: If the right strategic deal came along, we will slow down repo and do the deal. In the meantime, right now, we're banking on probably around $1 billion right now for next year in share repurchase. And so that's where we're going to focus, but if the right deal comes along, we'll do it. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon. Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Dave, the third quarter restructuring was well below plan. Now, you have a big target for the fourth quarter. So just wondering what were the timing factors some of the prioritization that caused that to move around? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's function around announcing in certain markets and giving out the proper notice, in particular, outside the United States. And so, it took us a little longer to get approvals, and now, we're moving forward, we have those. And so, we pretty well have this in sync right now as we move into this fourth quarter. Sometimes you guess a little \u2013 not guess, you plan a little wrong and if it takes longer to do the discussions and negotiations, then you missed it by 30 days or so and that's basically what's going on there. But it's in the pipeline, it's coming. And the question is how much can be announced and discussed with the organizations around the world, and that's why I think it's a broad range here from the fourth quarter, it's a function of what can be formalized from the discussions and negotiations. Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, makes sense. And then, in Network Power, could you go into a little more detail on the negative price there? I don't think that was mentioned last quarter. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: China. It's really \u2013 it was very \u2013 I mean the markets dropped off in the big enterprises; they were using this leverage to drive price down. The local producers are all looking for business right now. The markets weakened and their export ability has weakened because of their marketplaces, and so, therefore, they're looking at dropping prices to try to protect and that's \u2013 we're going to have that situation going on hard in the power area in particular across China. Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Rich. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : On Process, so at $45 to $50 oil relative to the restructuring you have in place, now, if this continues, do you envision having to do a lot more beyond that? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think we're pretty well sized in the $40 to $50 range right now and my next threshold is it possible that \u2013 that will create \u2013 that's going to create some very difficult challenges that we're going to look at how we reorganize and to take costs out to protect that profitability. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. But that's in this range you feel okay? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, we feel okay here. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Okay. And then, going back to not this past Investor Day, the one before in 2014, so you had this big initiative around spending. I know that probably affected some of your businesses that are being separated, but what's the latest on that? And I assume that's been cut back in a meaningful fashion here (43:10). David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: That's been cut back in a very meaningful factor. I mean clearly, the opportunities for growth right now are not there, so we're curtailing that spending where it doesn't make sense and it's been cut back quite significantly. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Is there anything that you're doing spending on in this environment? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, we still have some \u2013 from a technology standpoint, from an innovation standpoint, we're still spending money, but we're being very selective and a lot of projects are being pushed out (43:39) slow down. So yes, including some of the Oracle investments, some \u2013 other things like that we've got to slow down that stuff. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then just a last one, quick modeling question. For next year, typically, you run on the three-year incentive comp where it gets \u2013 there's kind of a double up every three years. So as we think about next year, usually, at the pretty big ramp, when you get into a year like next year, so is that still the case? I mean I don't know Frank can comment on that. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. There'll be the overlap next year. Right now, we're looking at 50 to 75 but it's early... Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: ...yet to tell exactly what that's going to be, but you're right about the structure of it, there will be an overlap next year and that will be the biggest year for that. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah, I was hoping to get a little more like calibration on the restructuring in terms of you said head count and SG&A could come down between 8% and 12%. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: 8% and 10%. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : 8% and 10%. Okay. Is that \u2013 how does that compare to the previous restructuring actions that you've taken and how quickly do you think you can get that depth of cuts done? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: On a salary basis, head count, that's pretty normally what we've gone through before; you go back in the 2003-2004 time period, because most of this restructuring is coming from not manufacturing, it's coming from a salary base. We're not closing facilities down \u2013 we've a couple of minor ones, but they're very, very small as we move them around. So this is in line with other significant programs we had across this company and I would say based on how we started and where we are right now, our goal is to have this done as we get to the middle of 2016. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And this wasn't clear, or I may have missed it. Does this include restructuring actions in Network Power? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: This includes \u2013 yes, I mean Network Power will be \u2013 is going to be with us in 2016. Yes. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And you also mentioned that there are changes needed to the balance sheet. Is this related to the spend and divestitures or was there anything else you're referring to when you talked about balance sheet? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: What I referred to \u2013 the balance sheet was, I want to get the balance sheet strengthened and from the standpoint of \u2013 as this volume has dropped off, we have working capital captured on our balance sheet right now, both from a receivables and an inventory standpoint. And we want to get those levels down to an appropriate level. It usually takes us a couple of quarters once we stabilize and we expect that to be done, I would say, sometime early in the calendar year of 2016. On past looks at it and where the trend line is going right now, that's where I'd say it's going to be. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon. Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, Dave. Just on the idea of orders or trying to find a bottom here, at least geographically, it doesn't sound like that's going to be from China, right? That area (47:01) sounds like it's getting worse. Is there, either geographically or by business, do you think there's an offset? Is Europe feeling much better to you, or what would be the offset to China getting worse and that stabilization of orders? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: From our perspective, the stability will come in from Europe. I think there's not been a robust recovery in Europe. I think Europe has sort of muddled along at a low pace. But that's where I would see some improvement versus our \u2013 China. I would expect us to see some improvement in North America, as we come into this time period. And that's where I'm seeing it right now and that's where I'll see it. And we're not going to see it in China. You're right. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : And then, specific to Network Power, obviously, the business there is under a ton of pressure and I mean China is a big part of that, but just broadly, pretty weak and yet you say demand is expected to remain mixed. Can you talk about opportunities in data center and telecom? Is there a light at the end of the tunnel there where you're actually seeing things you're bidding on and opportunities for order improvement in that piece? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I don't think you're going to see anything in China until the spring of 2016 relative to new opportunities of substance. I think you see day-to-day \u2013 our day-to-day business is okay in those marketplaces, but I think until you see some big opportunities, I think it's going to be into the spring of 2016. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Steve. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : On the Process side and the margins, so I guess \u2013 should we still think of this mix dynamic as MRO good, projects a little bit weaker? I mean is that something you're planning on kind of fighting through as this MRO drops off or is that \u2013 does that kind of \u2013 just when things go down like this, it's just more about taking the blunt actions on restructuring to offset that? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: A couple of things happen, Steve, on this type of business. When the large projects slow down, we have \u2013 typically what we'll see is a smaller type of project business and that business is usually better profitability wise. So if you think about the profitability, the hardest for us are the large, the smaller projects are good and the MRO is even better. And so, right now we're seeing \u2013 as those large projects are cut back, they're still doing some smaller stuff, medium-sized stuff and that's good project business for us. So I think the mix right now is still helping us a little bit in profitability, but it's not a big movement. We still have the pressure of some of the big projects moving away through and some of that mix, but we're going to have to get the cost out to deal with the issue of a general slower-down pace of business, but I think it's going to be a little bit of both. It's not just MRO and large; there are some good medium-sized projects in there, which there is a good pace of that going on out there right now. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then on your mindset, I mean I asked a similar question to another one of the companies we cover last week about restructuring in this environment, but acknowledging the competitive threats that are out there. I mean, how do you weigh that, because you just talked about kind of trimming some of those investments? How do you keep your guys focused on the mindset of defending or even growing share while really battening down the hatches and delivering for guys like us on the cost side? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You have a lengthy (50:50) debate with each of the business leaders on this very specific issue, that no one wants to jeopardize the longer-term opportunity. So we're going to look at things that maybe aren't as critical and that's where you're going to cut and you're going to figure out we red circle, we circle, we ring fence areas that we must protect for those strategic reasons and then we'll go deeper on the other side. That's how we go about doing that. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. One last question. I think you issued some debt in the quarter. Net debt is up I think like $600 million or $700 million quarter-to-quarter. How will that trend? I know the filing said you'll use it for corporate purposes. How does that trend over the next couple of quarters? Will that begin to come down or is that now \u2013 you used it for some buyback, maybe some cash management dynamics because of your foreign cash that's overseas? Just what's going on with the debt levels over the next couple of quarters? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's not going to change much. It won't change much. If we're effective of getting out the cash by the end of the second fiscal quarter next year, then the debt levels will come down a little bit, but it's not going to change much. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company. Gautam J. Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Gautam. Gautam J. Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: You mentioned the desire to bring down inventory and the resulting kind of absorption that you're going to have to take. Is that going to be concentrated in Process or are you talking across the board? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Across the board. Across the board. I mean, obviously, Process and Network Power are the biggest dollars of inventory, but it's across the board and no one's really out of line. It's just that where we see the pace of business going which is going to be weak for several quarters now, we need to get that inventory back down. So we'll do it very systematically, one, not to shock the heck of our supply base, but also work it down over a six-month, seven-month time period. We've been working on it for the last couple months. Clearly, the orders have been weaker here in the last several months, which creates a situation where we have to lower that water even further. So we do it very systematically. We don't try to shock it. That's dangerous. Gautam J. Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then just another follow-up. In your monthly orders that you give us, have you had any major de-bookings in Process or Industrial Automation or elsewhere and that has kind of amplified the negativity in the numbers? Or has that not really been the big part of the story yet? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. It's not that big. It's not that big. We've not had anything to drive that big time. If we did, we would let you know. Gautam J. Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: (53:48) Gautam J. Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: And just lastly, seasonality, normally fiscal Q4, we get a nice little plus up in margins in Process and elsewhere. I mean given what's going on real-time in the markets, what kind of bounce are you expecting sequentially if at all? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We are expecting profitability to bounce positively in the fourth quarter for various reasons. One, restructuring. We've now got $90 million done in the last 2.5 quarters. And we're starting to see a payback of that. And so, we're seeing that, and also, the typical type of mix of business where the business comes from. So we see sequentially we have a good improvement in our sales and we are going to see a bounce back in the fourth quarter. Gautam J. Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys, and good luck. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Afternoon, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, John. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: What is your sense of Middle East being able to continue to be resilient in the face of oil prices? And it seems to be a lot of I guess politics and employment issues, right, that are sort of continuing to drive these projects, and it's obviously been a source of strength for you and other companies. But I think it's \u2013 does it continue to hold in, like is there \u2013 is that \u2013 should we just sort of think of it as a placeholder? What's your sense? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I wouldn't \u2013 I call nothing a placeholder, but... John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Well, relative placeholder. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: ...yeah. Okay, John. I think you're exactly right. They have the issue they have to produce oil, they have to maintain that's what their income is. So they're going to have to produce more oil. They're going to need to invest to produce more oil, and they're investing for other jobs across a diverse group. So we've seen, not every business, but certain businesses have done reasonably well in the Middle East. I mean on the data center business side and what I call non-res construction type of business side, it's been very poor, but on the Process side, it's been pretty good; in the Climate side, it's been pretty good. So right now, it's holding up, and the order pace is holding up. So right now, I'd say we're going to see moderate growth again in 2016 as of right now, based on what I've been seeing from an order pace... John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: ...which is surprising to me. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Can I switch gears to Network Power here? I'm wondering do you think there's an issue perhaps that would be fleeting or temporary, but one perhaps nonetheless that maybe there is some distraction costs going on, post the announcement you're going to spin the business. And I'm wondering with this (56:22), I'm thinking in the olden days certainly, India, China, employees were just sort of habitual, but employees would bounce around company to company. A lot of companies had very high turnover. Just wondering post the announcement if perhaps there've been some worker, kind of extra worker losses unplanned at the managerial level or whatnot, that maybe... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: ...could be exacerbating temporarily the Network Power results in China or elsewhere? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No John, it's been actually opposite. It's been very positive, people are very happy about it. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: So again, it's a positive note. They've had a tough couple of years here and it's got hit again really with the telecom spend both here in the U.S. and in China, and the enterprise spend in China. So they just got hit again, but within the organization, it's been well received. And maybe it's strong for us right now. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. I mean so there's not really much that you can do about the markets for that business. It sounds almost like that there is hypothetically further deterioration, you're just going to go ahead with the spin anyway. So in other words, analysts and investors, there's nothing that fundamentally is likely to detract you from the plan to strategically spin the business or... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Nothing. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: ...are there other things we should consider about? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I don't see anything stopping us right now. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeremie Capron with CLSA. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Following up on restructuring, most of it seems to be happening right now and you just said that it would continue into the December quarter. Do you expect restructuring to continue at a similar pace in the first half of next year? How should we think about the total cost that you're taking out of the business between February of this year and the midpoint of next year? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You mean total, I'm still holding to around that $225 million to $240 million from the February at the beginning \u2013 when we started this process to its finish, it's going to be in that $225 million to $240 million range. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. So basically, we're looking at another $70 million into next year? Is that right? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We'll see. We'll see what we have come down the pike here, what kind of the pace of the business is, but when all said and done, we did $90 million in the first three quarters. Let's say, we do another $90 million in the fourth quarter. That's $180 million. I'm looking somewhere between $40 million and $60 million probably next year. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. Thanks. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Does that work for you? Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Yeah, yeah, absolutely. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. Good. I didn't have a calculator. I used a piece of paper and a pen on that one. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Well, that works well too. I'm a little bit surprised to see negative mix across your five divisions. Is that anything to do with price more than mix? And then if you could comment on the overall price level, how much of a drop in price you've seen so far this year? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, from the standpoint we don't measure price that accurate, I would say the general price trend is slightly negative across the whole company. We didn't offset that from our cost reduction, not material inflation. I would expect we'll have negative price \u2013 slightly negative again next year. What we've been seeing is mix within the businesses, some of our more profitable businesses are having a tough quarter, like Process. And so, we have this unfortunate situation where right now, we have a lot of businesses trending down quite hard which are the more profitable businesses. And sometimes that helps us and sometimes that hurts us, and right now, it's hurting us. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. And when you look at your order intake, any shift in terms of pricing here happening over the last few months or just a similar slightly downward bias? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's \u2013 from my perspective, right now, the pricing is obviously getting tougher every month. Particularly with the euro where it is at $1.10 and the yen where it is, but it's not noticeably much different. I think we're going to have the same issue as we go into 2016, too. That's why our costs, our work on the material containment stuff is very, very important to us. We're going to need that because we know the pricing environment is not going to be easy unless we see the dollar start weakening which I see no indication the dollar's going to start weakening. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. Well, good luck with that. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much. Appreciate it. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: With that, I want to thank everybody. Again, it clearly was an extremely challenging quarter and not pleasing to see. We are facing another extremely challenging quarter again, probably for the next two quarters. The organization is very much focused on getting our costs and our production down in line relative to the pace of business we're seeing right now and we're making good headway. And we would expect to see improvement in profitability here in the fourth quarter which will give us \u2013 set us well as we move into that first quarter. So thank you very much for your time today and I appreciate your support. Bye. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference call. We appreciate your participation.",

(Broker) Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : Good day ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Emerson's Investor Conference Call. During today's presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. This conference is being recorded today, November 3, 2015. Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most and recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Craig Rossman, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead, sir. Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you, Caroline. Today I'm joined by Dave Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available Emerson's website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will available on the website for the next 90 days. I will start with the fourth quarter and fiscal year summary on page two of the slide presentation. Net sales in the quarter decreased 15% to $5.8 billion with underlying sales down 7%. Net sales for the fiscal year decreased 9% to $22.3 billion with underlying sales down 2%. Both the quarter and the year were significantly affected by number of economic headwinds. The continuation of lower oil prices resulted in both capital and more recently operational spending reductions by our global oil and gas customers. General industrial capital spending was slow throughout the year, particularly in energy related markets. Emerging market growth was sluggish with weakening conditions as we exited fiscal 2015. In response to the weakening demand, we accelerated our restructuring programs in the fourth quarter with a total spend of $128 million, which exceeded our August conference call guidance by just over $40 million or an impact of approximately $0.04 cents per share. For the fiscal year total restructuring expense was $221 million. During the quarter we also incurred $52 million of costs and taxes related to the spinoff of Network Power, $10 million for transaction costs and $42 million of income tax expense for planned repatriation of earnings in 2016. On September 30, we announced the completion of the divestiture of the InterMetro business resulting in a gain for our shareholders. Reported earnings per share for the fourth quarter increased 69% to $0.98. Earnings per share adjusted for the divestiture gains and Network Power spinoff costs decreased 29% to $0.93. Reported earnings per share for the fiscal year increased 32% to $3.99 while adjusted earnings per share decreased 15% to $3.17. During the fiscal year, the company returned $3.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. Turning to slide three, gross profit margin in the quarter decreased 170 basis points to 40.7%, primarily due to volume deleverage and unfavorable business and product mix. EBIT margin reflects the impacts of the accelerated restructuring, the Network Power spinoff costs, and benefit of divestiture gains. Fourth quarter margins were up 270 basis points on a sequential basis versus third quarter EBIT margin of 15.2%. During the quarter, approximately 9 million shares were repurchased for $460 million. Turning to slide four, global demand was mixed during the fiscal year with underlying sales in the Middle East and Africa up 3%, Canada up 2%, the US down 2%, Europe flat and Asia down 5%. Turning to slide five, business segment margin declined 450 basis points to 15.7%, primarily due to volume deleverage, unfavorable mix and increased restructuring expenses. Operating cash flow reflected solid conversion of earnings and working capital. Turning to slide six, Process Management underlying sales declined 10% in the quarter. Capital and operational spending remained at reduced levels within the oil and gas industry. Upstream markets are under the most pressure while downstream activity in chemical and power markets continue to provide growth opportunities. The Middle East, Africa region grew 2% with mixed but generally favorable activity levels across the region. Accelerated restructuring activities resulted in spending of $52 million in the quarter, an impact of 230 basis points. Demand will remain under pressure for most of the fiscal 2016 as the expectation for lower for longer oil prices will keep industry spending at reduced levels. Turning to slide seven, Industrial Automation fourth quarter underlying sales declined 12% reflecting the continued weakness in industrial spending, upstream oil and gas markets and European demand. Demand was down in all regions with North America down 20%, Europe down 2%, and Asia down 8%. We will continue to evaluate the potential divestitures of the motors and drives and power generation businesses during fiscal 2016. Market conditions will remain challenging in the near term with an expectation of improvement in the second half of the fiscal year. Turning to slide eight. Network Power underlying sales declined 4% in the quarter as global demand for data center infrastructure and telecommunications investment remained mix. Within the geographies, Europe was up 10% while North America was down 10%. Asia was down 5% as strong growth in India and Australia was more than offset by demand weakness in China. Accelerated restructuring activities resulted in spending of $33 million in the quarter. We continue to expect the spinoff of Network Power to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2016. Turning to slide nine. Climate Technologies' fourth quarter underlying sales were down 5%. North America was down 3% as our results were impacted by challenging year-over-year comparisons stemming from the US residential air conditioning industry pre-build in 2014. Asia was down 10% as slowing demand in China more than offset growth in other regions. Segment margin increased 10 basis points, primarily supported by cost reductions and favorable materials cost containment which more than offset increased restructuring expenses of $12 million. We expect modest growth for the Climate Technologies segment next fiscal year as global demand in the air conditioning and refrigeration markets is expected to remain favorable in 2016. Turning to slide 10. Commercial & Residential Solutions' fourth quarter underlying sales were up 3%, benefiting from favorable trends in US construction. Growth in food waste disposers and wet dry vacuums was substantially offset by a decline in the professional tools business which continues to reflect spending reductions in energy related markets. Segment margins were down 100 basis points but up 10 basis points when excluding the impact from the increased restructuring expense. The favorable trends in US construction markets are expected to continue, supporting our outlook for moderate levels of growth and profit improvement in 2016. Turning to slide 11. We expect difficult market conditions to remain in effect through at least the first six to nine months of fiscal 2016. The continuation of the headwinds faced in our key served markets during 2015 will reduce underlying sales growth across our businesses, resulting in an expectation that net sales will decline 6% to 8% in 2016. Underlying sales are expected to be down approximately 2% to 5% excluding negative currency translation and a deduction from completed divestitures of approximately 2% each. As previously discussed, the sales in the first quarter will be challenging when considering current market conditions and difficult comparisons to the prior year. We expect first quarter underlying sales to be down approximately 10%, excluding negative currency and divestitures of approximately 6% in total. Cost structure alignment and the strategic portfolio repositioning will remain a key focus for Emerson in fiscal 2016 where structuring expenses of $50 million to $70 million are expected in 2016 with most of the activity occurring during the first half of the fiscal year. We also estimate that we would incur expenses of approximately $300 million to $400 million related to the spinoff of Network Power and the potential divestitures of the motors and drives and power generation businesses. The level of activity surrounding the evaluation of an acquisition of key strategic assets will also increase next year. For EPS guidance, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be $3.05 to $3.25 when excluding the portfolio repositioning costs. Finally, in support of our commitment to returning cash to Emerson shareholders, the Board of Directors has approved an increase to the first quarter dividend to an annualized rate of $1.90 per share and a new program authorizing the repurchase of 70 million shares. And now I'll turn it over to Mr. David Farr. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much, Craig. Welcome everybody this afternoon. And Frank, thanks for joining us today. Glad to be with you and glad to get this fiscal year behind us. It's been a very challenging year. And as we know, we are in a global industry recession for our businesses right now. We just incurred our third negative underlying sales growth and we will have two more, and I'll talk a little bit about that. I want to thank all the global corporate and business teams for their support and efforts throughout this year as we dealt with a year that started out very strong with underlying sales growth in the first quarter of over 5%, to immediately going into an extremely tough marketplace throughout the year. Restructuring efforts, the cost savings, the announced sale of two businesses getting done in one year, the announce of our repositioning with Network Power being spin or sold and/or the sale of Leroy-Somer CT this year. A lot going on. As I look at the effort and the performance the last several months, we're starting to see the stabilization of some of the markets. We're also seeing the benefits of the restructuring, which we started back in February aggressively and ended up spending over $221 million as the year got more challenging, we're starting to see the benefits flow through. We had a fourth quarter of over 20% operating margin in a very difficult year with a lot of down sales and a lot of challenging currency and price costs. As I look forward here, I see the underlying order pace running around this 10%, 11% negative probably for the next several months. As Craig highlighted, I firmly believe as we've talked about for several conference calls now, a very challenging first quarter. We had a very good first quarter last year with strong topline growth, strong margin and strong cash flow and strong earnings per share. This year we'll be facing negative, probably negative 10% underlying sales growth, with negative 7% currency and divestiture impact, with a lot of issues around that because of the price costs, because of the global trends and all the issues. And I firmly believe a lot of other companies are starting to struggle, and the question will be how much they will do in the month of December. But we're ready for it. We've been getting ready for this tough time period for the several months now. The restructuring is really starting to take hold. We have about $60 million to $70 million more restructuring to get done that will benefit 2016. It will be front-end loaded. It's worked extremely hard program by program. We will get it done in the first five or six months, and we're ready for what I would say, the first negative quarter and then the second negative quarter, which I believe underlying sales could be down somewhere in the 5% to 6% range. And then we'll start coming out of this both from an easy comparison but also seeing some stability in the markets we serve. So right now, in the industrial recession that Emerson faces, we will have down five quarters. We will then have the restructuring kick in, really starting to improve our profitability as we get into the second and third and fourth quarters, then we'll start seeing the improvements of the global markets we serve. We will continue to drive hard to get the spin or the sale of Network Power done within the fiscal year of 2016. We will continue to drive hard to finish the divestiture on Leroy-Somer CT in the fiscal year, and then we'll come out of 2016 with a very strong core business churning up with very high levels of profitability. Again, a lot of work across this organization to deal with the challenging economic environment we've been facing, and I'm very pleased to see the work done. I'm very pleased to see the effort relative to the cash flow and the balance sheet. And the balance sheet will be, what I would say, in acceptable condition. It's strong today, but even better when we get into the second quarter as we continue to manage the balance sheet and get what I would say a little bit extra working capital built up in that balance sheet from the past downturn. But we are transacting very hard right now in this tough environment. The organization is focused on generating the earnings and the cash we need and repositioning this company to have a strong case of growth when the economic recovery happens. In the meantime, acquisitions, we're very strongly focused on the two core markets and the opportunities, working those acquisition opportunities the best we can, and we're underway to hopefully consummate several acquisitions throughout 2016 as the opportunities come about. But we're going to be facing a challenging next six months. We know that. The business leaders know that. The board knows that, and we're taking the actions necessary to protect the company overall from a technology and profitability standpoint and the financial capability and positioning ourself for a strong underlying growth recovery and a strong acquisition tuck recovery once the repositioning effort is underway. We chose to increase the dividend slightly this year. We have the cash flow. As you look at the new business, or the new Emerson when we come out in late 2016, early 2017, the cash flow generation of the company is very strong and we can support the dividend at the same time supporting any acquisitions or share repurchase necessary. So right now, we're very focused on getting through this time period of the next six months, getting the nose back up and getting the company positioned to recover strongly for our shareholders both the top line, profitability and cash flow. But the same time, yes, we had a very difficult year last year. Yes, our underlying sales were down over 2%. Yes, our reported sales were down 9%. But we did generate nearly $3 billion of operating cash flow when you adjust for the extra taxes we paid for the divestitures, and we generated over 17% operating profit margin in a very challenging environment. And our goal is to again generate that same 17% as we go into another down year in 2016. The environment is what the environment is. We deal with it. But we're going to try to control what we can control, and we're going to control our profitability, our cash flow, our returns and any acquisitions we can get done. And we will get the spin/sale done if necessary as quickly as possible, and we'll get the sale of CTE \u2013 Leroy-Somer done as quickly as possible. That's where we sit today, and I want to thank the global organization for what they've done and where we're positioned. We'll give you a better insight around the segments as we get into our discussion in February, which I believe is in Austin, Texas. I mean there's no snow in Austin, Texas. Maybe a little rain, but not typically in February. So hopefully I will see a lot of shareholders down in Austin, Texas, so they can see the core process business we have down there and explain to you what we're going to do as we come out of this industrial recession we've been facing here for the last several quarters and will face for the next two quarters. With that, I'll open the line to take some calls. And I appreciate everyone's support and engagement as we go forward here in the coming months and year. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go first to Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good afternoon. Just a question on the notion of organic sales maybe turning back up again in the June quarter of next year. As you said, that's after five quarters of decline, so are you just kind of taking the template of prior downturns that lasted around that long and applying it this time? Or are you seeing something specific in the orders in either energy or broad emerging markets that you think support that improvement? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: First of all, we look at the pace of how fast we came down. We look at historical trend lines. At that point in time, I see nothing that early that far out relative to the pace. It's just, I look at what we've gone through, through some difficult economic downturns over the years. Sometimes it's four, sometimes it's five. The more challenging ones typically are five. I am not assuming there is a global recession. I'm assuming the global environment is very similar to what we're facing today, challenging, in certain markets doing okay, certain markets not doing okay. But we get to a point that you get low enough and our pace of business and the type of marketplace we serve, they will start investing in certain space again. So that's where I come from, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. And then just around Network Power, the clean profits, stripping out restructuring, I think were still down about 40% for 2015 as a whole, down 30% something exiting the year. So I just wondered how that plays into the spin decision and at what point you think we might start to see the earnings in Network Power stabilize. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: From the standpoint of spin, I think what's unfolding in Network Power is still within what we planned. When we look at 2016, it's still well within its plan. So we can either spin or we can look at a potential strategic sale. From my perspective, as I look at the pace of orders and what's going on right now, we're starting to see some stability. And I would expect to see that nose turning up as we get into the early 2016 calendar year based on what we're seeing trend line from these guys at this point in time. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. And just a very quick follow up. Any color on the price net of raw materials impact on margin in 2016? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean, the price cost, it's pretty neutral at this point in time. My gut tells me it'll probably potentially be a negative, what I call red as we get into 2016. It's always a function of pricing pressures and the currency trends we see in the net material inflation. But right now, it's pretty close to being neutral. But, I guess I would say this year probably could end up being slightly negative as we get into 2016 just based on what I see out there from a competitive standpoint. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's something we can manage, to be honest. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yes. Thanks. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you. Operator : And next we'll go to Johnny Wright with Nomura. Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Good afternoon, guys. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Hi, Johnny. Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hi. So maybe just kind of following up on that question on the inflection second half of the year. Looking at the slides, you talked about expectation of improvement in Industrial Automation. What gives you confidence on that sitting here today? And what really are the key risks to that kind of coming through in 2016? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's really a function around how much people cut back spending for the last 18 months, and looking at the trend lines in the customer base, and looking at some of those reinvestments that will start happening. People are not going to keep \u2013 they're going to eventually have to reinvest some money. And we do have a pretty good installed base out there. So that's where it comes from. And we're not talking about a very strong recovery. I mean, after you go down for three tough quarters, after we go down 10% this quarter, after we go down 6% the next quarter, it's not unusual to see historically a company like Emerson, who's globally well established with installed base quite significant, to have a little bit of recovery coming in that sixth type of quarter. So I mean, I'm not looking at anything unusual from a marketplace standpoint. And we're again, I'll say, we are expecting the economics environment around the world to be slightly weaker or about the same as we are facing right now. So the risk would be if we truly went into a global broad recession, then you clearly say okay, the industrial space will be a little bit weaker than I'm thinking. But I don't see any indication we're going to go to a global broad recession at this point in time. Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay, great. And then on Process Management, the margin front for next year, clearly a lot of restructuring had been focused there. You've got a tailwind from that. Can you just maybe talk about some of the other dynamics, particularly out on the pricing front and where you're going to be seeing margins coming out next year for Process? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You know, from my perspective, the restructuring underway and the work that Steve Sonnenberg and his whole team have done has been extremely good. And we will have clearly I would say the most negative pricing environment we've seen from those guys in a long time. However, we do have our unique installed base part, so basically our day-to-day MRO, small project business will help us there. So with the restructuring effort underway, we expect our margins to be trending upward in Process based obviously after a shocker this year with the restructuring, but we expect our margins to move back up on a comparison basis versus this year. Even with down sales, because the effort, the restructuring, the effort that these guys have undertaken to get the costs out and assuming a negative price environment, which we are assuming with Process, we're expecting our underlying profitability this improve next year in Process Management obviously relative to this year, but at pretty high levels relative to historical levels. Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Sure. And when you say that, are you talking about in terms of reported margins, so including the restructuring in both years? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes, exactly. Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You see, the Process Management team, if you look at the restructuring they got done this year, they got a lot of restructuring done this year, and they have some left in the $60 million or $70 million next year. But they have got the big part of it behind as of right now, which is a good position to be in. So what was the total restructuring for Process, Craig, this, for the year? What did they do? You got the chart there. Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.: I have to pull it out in front of me. Sorry. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: (24:26) David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Rossman, you already gave us those speeches, have a beer. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: He's tracking down lunch, have a beer. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean and then Farr hits him with questions. Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.: $90 million. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: $90 million. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: $90 million, so they got $90 million done. They've got a lot of restructuring done this year, and so of the $221 million, they got $90 million. So I think they are in good shape going into next year. It's going to be a very difficult first half for Process. They had a very strong first quarter, but I really feel good about what they've got accomplished from the restructuring standpoint and the costs taken out. Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Great. Thanks for your time, guys. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : And next we'll go to John Inch with Deutsche Bank. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon, Dave, Craig. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, John. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon. So I wanted to start with you expect $250 million of savings from actions that you took in 2015, which was $221 million. How do you get more restructuring benefit than what you actually spent? I'm not suggesting you won't, I just want to understand how that's going to work. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Depends on the costs you take out and what type of programs, type of cost layers you take out. I mean, we went in pretty hard to get overhead costs out and some redundancy costs out and we typically get a good payback for that. So we went after it. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: David, this restructuring, do you think it can hold? Like in other words it's a little bit of a question of say the mix of variable adjustment versus structural and how \u2013 do you have to give some back to the customer? Does some creep back as the business trends better? Maybe you could just help us peel the onion a little bit in terms of what you've done, because it was obviously very aggressive in the quarter. So just trying to understand. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's been aggressive the whole year. We just didn't do it all last month. I know people think that, but it's actually worked its way through and a lot of it's been planned for since starting in February. I mean, I'm not going to go back and tell you exactly what we did. It's clearly that's what I would call our own information. We did spend the money. We will get the savings built into it, and there will not be a creep. We have built into plans. We know the pricing will be tough in certain marketplaces next year, but that's why we're working the restructuring as hard as we've done. It will stick, and from a standpoint of profitability, we generate very high levels of profitability. And I'll say it again. Despite a very challenging year in 2015, we did generate 17.3% operating profit on down sales, and we're planning on trying to generate 17% of operating profit next year on down sales. So we know what we're trying to do here relative to profitability, John. So this is one I'm not going to give you any more details. You've got to trust me. We know how to manage our cost structure at Emerson. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Maybe just lastly, Dave, can I ask you, post the spin of Network Power, so I realize you've also made comments that you're looking to pick up the pace of M&A a little bit. But in theory, right, post the spin of Network Power, then Emerson's a smaller footprint. Do you modify then the dividend accordingly? So you say, well we're now 4/5 of what we were, so we'll modify the dividend in some manner by that? It's not really a leading question to be negative, it's more just trying to understand how this is going to work with respect to your dividend, because the dividend's very important. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I've been very clear on this. We will not be reducing our dividend. The new company, the new Emerson that comes out when it comes out in 2017, let's say it's around $15.5 billion in size with margins of over 19%, margins generate very good levels of cash flow, more than enough cash flow to justify the current dividend payment and continue to increase the dividend and doing share repurchase and doing acquisitions. So the business that stays behind is a very strong operating performing return company that can generate enough earnings and enough cash to pay the dividend as we're structured right now. We are not going to be adjusting our dividend payout for the new Emerson. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thanks much. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome, John. Operator : And next we'll go to Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks, and good afternoon guys. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Steve. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, Dave, what are the actual underlying GFI growth rates then that are embedded in your guidance for 2016? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: On the global G7 basis, I'm embedding around 2.5% basis growth. This year is around 2%, 2.1%, we're in slightly improvement and a global basis. So it's slightly \u2013 about the same on the GFI. This is the G7, the bigger markets, so that's what we're looking at. If you look at the overall forecast out there, it's much higher than that right now and I don't believe it at all. I think we're going to be trending in this low 2%s. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Right, and then \u2013 but you still have that picking up during the pace of next year, right? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, as you go into the first half of the year, you're probably looking at what we've been seeing the last six months, in the low 2%s, around the 2.2%, 2.3%, and then I think you then start moving that up in the little bit higher 2%s in the second half of the year as people start turning back into \u2013 they've got the stability. They've got the restructuring. They've got the needs they need to start investing in. So I'm not looking for a big sudden spike but I'm looking that to start trending up toward the mid to higher 2%s. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And you talked about - David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: By the way, that's not what the economic forecast is, as you know. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes, that's why I'm asking you and not a bunch of economists. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I am a dumb unliked CEO so what the hell are you asking me for? Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So you mentioned increased activity in evaluating the acquisition of key strategic assets. You talked about consummating several for 2016. Where is your head and current thinking in terms of the size and directionality in Process and Industrial versus Commercial & Resi? So what kind of expectations should we have on what these things look like? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Most of them are going to be \u2013 right now what we're pushing pretty hard are what I would call more of a private type of companies out there. I really would like to consummate, even though we're talking only about \u2013 I'd really like to consummate over $0.5 billion within the industrial process, industrial automation area, and I'd like to consummate maybe $100 million, $150 million over on the Commercial & Residential area as I look at 2016. These are actions that we're going out and encouragingly, we've been talking to private shareholders and companies that we've been courting for some time, and given the tougher marketplace right now, they are much more receptive to it. At this point, I do not see any big strategic, say public type of transaction underway, but we're going to keep working the knits around the corners. And particularly, I'm going to start working pretty hard in Asia, too, because I think Asia's got some opportunities that, with their markets being stressed right now, that we want to go after, too. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: ]>: Okay. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: So we've got the businesses working real hard. Primarily I would say 90% of the money will end up in the industrial asset base over the process world. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great, and one more thing. I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but just given your commentary in this call and you talked about basically 20% year-on-year decline which is more \u2013 higher sequential than the usual amount and decrementals, I'm assuming of about 30%, and then you've got the restructuring offset. I mean it sounds to me like we certainly, in the tough comps, certainly should be having a number down here well less than $0.45 to $0.50. But just directionally? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I would directionally, I'd be more around the $0.50 range. I mean last year we reported $0.75, the year before that we reported $0.65. Our sales, I mean if you think about 2014, coming off that 2014, where we had $5.6 billion in sales and we had a OP margin around 14% and then $0.65 EPS, we're going to be about $1 billion below that in sales, but we've got restructuring underway and helping us. So I think we'll get pretty good flow through. I would be thinking around a $0.50 number for that first quarter. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, guys. Thanks. Good luck. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Now I'm doing that one time, that's it. I'm not giving quarters out. Operator : And our next question will come from Mike Wood with Macquarie Securities Group. Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi. Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: How you doing, Mike? Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: I applaud the aggressive restructuring actions. Just a question first on Process. You mentioned downstream providing growth opportunities. Curious if you're seeing growth there, and if you can give some color in terms of what subsectors are growing on the downstream side. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean, what we're seeing is continuing the investments going on in some of the petrochemical areas, the chemical areas, some of the pharmaceutical areas, sort of the areas that people are making those investments using the lower cost of energy both on the oil side and the gas side. We've been seeing the proxies go through. They're not as large as we thought originally, but they're still going forward. And I don't see people backing off on that. I mean, the projects that Sasol has underway going down in Louisiana, which is a big customer base for us, that's moving forward. So the opportunities are out there. And I anticipate as we get into the spring and early summer of 2016, some of the companies that have been cutting back on capital and cutting back on, what I would say, necessary investments are going to have to let the money go. I mean, they've got other costs adjusted. So I think that our underlying MRO, which is a good business for us, will improve and get better as we get into 2016. So, it's not totally dead out there. The big oil and gas projects obviously are struggling. But the other investments around the chemical and petrochemical are still happening for us. Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And you mentioned the restructuring. I may have missed this. Did you quantify how much you do in the first half of next year? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We're going to do, let's say we're going to do $60 million to $70 million. I think what, Frank, we're going to do 60% of it? Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: About 60% to 70% of it in the first half, yeah. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: 70% in the first half. Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thanks, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Operator : And next we'll to Scott Davis with Barclays. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Scott. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I'm trying to get a sense, I was in China a few weeks ago and I walked back pretty darn embarrassed. And it seems like there's some sequential slowdowns there. And if you look at your numbers, it shows exactly what we saw. And do you have any sense of, I guess a couple things (35:12-35:16) as much of an inventory destock as anything else? Or are things sequentially getting worse there and that concerns you as you go into 2016? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Well, we are planning for a down 2016 in China. From my perspective, we've had two very challenging quarters. I fundamentally believe there has been a destocking going on. Basically what we can tell, Scott, right now I think the worst of that is behind us. I do believe we will have a challenging first quarter because we had a very good first quarter last year. So I mean it's probably going to be strong double digits down in sales. But I personally don't think it's getting worse. I think that they are trying to reposition. And I expect that we will have a down year next year. But we'll manage our way through it, get a little bit better as we go forward as they start reprioritizing their investments. But right now, I mean we had a down 18% in the fourth quarter. We're probably going to be down around 15% again in the second quarter, or the first quarter. And I think we'll probably be down around 10% in that second quarter, and then we'll start getting better as we go forward. But we're going to be down somewhere around 3%, 4%, 5% for the whole year in China. So it is going to be a tough year. I'm not looking for any sharp bounce back there. I agree with you. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And just as a follow up, I mean, is that the region? I mean, you cited some price risk versus raws next year. I mean, is that the region where you are the most concerned about excess capacity and price? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I'm not concerned about that is much there. My price risk comes into play in the large global projects where monies are being spent. There are projects being done out there. And clearly the pricing risks will come in on those projects. And you clearly are trying to protect your customer base. You're trying to protect something. So that's where I would see the pricing pressures on the industrial side. On the commercial side, the Commercial & Residential, I would say Asia would give me the most price pressures. But I also typically have the most cost opportunities there too. So my price pressures, I don't worry about China next year as much as I worry about the big global projects. There are not that many out there, and people are going to be hungry fighting for those projects. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Good color. Good luck, guys. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Take care, Scott. All the best to you. Operator : And next we'll go to Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. David, to follow up on that last comment you made, have you seen any of this price pressure yet in the orders you have been recording? Or is that something that's still on the comp? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We see it today, and we have continued to see it. You know, our net material inflation has clearly been helping us from an ops (38:01) standpoint, because the inflation environment we've been feeling for the last three years has been negative on materials, so that's helped us. But at the same time, I've had three years of what I would call it, negative price. I think that the pricing pressures has already happen on the bidding. Our customer base knows that the global marketplace is a challenge. They know that commodity prices have come down and they are utilizing that. And obviously, we work that very hard. We're aware of that. And for my cost structure standpoint, and we've been able to make that up, but I would say we will probably have in the end, when we add up all the numbers next year, my gut tells me we have a slightly negative net price material inflation to hit us a little bit. Not big, but slightly. I just think it's going to be there as we all work this issue for the next six months or seven months to get through this transition. So it's there, and I'm openly talking about it, and it's happening, so that's what's going on. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And then you already addressed the China question, but I was just curious, elsewhere are there any regions where you're actually worried about another leg down, a more significant step down in demand where things could get substantially worse? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: The only place I see right now on the markets is we're already seeing the impact in Eastern Europe and Russia. We've already seen that. I'm a little bit worried in the Middle East as our big Middle Eastern customers both in oil and gas and petrochemical investments, if they cut back even more to protect their cash flow for various reasons, whatever they need the money for. So I would say that market for us, you're talking about a $1 billion marketplace, I would say that has the biggest risk at this point in time. I think we've taken a big hit in Latin America and Brazil, Mexico. I still think that will be negative next year, but I think we've taken a big hit. My concern is the Middle East. I think there's a risk for a bigger down than we're planning. We're planning it down, but I think it could be a bigger one. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. And one last one. At Climate Tech, do you expect to start to comp positively as early as the March quarter as you lap this year 2014 pre-build? Or when do expect that business to start to see positive? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I would expect the comps to turn positive in the second quarter. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We watch our customer base report, and we know they are working through that inventory. They have done a great job of managing that inventory, and getting it out and getting the sales. So I would say we'll have a negative first quarter, and then we'll start comping more favorable in that second quarter. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Take care. Have a good afternoon. Operator : And next we will go to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon, Dave. So you mentioned something very interesting. I think when you mentioned that the bulk of the channel destock is behind you, I think you were talking about China specifically. Could you maybe just broaden that out in terms of what you're seeing globally on inventory destock and when you think that might be behind you? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: My inventories in Europe are \u2013 I look at our channel and it's pretty good. Because of the channel partners and the channel you sell into, money was hard to come by so the European channel's in pretty good shape. I look at my channel in North America, I would say it's in decent shape right now in the businesses we sell into. The last piece of this working through would be the climate areas is all the pre-build we have there. But I would say the channel is in decent shape. Probably as we get through this calendar year, it will be in really good shape. And so we saw the inventories being built and people anticipated the second half being stronger. We saw the destocking happen this quarter. I think the plan in, we have built into our plan for this quarter where underlying sales might be down say 10%. I think that will work its way through it on the destock from my perspective, as I see the channels. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So as we get into calendar 2016, that should be behind us? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes, I would say yes, unless you had a step down and overall a recessionary environment. Right now, I think people are planning for very, very, very low growth and they're getting their inventories down and they're working it very hard. It's the same thing we've been doing as a company here. I'd say we have one more quarter basically of getting our inventories down, and then typically we're no different than the global distribution channel anyway. So I think that's exactly right. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Very helpful. And then just in a similar vein, Dave, clearly the MRO spending is still pretty tight with the oil and gas companies. Any sense on when we might start to see some of that action coming through? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I don't think you'll see any action in that space until the second half of calendar year 2016. That's why I think Process will be down in growth next year. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Operator : And our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, Dave, just a follow up on the Climate. So in terms of it returning to growth, when you get past the SEER comps, which make sense, but China was down 27% Climate. I mean, is that going to be an offset to that, or can you explain a little bit what you're seeing in Climate in China right now? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Well, Climate had a very strong first half of the year in China as they built inventory up in the channel, going back to one of the previous questions. And they're quickly taking it out right now. So I think what will happen is the typical plan in China is they over-build, they take it back down, and then they'll start building back up again. So I would expect that China would start seeing some improved second half numbers, most likely still negative for the first two or three quarters, and then getting up and positive in that fourth quarter. So the destocking is still underway. I think the major destocking will be done by the end of that first quarter in China. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then just obviously the pressure is significant now just sort of across the business and a lot of restructuring to do. But typically when times are difficult like this, Emerson likes to invest and take share and come out of the downturn even stronger. I mean is that happening, or are there examples you would give sort of across the portfolio where you feel like you're playing offense even though there's obviously a lot of restructuring to do as well? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We are continuing to play offense. I will share a lot with you in February on this issue. We are not cutting back in certain strategic areas where we think we have unique opportunities to gain share. So yes, we are restructuring, but we're restructuring in an area and areas that we feel that are not strategic relative to gaining that growth opportunities. And so we're continuing to invest and restructure Emerson. Very good at this gas pedal and brake at the same time. And so we're playing that game because what we want to do is come out of this and continue to grow our core markets in particular on the two strategic businesses we're going to have when we finish this in 2016. So the board has been keenly interested and tuned to what you're saying there. They do not want us to get to the point that we're cutting really strategic growth opportunities and opportunities we see out there. So we're working it very hard. We'll share some ideas with you in February. But suffice it to say that our game plan is get the costs down, which we are right now very quickly, and then take advantage of those opportunities when they come back at us. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much. Operator : And next we'll go to Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good afternoon, Dave. How are you doing? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Bob. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, so I guess the first question I'd have is with respect to kind of monthly order trends. And obviously, you're not disclosing those anymore but you're still tracking them. Could you speak to what kind of month you would see as kind of critical to think about whether we would see the kind of growth that you're talking about for the plan for 2016 versus potentially something worse? In other words, when does that comp kind of appear in terms of the backlog, in terms of the order trends where you can declare victory or think about something incrementally worse? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. First of all, we will continue to disclose our orders once a quarter, and so the next time where we disclose will be in? Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.: December. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: December. So we will be putting orders out there. This month-to-month stuff, given that we're the only one doing it, it was kind of crazy. We will disclose it in December, and then we'll true them up in February when we report the quarter. So you'll still get access to them. But what I'm looking at as I map out the year, I just unloaded, or unfolded for you all on the phone earlier is what I expect is that we should see on a comp basis, in order for us to have second half underlying sales growth, I have to see my order pace start getting above that line, across that line, the zero line as we get out of that second quarter. So when we report orders in the end of, let's say the March quarter, the March timeframe, you should start seeing that number approaching that 0% range. And if not, and if it's still negative 5% or 6% then we'll go back to the conversation I had earlier that we will not see the positive recovery in that third quarter, and then we'll have a sixth down underlying sales quarter. So that's the benchmark you need to look at. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Understood. And then just moving to Process Management and just given what you've seen \u2013 this has been picked over a little bit \u2013 but given what you've seen about what you expect in terms of behavior across the board in terms of potential cuts, and you mentioned the Middle East as a potential negative there, do you feel like you have a good sense that we're going to see a bottom here and the implications for margins here? In other words what is baked into your current plan? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think right now we expect the market we see today is going to continue to be weak in front of us for at least two quarters. That's what's baked into our plan. And then some stability, and we will have down underlying sales in the year of 2016. The restructuring effort is based on down underlying sales. I believe I've talked about down 3%, 4%, 5% with process underlying sales. And so we baked in that type of down, say down 5% underlying sales, into the cost expectations in trying to get the restructuring done so we can try to deliver improved profitability in 2016 and continue to make the strategic investments we need to make. So I expect Process to be facing some pretty challenging headwinds for the next couple quarters. We will start seeing, as I get out in February or I get in January and talking to various investors, I'll be able to start seeing some of the early parts of process on the MRO, the instrumentation side. If I start seeing that improve, that will give me a good feeling that we've reached that bottom and we have a clear visibility to that second half as we leave 2016. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: The final question real quick is just in terms of the Network Power, in terms of this parallel process, I mean obviously there's limits as to what you could say about it. But I guess how do you think about the decision around price, timing, etc. versus going the spin route versus a potential sale to a strategic. I mean what are kind of the qualitative factors that you are stressing? Is it speed in terms of exit or is it valuation? How should we think about it? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: From my perspective \u2013 I have one perspective. It's called valuation, producer responsibility to my shareholders. Maximize the value for my shareholders as I look at, and the board looks at do we do a spin versus if we have a strategic alternative with a buyer coming in and asking us. That will be the key issue for me, is strategic valuation for my shareholder. If we think we can make more money for my shareholder doing a spin versus a sale then we'll go that route or vice versa. If we're going to have this done by the end of this fiscal year, then we'll have to make this decision sometime in late spring, which way, we going to go left or are we going to go right. And so that's the type of timeframe that we're heading on. We just reviewed this with the board, the timeline and the approaches and keep them up to speed. But that is the decision making process. It's all about maximizing the value for my shareholder, which I am one of. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your time, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Operator : And next we'll go to Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good afternoon, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Jeff. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hey, one quick point of clarification before my question. You said to an earlier question you've had three years of negative price. Did you mean three years of negative costs? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No, I think the price. If you look at the underlying pricing of our, I believe we've reported three years of negative pricing as a company. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: This has been unusual. And we're about to go into the fourth year, I think with 2016. Even though the Fed is giving free money to everybody, the environment out there has basically been pretty tough in overall pricing of a total company \u2013 this is total company. And so I've had negative pricing basically, and net material inflation's helped us protect our profitability. And I think that we're going to see that next year, I think the negative pricing will be slightly higher but my net material inflation will be higher because of what opportunities are out there. But that's what I see and that's the type of market the industrial world has been facing for a while. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Right. But you were not in the so-called red in 2015 but you will be in 2016, by your estimation. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Right now we're not red. I think there's a good chance that we could have a slight red to that, Jeff, to be honest. My gut right now, that's all it is. I play this by feel. I know the pricing environments out there, I know the net material environments out there. You could have a couple of things go a wrong way and you could have a slight negative net material price pressure, but it's going to be very, very slight if at all. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : The main thing I wanted to touch on is cash. We haven't really talked about that yet on the call other than the opening remarks. So historically, your cash flow has actually been a lot less cyclical than your earnings, not surprisingly. We didn't really see that play out in 2015, and you made a comment about getting the balance sheet ironed out by Q2 of next year. Obviously you had the SEER build and all that going on. Can you just give us the lay of the land on how you expect cash and kind of the working capital dynamics to play out for next year? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes, historically, we get hit like we got hit in the second half of the year \u2013 typically it takes us two to three quarters once that hit happens. So we had a very good fourth quarter from a cash flow standpoint. I'm starting to see that if I look the overall inventory levels and I look at where we sit at this point in time, trade working capital is now starting to get back into line where should be, where the normal progression to see what I would call the healthy,. what I look at the 11% to 14% percent of sales of cash flow. But I think right now we're in pretty good shape. It was a tough year last year. We also had the extraordinary thing last year, we had some tax payments that we had to make in the sale of the divestiture which goes to the cash flow which mucks that up a little bit. But overall \u2013 let me see your calculator there. As I look at the cash flow last year, we did $3 billion \u2013 operating cash flow we did $3 billion, and we had $22.3 billion of sales, $23.3 billion of sales. So we were around 13.4%. I look at next year, we're going to be up around that 14%, so we are moving back up to where we need to be next year. I think it's well under our control. I think Frank and Ed Purvis did a good job and got the businesses focused, and we've pretty well got a forecast in front of us right now that makes sense, which I laid out to you and that allows us to really work that balance sheet. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And in that construct, Dave, are you including the cash repatriation you are expecting from Network Power in it? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No, we're not. That will unfold \u2013 I mean first of all, I mean that cash flow is already inside the company. It's been earned over the years, but we have not incorporated movement of cash flow, which is quite significant from both the sale/spin of Network Power and/or the Leroy-Somer CT. So there's going to be some cash flow moving around. We will be repatriating cash flow in 2016 and probably early 2017 on this whole process, which would bring to money back into the United States and we'll end up paying the taxes. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And then just one last one, same topic, is just the cash costs of what you're trying to execute in the repositioning, you've got this $300 million to $400 million marker? I am assuming some of that might just be asset impairments and the like. Can you size that for us? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. If we had an impairment, we would have to take the impairment now, Jeff. The accounting is pretty straightforward. If I thought that we were going to have an impairment, I would have to take it now. The cash flow that you saw, that number is what we're going to spend on transaction growth. Some of it's tax, some of it's advisors, and that's true cash flow that's going out. There will be another bit of cash invested in some of the investments we may have to make in IT, with some the investments we have to make in other areas, but that's not a big number overall. Probably we're looking at another $100 million, $150 million of additional cash investments that we might have to make on top of the expense spend, to the point you're getting at. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Great. I appreciate it, Dave. Thanks. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay, you're welcome. Thank you, Jeff. Operator : And next we'll go to Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Just wanted to dive into understanding another one of the numbers used, the $250 million benefit to the global cost structure. Is that just the savings or does that also incorporate some of the benefit from lower restructuring expense? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's the savings, just the savings. Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. So there's another tailwind from the lower expense, then? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: So we're trying to protect our operating profitability at around that 17% range despite the fact that our sales will be down again next year on top of this year. So that's what we're trying to protect right now. Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then from a kind of very broad high level view on the energy markets, how is consolidation phase of that cycle shaping up from your perspective, either on the supply chain where you play or in the producer complex? And is that kind of as expected so far, or how is that staging up? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: On the customer base, I think it's still early. There is some action going on right now, but I still think there's more to come based on what unfolds and when you see that, when you see what happens to the pricing, the price and the demand out there. From our perspective as a supplier in the marketplace, I think it's really early. I think you'll start seeing more opportunities happening in 2016 and maybe even all the way into 2017. Early stages still. Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Operator : And next we'll go to Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Rich. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Industrial Automation, should we think as it's currently constituted, should we think of margin improvement similar to the cadence in Process that you're anticipating on a year-over-year basis? I know you didn't do as much restructuring last year in IA, but just how should we think about that? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, we are right now, because of our Industrial Automation, the makeup of where those assets fit, and as we said, there's a lot more international. So there is a lot more being done here in the first and second quarter. But we do anticipate I mean margin improvement next year from the standpoint of what's been accomplished and also what we're doing regarding executing right now here in the first quarter. So do we anticipate, we actually do anticipate underlying improvement and margin improvement in Industrial Automation. I do not expect the top line growth to be as negatively impacted as the Process as these guys have gone through a lot of the shake-out and build-out. And so, their basic day-to-day business will stabilize. So I think that the Industrial Automation will face a little bit better top line marketplace, not quite as negative. And their restructuring they've got done will help them pick up their profitability in fiscal 2016. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And that will be back half weighted, probably more so? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. Yes. That's a good way to think about it. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. All right. And then just on US construction, you had a comment there for C&RS around you good construction markets. It sounds like you think resi and non-res are still going to be pretty good in 2016. What's your latest on that considering there has been some moving data points out there on the macro front? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think that resi, residential market, will continue to progress at a good pace. The way I look at the resi, I look at the GFI, it's been the last couple quarters, it's been 8%, 9%. And I think that's going to continue to be that 8%, 9%, 10%. I personally think that the non-res investments on the gross fixed investment have been trending downward. I think that trend will continue to come downwards and stabilize in the low single digits. It'll still be positive, but I still think that the trend line is not up but down, even though I think that people think that it will turn around in the second half of 2016, I am not of that opinion. Our forecast is built on the fact that it doesn't, it bottoms out and stays there. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Is that energy contagion influenced in your view? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes, it is. Yes, it is energy contagion. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Great, thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes, I think it's. Operator : And next we'll go to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So you said $300 million to $400 million in the cost. Does that include the assumed taxes you would pay on the, not the Network Power stuff, but the other stuff you're selling out of Industrial Automation? Or is that a different bucket? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes, we have it, if we sell the assets of Leroy-Somer CT, then and we have a tax gain, that will be separate based on what we sell the price for. That's not included in the numbers. What we're talking about is all the reorganization of trying to get these assets repositioned either for a spin or a sale, a network and also reposition for L-S CT. So that does not include that. So if we get a good value for the sale of Leroy-Somer CT, then we'll have some incremental taxes, but we'll also obviously have a cash and a gain at the same time, too. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Can we use the Power Transmission sale as kind of a guide for the book value dynamics on those businesses? Or was there something unique about the taxes that you paid on that divestiture? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think that this asset, people do want this asset. It is a unique asset from the standpoint there's a couple things that will make it different. One of them being that you have, the alternate business has a strategic, one large strategic customer. I think that I don't see the multiple, or the same type of multiple. Although it will still be a good multiple, it will not be the same dynamics that we had. And we bought these assets later in say the life of Emerson. The Power Transmission assets were bought, of lot of it was bought in the 1960s and 1970s, a little bit in the 1980s. But if you look at Leroy-Somer, that acquisition was done in 1989 and then a lot of the alternate business was done later, say in the 1990s and the 2000 time period. So I'd say the basis is probably higher. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then one last quick one, just on the Network Power side. I look at the EBIT contribution and the EBITDA contribution, and it looks to be, I don't know, around like 10% to 12% of the total. But a few people I've talked to say that the free cash flow generation of that business is higher than average. It outpunches its weight relative to EBITDA and profit. Is that correct? Is there something unique about their ability to generate cash over and above what they do on EBIT versus the other segments for any particular reason? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Well, one of the things, issues is on the Network Power businesses, there's amortization going on there which is not cash flow. So they do have because of that. So what you see, there is good cash flow bent generation. You're exactly right, Steve. There's good cash flow generation, better than you normally see, because there's amortization. It is a good cash flow generation business. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: So we take that into consideration when we look at the total (63:31). It is different than most people would think because of that issue. You're exactly right. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks a lot. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. With that, is that it? Operator : We have no further questions. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. Thank you. I want to thank everybody for calling today. Good questions, and I appreciate your input and support. And I tried to give you a little bit more clarity on what we see here for the next two to three quarters. Hopefully you have a better understanding for that. Look forward to meeting with you in Texas, and I guarantee, you will not have a foot of snow in Texas like we had a foot of snow in Boston a couple years ago. But I will look forward to meeting you down there, and I wish you well and have a safe holiday and Thanksgiving vacations. Take care now. Bye. Operator : And that will conclude today's conference call. Thank you everyone for your participation.",

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Emerson's Investor Conference Call. During today's presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be opened for questions. This conference is being recorded today, February 2, 2016. Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Craig Rossman, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead. Craig Rossman : Thank you, Alisha. I'm joined today by Dave Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's first quarter 2016 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's Web site. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the Web site for the next 90 days. I will start with the first quarter summary as shown on page two of the slide presentation. Net sales in the quarter decreased 16% to $4.7 billion with underlying sales down 9%. Our results reflected a continuation of the difficult economic conditions that were experienced during most of fiscal 2015. We continue to find ourselves in the midst of a global industrial recession, and recent economic data suggests that capital spending by industrial businesses weakened during the course of the fourth calendar quarter. In the energy sector, lower but equally as important uncertain oil prices continued to impact both operational and capital spending by our end customers. Reported earnings per share in the first quarter decreased 29% to $0.53. Adjusted earnings per share, which exclude $24 million in separation costs, were better than our previous expectation of $0.50. These separation costs relate to our portfolio repositioning actions, specifically the planned spinoff of Network Power and the potential divestitures of the Motors and Drives and Power Generation businesses. Overall, the first quarter results were slightly better than our expectations, and the company remains well positioned for a challenging 2016. Turning to Slide 3. Gross profit margin in the quarter decreased 70 basis points to 40.1%, primarily due to volume deleverage and unfavorable mix. EBIT reflects the impacts of unfavorable currency transactions of $27 million and portfolio repositioning separation cost of $24 million. Additionally, the aggressive restructuring actions initiated in 2015 are beginning to have a positive impact on profitability. During the quarter, approximately 12 million shares were repurchased for $554 million. The company still plans fiscal year share repurchase to reach approximately 1.2 billion. Turning to Slide 4. Underlying sales were down in all regions except Europe, where our euro based businesses are becoming more globally competitive. Turning to Slide 5. Business segment margin declined 170 basis points to 13.3%, primarily due to volume deleverage and unfavorable mix, partially offset by the savings from restructuring actions. Operating cash flow was down 15%, reflects the impact of lower earnings. Similar to many industrial manufacturers, capital spending was reduced due to lower global demand. Capital spending was down 30%. Turning to Slide 6. Process management underlying sales declined 11% in the quarter. Energy sector spending remained at challenging levels as lower and increasingly uncertain oil prices further pressured spending, particularly in upstream markets. Upstream projects underway will continue to completion but new projects are facing potentially further delays. Downstream markets remained favorable in the U.S., Europe, and Middle East, mainly on small to medium size projects in the chemical and power markets. We will continue to shift our resources to capitalize on more favorable business activity levels in downstream and life sciences markets. Turning to Slide 7. Industrial automation first quarter underlying sales declined 15%, reflecting continued weakness from a global industrial recession and reduced levels of spending in upstream oil and gas customers. These conditions are expected to continue into the second quarter with improvement expected in the second half of the fiscal year. Turing to Slide 8. Network Power underlying sales declined 1% in the quarter as global demand for data center and telecommunications infrastructure spending was mixed. From a regional perspective, Asia had growth in Australia, India, and South East Asia, while Latin America reflected favorable data center activity levels, particularly in Mexico. Segment margins increased 90 basis points to 8%, benefitting from restructuring actions. Recent order trends have reflected improving conditions in both data center and telecommunications investment. Turing to Slide 9. Climate technologies underlying sales declined 10% as global air conditioning sales decreased driven by higher U.S. residential demand in the prior year resulting from regulatory changes. Global refrigeration markets grew modestly, as growth in the United States and Asia was partially offset by softness in Europe. Demand in the air conditioning and refrigeration markets remains favorable, supporting our outlook for modest levels of growth in 2016. Turning to Slide 10. Underlying sales in the commercial and residential solutions segment were down 2%. Favorable activity levels in U.S. construction markets resulted in growth in both the wet/dry vacuums and food waste disposing businesses. Segment margins improved 20 basis points to 21.7% from the favorable impact of the divestiture of the InterMetro business. The favorable trends in U.S. residential and commercial construction continue to support our outlook for modest levels of growth in the segment. Turning to Slide 11. As we have indicated, we expect difficult market conditions to persist throughout the fiscal year, but we do still see a bottom forming in both sales and earnings by the middle of 2016. We will continue to execute on our operational plans while diligently working to complete the important portfolio repositioning actions that were announced last June. Taking into account our first quarter results and recent order trends, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2016 guidance. Underlying sales are expected to be down approximately 2% to 5%, excluding negative currency translation and a deduction from completed divestitures of approximately 2% each. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of $3.05 to $3.25, excluding estimated separation costs of approximately $250 million to $350 million, which are approximately $50 million lower than our previous expectations. For the second quarter, underlying sales are expected to be down approximately 4% to 6%, excluding negative currency translation and a deduction from completed divestitures of approximately 2% each. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 to $0.65 are expected excluding estimated separation costs of approximately $75 million or approximately $0.11 per share. Our long-standing commitment to return cash flow to our shareholders will be supported by an expected increase in 2016 operating cash flow to approximately $3 billion. And with that, I will now turn it over to Mr. David Farr. David Farr : Thank you very much, Craig. Thank you very much for joining us today. I appreciate that. We are looking forward to seeing our investors and analysts in Austin next week, and we will talk a little bit more about that in a second, but looking forward to really seeing everyone down there and sharing our plans and ideas to the group. I also want to thank everybody across Emerson relative to the execution in the first quarter. Clearly, this is only the first quarter, and we have a very detailed undertaking ahead of us relative to sequentially improving our sales, our profitability, our earnings and cash flow for the remaining part of this year. As I look at the plans, we started back from restructuring back in February and I look at announcement of repositioning that we announced in June, we continue to make very good progress. But it is clearly all about executing around those plans that we put in place and making sure we get it done from the standpoint of driving costs, standpoint of repositioning this company, and looking forward to how, as we go through a very challenging global economy, very challenging industrial recession that we see today and coming out of this a stronger company and one that can continue to add assets once we reposition to a new Emerson platform. Looking forward to giving you insights of how we see the 2016 unfolding from an economic standpoint, how we see the numbers happening from the cost of the repositioning, how we see the issues that we may see from a risk standpoint and what we are going to have to do about those that we see additional risk. Those are all things that we will be talking about. I will defer those until we get together next week. Also looking forward to having Bob Sharp and also Steve Sonnenberg talk about the two key business segments, business platforms that we are moving into. The commercial residential solutions and that also the automation solutions, those two individuals will give you insights to what we see the strength of these platforms, what we can do with those platforms and where we are going to invest going forward. Clearly, we have a challenging oil and gas and industrial marketplace right now but it's nothing new, we have been there before, we know what to do to deal with this issue. That\u2019s why we started the aggressive restructuring last year. As we talk amongst the business leaders, the OC and the board, if the market continues to get challenging, we will continue to do additional restructuring. We will continue to make sure that the cost structure of this company stays competitive and that we can deliver the highest level of profitability that our shareholders expect from us. That is what we are all about, right now. Executing around that and getting things forward. As I look at our current marketplace, the last 30 days have been what I would call the most unusual in my time at Emerson. I have never seen a marketplace go so volatile from the standpoint of the end markets, the stock markets, the interest rates, I guess the attitudes. It's just a very amazing marketplace right now and one that clearly global CEOs like myself have to deal with and be prepared for whatever comes at us. But we are now basically in our fourth quarter of the recession. I see, as we will talk about next week, I see at least one more quarter, maybe another quarter. But sequentially our game plan is to improve the business, cycle this business back up and start improving the profitability and that\u2019s what we are all about here. So with that I will open the floor. I am glad to have the first quarter behind us. I want to again thank the organization. They did a great job executing on the plans we put out there. We are making great progress and clearly it's only one quarter, we know that. And our game plan is sequentially improve sales, the profitability, earnings and the cash flow to our shareholders and establish the premium valuation that this company deserves. With that, I will open the floor. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Johnny Wright of Nomura. Johnny Wright : Good morning, guys. David Farr : Good morning, John -- because I didn\u2019t have anything because of the board meeting just ended, so I had to give something to my body here. Be an on the [nerve] [ph] CEO. Johnny Wright : Sure. Back in August, I think on the earnings call, Dave, you talked about process order stabilizing but if oil moved below kind of $30 or better off, looking at words to that effect. So here we are, oil is around $30. I'm just wondering how you see that playing out for process if oil stays at these levels both this year and then into FY '17? David Farr : Let me see. Chevron reported a loss. BP reported a loss. So I would say the market is stressed. So from my perspective right now, I would say the capital market in oil and gas is going to be lower. Our expectation for our process business will be lower, and we will have to do additional restructuring. We are looking at a situation, in my opinion in the oil and gas marketplaces, that will not recover until well past middle of '17, maybe late '17. Fortunately, we have 75% of the business that doesn\u2019t serve oil and gas marketplace. So even though we will talk about this next week, oil and gas spending is down, it is not going to zero. It will be a tougher marketplace and we will have to work harder at it. And clearly there is a lot of uncertainty around this, but the game is we are going to have to figure out how to get the sales, how to get the business, and get our cost down. And it will clearly be a tougher year in '16 than we thought. That\u2019s the game. Pretty straight forward. Johnny Wright : Okay. Great. And then I guess in the quarter, I guess January you guys announced a big project with Tahrir Petrochem, I think $150 million. I am just interested to see you guys taking a preferred equity investment in that customer. I am just wondering is that reflective of the competitive environment where alongside price you are now kind of having to think of other ways to win business? Or how do you think about that and how should we think about it going forward on other kind of big, large projects? David Farr : We have done some of the things in the past. This is unique. This is very strategic for the country of Egypt, and we felt that as with other people, we are not the only one that did this. We are probably the only one who has gone public with it, but I think that you will see this happening from time to time. It's a huge opportunity for us, and it really is all about forming a relationship because I think once this project is done and is successful, there will be future projects and it will happen. But it's not for every customer. It's not for every marketplace. But this one, we worked on it long time, and I have met with the CEO, and we had long conversations, and I feel that this makes a lot of sense for us relative to strategic relationship going forward. So I don\u2019t think -- it is just our commitment to making sure that these guys are successful, and we are going to have a lot of business with them for many years to come. Operator : We will go next to Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Josh Pokrzywinski : Dave, just looking at the order trends here and process in December. Obviously, the month to month can be volatile with different project activity and what stays and goes rather comp [walks] [ph]. But maybe just comment on how that month looked and any kind of body language you've gotten just with the last $10 move? Obviously, projects don't go forward on a day, a week, or even a month of oil prices, but maybe what the psychology has been with this last move down? David Farr : I think to be honest, I think the psychology is very nervous and tense within the big oil and gas investors at this point in time. I think that we see, from our perspective what we are looking at is that we will talk to you next week. We will try to encompass what we think the downside will be relative to oil and gas in the process businesses. But I would say December quarter for orders for process were not that bad. We pretty well had that factored in what's going on. I would say that my concern is the psyche of a Chevron or psyche of Exxon Mobil, psyche of these Shells and the BPs and things like that are going to kind of freeze up some of that spending level. They can't go to zero, but I think it's going to make it tougher. So my gut tells me that it is going to be more challenging in the near term and [old] [ph] process, order pace will be a drag in this, and the other businesses will start pulling back up. So that\u2019s where we are at this point in time. We will give you an update on what I think the process segment is going to do. In fact it will be more negative based on \u2013 because the the first question, I did say that when the price of oil got down to that level, it will be an impact. And I think right now our underlying sales will be more negative in the process than we thought originally and hence we are going to have to cut more costs there. But the psyche is not good in that space right now. Fortunately, there is more investments going on in the parts of the marketplace, and it's a big part of the marketplace, but the oil and gas investment area is not very good right now, and I think it's going to hurt us from the second half of this year. Josh Pokrzywinski : And obviously you'll touch more on this next week, but I think maybe looking into last quarter, the expectation on being able to hold the line on price somewhat and being able to hold the line on margins this year. Assuming all that plays out what we're seeing today, I would imagine those two items are also part of that discussion that maybe goes out of the window as well? David Farr : It's not gone out the window. From the standpoint of -- the pricing right now -- let me make a forecast for, we look at ranges. We have ranges you know. There is a reason why we go 2 to 5 or other ranges in the underlying sales, we look at also pricing environment changing too. The pricing environment today is still within the range that we laid out when we put our plan together back in August and September and just talked to you all in November. The net material inflation has continued to drop down, so we are going to give you a forecast. We are going to give you a range of what it looks like right now. But it's well within our range. I would say the one negative will be, underlying sales of process will be more negative and the profitability will still be very good. And we are going to have to take some additional restructuring both for the '16 and '17 in that space, because the recovery will be longer. And we are going to see what our customer base does right now. As you said, man, they don\u2019t move that fast but I know the psyche is not good. You just have to look at the reports that came out in the last three days or four days relative to two major oil and gas providers. Operator : We will go next to Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Dave, on last quarter's call you talked about the expectation that we might see one more quarter where inventory in the channel could be worked down and then by 2Q destocking could be high. It could be behind Emerson. Did you see -- I assume you saw continued destocking in the quarter, do you think inventories in the channel are low enough where the destocking for the whole company should end as we go through fiscal 2Q and in the second half of '16? David Farr : I would say what my knowledge is right now, inventory levels within the channel including ourselves, our levels that, they are pretty good levels, low. And so the pace of business right now and the run rate where I see, I would say the inventory levels are pretty good for us. I don't see much of a downward draft on that now. I think it's pretty well over with, probably very minor downward draft. I think it's pretty well there, around the world. I've been in Asia, have been around the world and I don't see the inventory being a big issue for us right now. So that's a good thing. Andrew Kaplowitz : Got it. And then just asking about China. You talked about China in '16 maybe being down mid-single digits on your last call, and maybe down 15% in 1Q, but you actually did down '13. So do you think China has stabilized a little bit for you in terms of the decline and are you still expecting mid-single digits for '16 to hold down in single digits? David Farr : Well, first of all, I called down '13, I would say that's a pretty good forecast call right there without knowing what was going to happen. So I know if I could do that maybe I should go into the investment mode but, just joking clearly. I think that China in my opinion today, the forecast when we put that out there, I still think it's going to be that mid-single plus digit. I think it's going to be in that 5%, 6%, 7% range negative. I don't see it changing. I would say my China organization is more optimistic than that. They are less negative. But I think that looking at what I see going on in China and the marketplaces around the world, I think that that's going to be a tough one for them to do though they are working through the inventory that was built up in the first part of 2015. But my gut tells me that I would not be surprised if we don't finish at minus 7% or 8% in China when it's all said and done. Andrew Kaplowitz : It's helpful, Dave. Thanks. David Farr : Write that down and you can see how good a forecaster I was. Andrew Kaplowitz : We'll hold you to that. David Farr : I know you will, you guys always do. Operator : We will go next to Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : And, Dave, we'll welcome you over as an analyst any time you want to come to the dark side. David Farr : I didn\u2019t say an analyst, I said investor. Joe Ritchie : Oh, investor, got it. David Farr : You know I am not that good of an analyst. You know that. I would fail. I would be fired within one week. As an investor that\u2019s a whole different story. Joe Ritchie : All right. Well, just keep your day job. So maybe focusing a little bit on your commentary about the last 30 days never being so volatile and just taking a look at the order trends. It's interesting as you look at the trends you think about the last 30 days, it's interesting that you haven't really updated your guidance for the underlying growth rate for the year. I recognize that comps are going to get easier as we get through the year but why not maybe be a little bit more, I guess, conservative with the underlying order trends or with the underlying organic growth trends for 2016? David Farr : Because I think that when we put our plan together we had certain assumptions relative to the volatility of the marketplace and what the market is going to look like. And as I look at all analysis and I look at the upsides, the downsides, I think right now we are still well within that boundary. And to come out and to widen that boundary right now is not what I find acceptable. I think our organization at this point in time, we are well within that even with the 30-day risk. I mean the risk in the 30 days is more around one piece of the company and the standpoint, I mean, Europe's not that case it's primarily around the oil and gas, the price of oil and gas investments. So it's not the whole economy but it's definitely -- I mean we encompass what we thought could possible happen to us. Now, it could get worse and I will talk a little bit about that in Austin but right now I think we are well with inside the boundaries of what we put out there. Joe Ritchie : All right. Okay. Fair enough and maybe talking about-- David Farr : By the way it helped that. We got ahead a little bit in the first quarter so it did help a little bit there that we made progress better than I thought. So, clearly it helped me a little bit. But it's obviously our easiest quarter. I mean I am not a fool, I know that. Joe Ritchie : Sure. No, that makes sense. Maybe talking about the cost actions then for a second, I just want to make sure I've got my numbers straight. You spent a little over $220 million in restructuring in 2015. I think it was another $13 million in 1Q. Can you talk a little bit about the benefits that came through this quarter? Clearly they are helping the margins a little bit and maybe your expectations on cadence as we progress through the year? David Farr : Yes. I think that what we see right now, around $80 million improvement came through in the first quarter. There will be -- from the standpoint of restructuring, there is still a big number in the second quarter. My gut tells me that we will probably be on restructuring around $20 million in the second quarter. And then we are going to be increasing this. The question is, can I get it done in the third or fourth quarter. Is it going to be more in the early part of next year? But, clearly, I think you are going to be looking at the 20 page for each quarter now as we start pushing in anticipation of concerns that we may have in the marketplace out there. Savings wise, you are going to be building from this 80, incrementally be coming up towards I would say the 90 level by the time we get into that fourth quarter. And that\u2019s basically how we see that happening per quarter. Operator : We will go next to Mike Wood of Macquarie Securities Group. Mike Wood : Good job executing in a very tough back drop. I'd like to follow-up on an earlier question on the price. Have you actually began to see the increased price competition in process and has that been rational? Just given the fact there's very little project activity out there, I'm just curious how you actually measure that price change. David Farr : Well, we measure the price change, obviously on the contracts we also measure the price change that we have to give on short-term actions from the standpoint of a day-to-day business. So it's very measurable because we can see the average pricing within the structure of the business. But you are right. There has not been a lot of big bid around what I would say the oil and gas or the other big projects. So the pricing has been rationale. The other issue is right now, like our European competitors, we are also major player in the process [world] [ph] of Europe. And so we get the benefit of that too. So what I see going to happen is we are going to be seeing sales shift to our European operation because we have been working for this last 12 months. You know the dollar really started appreciating last year, well over a year ago. So we have been working to get our rebalanced cost structure which we will continue to do. So our USP in the organization right now is seeing the benefit of the lower cost structure, so they are winning in, I would say, you are going to see other regions of the world. So we are pushing around the world just like our European competitors do. And that\u2019s one of the benefits we do have relative to having a broad manufacturing spaces on all these businesses. So I feel reasonably comfortable right now on the forecast we are going to give you for price. I mean we track this extremely hard. I don\u2019t know how long you have been following us but first when I met in the early 2002-2003 timeframe, I can't remember exactly when that was, we got side swiped on how fast this things move. But now we have created a lot tougher tracking process and so I can tell what's going on across this company. And it's going to be a little more negative this year than last year but well within what I thought we are going to see and well within the net mature inflation level. And people are acting rationale. It's going to be an interesting year to see. A lot of people are trying to improve the profitability on down volume. And dropping price in a down volume to try to prove your profitability does not work. Economic 101. It does not work. Mike Wood : Understood. And given the recent volatility you mentioned in crude, how does that impact the downstream businesses and MRO and your investments that you are making. David Farr : Two things. I am concerned that\u2019s why I think we are talking about we need to get our action together and think about, if it takes longer to recover as we go into late '16, early '17 in the process side. Because I personally think what will happen is, there will be a freeze. A little bit right now relative to a lot of our customers, as they say, okay, we are reallocating capital. We are cutting capital again 10%, what that number is going to be we will see the next 30 to 60 days. And that will create a pressure on, I know, our base relative to smaller projects and the MRO projects. So the initial reaction is, I think we are going to see a slow down and then hopefully as we get into the year, we will start seeing that capital freed back up. It can't to go zero. It's not going to go to zero but they are clearly going to reallocate and they are doing that really fast right now from our customer base. So my concern right now is, we are looking at downward pressure relative to our total sales in underlying process. We need to take capacity offline. So from my perspective right now, initial phases for the last 12 months is very much focused on people, on restructuring the overall overhead cost. And now where I want to look at -- if we are going to look at a long recovery here in this particular part of the process world, we are going to look at taking fixed assets offline. And so now that\u2019s Frank and Ed Purvis and the business leaders at their upcoming reviews which start, I think, a week or two from now, look at what extra capacity that we may need to take off permanently if we are looking at a different environment and where should that capacity be and not be. So I think that will lead to higher level restructuring later this year to early '17. Operator : We will go next to Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : You mentioned earlier that your though process would lag a recovery in some of the other businesses. But I guess if we look at industrial automation, it does seem if it's got pretty bad. So maybe just comment on how you say IA playing out. And related to that, any color you can give on orders in January? David Farr : I don\u2019t have orders for January yet. This is February 2, so I don\u2019t have that yet. It's a little bit quick for me and the company. But relative to IA, I think IA got hit harder, sooner relative to the space they are in. And so there might be a little downside risk in IA but not that much. I think these guys are sitting really down, pretty far right now. I mean things can always go down further but my gut tells me they are pretty close to that cycle right now. The process guys because of the type of business they have, they are still coming off some of the wins and things they won last couple of years. So I think that they will continue to Slide a little bit here. And that\u2019s my biggest concern right now. If I look at the '16 forecast, I always have little IA concern but my biggest concern would be the process guys at this point in time. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And then Network Power, orders look a little less bad than a few months ago. Margins are up. You have a big project in Europe you are working on. But outside and beyond that, do you think that you have succeeded now in sort of stabilizing the earnings in Network Power and the rest of the year we should see that stable margin play out? David Farr : Yes. Yes. I think if you look at the underlying order pace of our Network Power business, is actually noses up. And as of right now even, I was talking to Scott Barbour today and his team is doing a great job out there. The nose is up, continues to move the right way. Profitability continues to move the right way. These guys took some serious actions, hard actions the last 12 or 18 months and right now I feel good about, it's a broad base and I feel good that these guys are heading the right way. As of right today that\u2019s what I feel. So I feel good about that. I think they had a very good first quarter. I mean it's a long way to go but they have been noses up right now. That\u2019s a good place to be in any business as you know. Operator : We will go next to Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Steven Winoker : Dave, given all the commentary and sort of how obviously the volatility is right now, what's going on with the process, the capital deployment process or should I say the sale process for industrial automation, some of those assets and the separation activities for Network Power. Is that delayed in anyway? David Farr : The Network Power asset, there is no delay going on. We have the fuel path looking at strategic buyers within that business. We also have the fuel path of moving right down towards the spend. So that half is well underway. On the industrial asset, automation assets, I would say that based on what we see right now, we are probably two to three months behind where I want to be relative to the discussions with strategic buyers. So I would say Network Power heading okay. Industrial automation, given the tactical customer base, a lot of my potential customers or buyers are clearly are seeing some tough times too. So I would say that one is a little bit delayed by couple of months. But that as of right now today as I report to the board. Steven Winoker : Okay, Dave. And then also the combination of process and industrial, in other words the future structure of the business, the future Emerson here. Are you taking actions already to combine overhead or other elements of these two businesses yet or is it just standalone, frankly, until you got that other process down and then you will go down this one. David Farr : We are -- I would be very careful here -- relative to this business we are taking some actions early on the combination. Not totally across the board but in certain select areas in preparation of it. So that will be, by time we get into the middle of this year, those actions will underneath way. On the commercial residential solutions business, we are embarking upon it as we speak. And so both are well on their way. I made a commitment to the board, I made a commitment to the individuals and I think I probably told you guys that by the end of the second, halfway the third quarter, we are going to have these things structured properly. Now it doesn\u2019t mean are things done but that\u2019s what the game plan is at this point in time. Operator : We will go to Eli Lustgarten of Longbow Securities. Eli Lustgarten : One quick question on the process side. You talk about the upstream projects, some on completion new projects. What portion of the business at this point still relates to the upstream projects that are being completed and how much does that disappear. In what sense does that go to as you look through the year? Does that basically go to a very minor part or how do we handle that? David Farr : I don\u2019t have those exact numbers. I can't give that. I can't break it out that way. I know what our oil and gas percentage will be this year in upstream. I mean I know it's still going to be a significant percentage of or total business and it will be next year too because it's not going to zero. People just don\u2019t stop it. We will give you our best feel or it on next week. I have some ideas where we think the segment is going to go. But they don\u2019t move that fast. So it's really hard to say because what we talk about, what you think about are not necessarily how everyone looks at this business in a day to day standpoint. So I can't give you that information to be honest. And its [indiscernible] Eli Lustgarten : I am just trying to sense, is that the part that\u2019s disappearing. Are you trying to say are we closer to bottom of that impacting or sort of indicating that by middle of the year? David Farr : No. I don\u2019t think it is. We will talk next week. Eli Lustgarten : And you talk about having to do more restructuring in process because of market that's quite easily understood. But can you talk about whether you're starting to look at industrial automation in the same way? I mean it's a very weak market. Conditions or so that there's more of, or a second level of restructuring there to try to hold profitability better because that profitability could be under a lot of pressure if the demand stays in the current way. David Farr : Well, we have laid out the restructuring that we have intended to do this year relative to the industrial automation business and that\u2019s well on our way. I am also in the process of selling that business. So from my perspective, I mean I believe that there is more additional restructuring most likely [indiscernible] from the potential buyer of the company. I have a business plan laid out which is being worked out right now. I don\u2019t see anything at this point in time. If we make the decision we are not going to sell this industrial automation asset then this [owner] [ph] right now, we are down the path, then if we are going to sell that asset. Operator : We will go next to John Inch of Deutsche Bank. John Inch : So last quarter you called out, in general, incremental concerns possibly about Middle East. Has your thought process changed because there's obviously been some conjecture around possible efforts to curtail production and you called it volatile. I'm just curious, has anything changed in the last few months with respect to your perspective on Middle East? David Farr : No. My perspective on the Middle East hasn\u2019t changed. I think that the risk I see today in the world for spending, and your talk about say the oil and gas, the type of spending that goes on and just the process of spending. North America, China and Latin America. Those are three concern areas I have relative to the spending around that industry. I was just coming back from the Middle East. I mean the national oil companies have to spent a certain level of money and they have been cutting back and I think we probably have that build in. So I feel okay there right now, as of right now. And I see some major crisis going to erupt in the Middle East, you know things falling up and stuff like that. But right now, I feel reasonably good about that. But concerns are North America investments and the concerns we are going to have on companies that may not make it or be consolidated. And then China, clearly concerns. My forecast of China is worse than probably most people would say out there. So I am a little concerned about that one. John Inch : No, that makes sense. Dave, a year ago at the analyst meeting you made comments that you thought Canada's petroleum industry was probably going to be better than people expected because there were a lot of obviously reasons for it. Efforts to support domestic businesses, that sort of thing. Do you think that's changed? The dollar has collapsed a lot and I guess debatably it makes that country a little more export competitive or what not. I'm just wondering if you think because it's such an important trading partner with the United States, if you think the outlook for Canada is kind of where you thought it was before? It's sort of a similar question on the Middle East, only for Canada. David Farr : I would say it's worse. One, they have a new type of government there that doesn\u2019t necessarily care for this industry. And secondly the price where it is right now, it's not good. So I would say, from our perspective what we have been doing is we have been restructuring and downsizing in Canada. I mean it's an important market but strategically it is going to be a tough market for the next two years. John Inch : Just lastly, Dave. You obviously touch an awful lot of the verticals, right, lots offer different things. So kind of ex-petroleum, do you think that, I mean are you guys tracking maybe some end markets or verticals or other things within Emerson that actually could be contributively positive or surprise kind of to the upside, let's call it in the next, I don\u2019t know, 6-12 months? David Farr : Yes. I am going to give -- we are going to give you a different view of the verticals and the growth rate next week. And I think the answer is yes. I think there are some verticals that are going to do better than people think. And that\u2019s where -- you know we started talking about this last summer. We have been reallocating our resources, really pushing hard to reallocate our resources. We had a very very good run in oil and gas upstream and we gained a lot of growth, gained a lot of market share. And now what we are doing is refocusing those resources and so we will talk a little bit about that next week because what you just said is exactly right. And there are markets out there and the whole organization in process management is focused on how they can go after those markets and re-energize their workforce to go after that. Operator : We will go next to Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Robert McCarthy : Maybe we can just go back to, I think kind of a question I asked on the last call. But just given what you see in process and obviously your commentary throughout the last 30 days, I think implicit in your guidance for fiscal '16 was some firming of order trends in terms of kind of the March-April timeframe. I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, but I think it was to that effect. And then you know... David Farr : I mean exactly what I said -- you are not putting -- and I will tell you again today that I will show you a chart next year that I am saying we will, I'd say right now the call April 1, our orders go positive. It's total [positive] [ph]. I said that last time on the call, I am still saying that. Now for whatever, you know what but I am making that call and I will stand by that call. Robert McCarthy : All right. And you don't want to move the call to April 2, maybe but...? David Farr : Well, because it's April fool's day, so I can get that. Robert McCarthy : Okay David Farr : I made that call back then, I am standing by that call. Robert McCarthy : Okay, fair enough. I guess the only other question I have is, you did mention, and this dovetails with the question I just asked, but I think you did mention like we've come through four quarters of what looks like an industrial recession. You think there's about one to two left. Are you seeing anything in the GFI or just the order patterns or trajectory, absent process management vertical where it's obviously dynamic and tied to the commodity price, where you can kind of point to an upward trajectory or reason for recovery there in terms of the macro? David Farr : Yes. The answer is yes. And the call is April 1. And I am talking about the April orders, you know that. And then we are right now, Frank and I will sit here, we will tell you we believe that our underlying sales will go positive in the third quarter. Based on the -- I felt that all along, and Frank has crossed his fingers over there, he is a great CFO, he really stays right behind us. He is right behind be with a gun to my back. But, no, I still believe that. And the key issue, now keep in mind, if you are paying attention, we said that first quarter underlying sales will be down, probably 9% to 10%. We finished a little bit under 9%. Last time I talked on the phone I said underlying sales will be down 5% to 7% in the second quarter. I am now, Frank and I believe that our underlying sales will be down 4% to 6% in the second quarter. So the key issue for is, as we map out and we get together, we will give you the insight on orders when we are together next week. We are trying to get orders, somebody asked me a question about January, we will try to get those so we can at least have a sense on where to go the next week. [indiscernible] would stop going to play basketball so much and watching Lebron James. Maybe we could get them but. So I think right now I am standing behind that. I mean the chart is going to say, April, orders to above positive and third quarter sales will have a plus in underlying sales. And we will not be standing there talking to me. Robert McCarthy : Well, we've got our line in the sand. I'll see you next week. David Farr : I like to draw lines. You know me. Operator : We will go next to Scott Davis of Barclays. Scott Davis : I'm trying to reconcile, I think like everybody else, I mean you're bearish but you're still calling things getting better in April. And I think the angle I want to take is that, and there's a good and bad here, and the good is that you mentioned the comment fixed assets off line and we've been writing and we think the entire industry needs to do this. But you guys are the only ones that are really doing it. So how do we get out of this mess if you're one of the only companies that's willing to admit that it's a, for lack of a better word, a bit of a site-show out there. How do we get out of this mess to where even if your orders turn, call it slightly positive, I mean it's probably more flattish than positive to be more realistic, but how do we get out of this. I think...? David Farr : It will be above the line. I have actually got my nose above the water, it [counts] [ph] Scott. Scott Davis : Well, what's it going to take to get us out of this mess is my question really, Dave. Because again unless everybody capitulates, which we saw in 2002, we saw it in 2009. Doesn't it just start to bleed into different components of the economy and different businesses that you sell into that aren't being impacted right now start to see impact as we get later on in the, call it cycle? David Farr : You know, I can't speak to other people. I mean they've got to be looking at the same issues from the standpoint of too much cost, too much capital, fix that investments invested. They've got to be looking at that and so eventually they are going to have to say look, we've got to take action. A good leader -- if they don't take action I think there will be some other people coming and working on that issue. But from our standpoint I feel quite strongly as you know. We're trying to deal with this issue. We make calls. I make calls, as you know my for a long time. I make a call. Sometimes I call right, sometimes I call wrong. But you have to make calls and say we've got too much capacity, things are going to be down longer, you've got to deal with it. And we started seeing this happen last year and I think other people are now maybe just starting to see it and starting to deal with it. But if you don't have the capability of dealing with it sometimes you just sit there and tread water and watch your profitability get hit. I think there are several companies out there in my opinion in the industry right now that are doing a good job in dealing with this issue. There are several companies that are not and you know that. You can see it. And I don't have that magic call. I can tell you what we could do. And so I know right now that certain things are going the right way. I have a feel for what things are but I do know that given right now, given where the price of oil & gas is and potentially where it could go, we fundamentally will have a capacity issue on that industry which we didn't have say 12 months ago. And so we have got to think about how we deal with that issue and as you know it also takes time. But that's on the table right now and no one wants to deal with that because that\u2019s really a hard thing to deal with. But you got to deal with it period. Scott Davis : Yes. Understood, and I'm encouraged by your comment on price being relatively rational. It was in the last cycle as well but there's always little tidbits out there. Caterpillar has been talking about the alternator contract they have with you guys and trying to drive price down. You view that as more of a one-off or do you have multiple situations going on like that but you've been able to hold on price because the competing bids haven't been any better? David Farr : From the standpoint I think most people are being rational on this thing. Our contract, capital as a contract, and the contract is set and they have the right to go do what they want to do, but the contract is set. And so from the standpoint of the overall industry I would say the biggest issue right now is because volumes are dropping for people and they have excess capacity, trying to fill plan up with a lower price is not a very smart thing to do because it doesn't work for you. That's why I think it's been more rational here. And so far we mapped it out and Frank and Ed Purvis and all the business leaders laid out a plan what they thought last summer, early fall. We will look at it again right now on the pricing and it's pretty well in line and I feel good about it. But like I said, 10 years ago, or was it 12 years ago, I got really side swiped and so that's why we spend more time on it than probably the average company. Operator : We will go next to Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan: Hey, Dave, just within the process spending that you are seeing, I mean we went through this period which seems like in a lot of cases we are still in where seemingly everything was getting cut upstream, mid-stream, downstream, maintenance spending. The spending that you are seeing happening, whether it's some of the downstream stuff or the chemical, what are the projects exactly? What are people willing to spend on right now? David Farr : On the big projects, say upstream is that it's a project to certain in time that they see that spending -- I will make a number up, a billion dollars more to get cash flow. The customer is going to move forward with that because if you are stuck 75% of your projects and you stop it, you got a problem. Because the project won't be that good but the time you come back to it in five years or whatever it is. So most people you see and those monies will get spent. Now every time they go through a process they are having to cut capital within that industry, that will fine tune that. But most people are taking advantage of the environment right now to go out and improve, I would say the efficiency of the facility. So spending on small capital projects, upgrades will help to get more out of the facility, higher quality, higher yields. So that\u2019s what they are spending right now to get more of each facility. So I see them still spending money. It's just an interesting process. They are going through the process of being very selective. When things were going their way they threw a lot of money at everything. So the money is still being spent but it's definitely being a lot more selective and it's going to be much more on how can I prove the investments we have made over the last ten years. Get me more money out of that given the fact that my oil prices or down or my inputs are down, what can I do. So they are being a lot more selective along on those lines. Which is a good business for us but clearly you don\u2019t have the big projects which give you a lot of top line growth for the big bank. But there is money being spent out there. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. And then on Network Power, nice margin result there in the quarter. It's been a while since Network Power margin has beat my expectations. Is that a function of having kind of cleared any major part of the restructuring or just a lag of getting this stuff to kind of show up in what you're shipping in terms of the numbers, or is there a reason why it sort of finally came through now? David Farr : I think that across Network Power, from the standpoint of actions they started undertaking last summer and started flowing through. And they exist in that, we have been working them. It's really starting to come through in the final P&L. So it started actually around the last month or last year or the fiscal year September and it's [preceding] [ph] each month. So our expectation is that this will continue to take hold based on what we see happening in that market. So we should see a sequential type of margin improvement in that business. Which would be good because Scott and his team have really attacked this. They are getting out of certain business, they are investing in other businesses. I think they have done a great job in evaluating where they want to be and the cost structure they have. And now they are executing around that flexibility. And my hats off to that team in a very dynamic marketplace. So I think they are heading the right way and I feel good about that. They did a great job executing the first quarter. Operator : We will go next to Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo. Rich Kwas : So, Dave, just broadly speaking, given what's going on in oil & gas here in North America, are you seeing any signs in your other businesses of meaningful contagion in CRNS or climate. Anything that you would point out here? You talked about the last 30 days being volatile. Just any thoughts there because obviously there's a lot more concern in the market in the last 60 days or so? David Farr : Yes. I would say we have not seen it yet, Rich, from the order pattern that we saw in December. I don\u2019t know, even the forecast for January, I didn\u2019t see anything. It could take a little while but we don\u2019t see it yet. I think the marketplace has definitely been very volatile. I think the marketplace is starting to see numbers that we have been seeing. Now we have been -- if you look at the fourth calendar quarter, the third calendar quarter, they were pretty tough quarters for companies like Emerson. And so the market is now digesting that news as they saw it come out in the earnings report and the comments people are making right now. Let's say a little bit more negative about 2016. So I would say that we have been trying to get ahead of that and at this point in time I feel that we have got that size. I don\u2019t see the knock on effect of what we saw the volatility both from the marketplace and then also the commodity place in January. We will have to watch it very carefully, unfold. And if I look at the construction, residential construction, the residential spending, the consumer spending in the areas that we are, they are still holding up pretty well right now. So we will see. I mean 30 days is pretty short. You guys give us a few more days here. Rich Kwas : Understood. David Farr : I know you are very quick compared to me but. Rich Kwas : On process in terms of M&A, you talked about deploying some capital there for this year. With what's happened here, incrementally more interested or less interested? How should we gauge that over the course of '16 in terms of the opportunities you're seeing right now? David Farr : I am interested. Higher interest. You can never call what time to buy and from my perspective right now, I think that there unique assets out there that I would like to buy. And our cash, you know Frank is over here working on how we are going to get cash back in the United States with the spin, the divestitures. And we are going to talk a little bit about that next week so from my standpoint, I will look at this as a buying opportunity. And I talked with my board today and the board is right there. They are on me, on is to make sure we execute and we execute as hard as possible around this repositioning, the restructuring. And then spend that money to make Emerson a better company long term and we have got opportunity here and let's think how hard we play with it. So that\u2019s what we are all about. Rich Kwas : Okay, thanks. By the way I thought Rossman was up for the [cavs] [ph] coaching job. I guess that didn't play out. David Farr : He just missed it. They called me at it. They called me and I said, he was questionable with his leadership capability and I also felt that he would have a hard time coaching a guy that\u2019s seven foot tall. Operator : And we will go next to Deane Dray of RBC. Deane Dray : Just thought it was interesting how in a period of significant volatility we have all been questioning you about what you're seeing here, but you're also giving quarterly guidance. That's not really what -- Emerson didn't used to be in the quarterly guidance business but where is the additional confidence, where's the additional visibility? I mean it's certainly welcome, but it's a change. David Farr : The change, I may go back, you know me I have around few years. It's all about right now that we are on a detailed plan that we started executing last June and I want to make sure you guys understand where we are relative to that transition. And I want to make sure you guys get clarity around what I see sequentially happening each quarter. And the management team has been working, is very aggressive right now. We have been discussing with the board and I think it's very important for you all to understand what I see happening each quarter. We see happening each quarter and that clarity. Now once we come back to normalcy in the marketplace, we may go right back to -- necessarily I don\u2019t believe in quarterly guidance but just go right back to old way. But right now I think we are in through this transition period. I think it's very very important for you to understand what's on our mind and where we see standing [indiscernible] how we are positioning each quarter. And so we are going to actually give you clarity on things next week on the second quarter which you probably would never get from us. I think it's important that we stay joined in the hip here. Some of you are right there with me, some of you don\u2019t necessarily agree with us. It's all about execution. Can we execute and I am telling you what the roadmap looks like, what the band looks like each quarter and I will get through this quarter and I will tell you the third quarter. Deane Dray : Yes. It's a great perspective and it is a change and in a period of this uncertainty to have your line of sight on this is appreciated. And then just have a niche follow up on commercial and resi. It was interesting for professional tools, you wanted to blame that also on upstream spending and I just never thought professional tools was as tied to that, but maybe I'm wrong. David Farr : Now you are talking to one of the former presidents of Ridge Tool. Deane Dray : I know. David Farr : And the former president of Ridge Tool that went through a last recession, a really tough recession we had. We have a significant part of that business that sell specialty tools and equipment to the oil and gas producers and users, upstream and downstream. And if this whole industry stops spending and the first things is that it just drives right up, around the world. And that is a big chunk of our business there and it's significant enough from the standpoint it's big and it's also profitable. And all I can tell you is I thought I was going to be fired at the division president in my first 12 months when I came in here and oil and gas hit me back in the early 1990-1991. It's tough. That\u2019s what it is. It's not made up, trust me it's there. Deane Dray : Understood. See you next week. David Farr : Look forward to guys. I have to get going. I apologize. I know we have a lot of questions. We have got to cut some people off. I don\u2019t have any idea who I cut off. I didn\u2019t look at the list. I was no selective here. I want to appreciate everybody for calling and I appreciate the questions. And I am going to try to be open and honest as possible in this situation, give you an idea of where we are trying to go. But clearly, I am giving the clarity that I see what my management team right now and it's our call and that\u2019s what we are going to do up here for this year to make sure we are all on the same journey together as we come out of 2016. Thank you very much. Bye. Operator : And this concludes our conference for today. We thank you for your participation.",

Thank you for standing by and welcome to Emerson's investor conference call. During today's presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. This conference is being recorded today, May 3, 2016. Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Craig Rossman, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead, sir. Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you, Matt. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's second quarter 2016 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on the Emerson website at Emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. I will start the presentation with the second quarter summary, as shown on slide two. Net sales in the quarter decreased 9% to $4.9 billion, with underlying sales down 5%. As we anticipated, served markets were mixed, as oil and gas and industrial markets remained under pressure, particularly in North America where conditions were tougher. On the positive side, market conditions were more favorable in HVAC and U.S. construction. Data center and telecommunications spending improved during the quarter as well. Reported earnings per share decreased 60% to $0.57. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.66, which exclude $56 million of total separation costs, were slightly above our expectations. Profitability in the quarter benefited from the significant restructuring actions we completed in 2015 and solid operating performance across our businesses. Improved working capital performance generated strong operating cash flow of $719 million in the quarter. Overall, the second quarter exceeded many of the company's expectations, and we remain on track for fiscal 2016. Turning to slide three, gross profit margin was up 40 basis points due to cost reductions and containment actions, and lower SG&A expense benefited from restructuring actions. The year-over-year change in EBIT reflects the impact of separation costs of $31 million and a $932 million divestiture gain from the Power Transmission Solutions business in the prior year. Excluding the gain and the separation costs, EBIT margin increased 70 basis points. Turning to slide four, underlying sales decreased in all regions except Europe. The results were similar to the first quarter, which are noted on the slide for your reference, as the global economies are still not showing much strength. Turning to slide five, business segment margin improved 140 basis points to 14.6%, led by year-over-year margin improvement in the Network Power, Climate Technologies, and Commercial & Residential Solutions segments. Restructuring was a positive, as savings from the 2015 restructuring actions and lower expense in the current year were a benefit across the segments. Comparisons in Corporate and Other were driven by an increase of $46 million in stock compensation resulting from share price appreciation, pre-tax separation costs of $31 million, and a 2015 divestiture gain of $932 million. Working capital performance drove an operating cash flow improvement of 101% in the quarter. Turning to slide six, Process Management underlying sales decreased 9% in the quarter. Oil and gas customer spending remained a headwind across the regions, but was more pronounced in certain markets like the Canadian Oil Sands and the U.S. Efficiency and productivity projects continue to gain traction with customers in the energy sector, as interest and engagement continued to increase. Project opportunities in power in the U.S., Asia, Europe, and the Middle East Africa continue to support growth, while chemical markets across various regions continue to be favorable as well. Segment margin decreased 20 basis points, primarily from volume deleverage and mix, but were partially offset by savings from restructuring actions, which will continue to benefit profitability in the remainder of the fiscal year. Turning to slide seven, Industrial Automation second quarter sales declined 10%, reflecting continued weakness in industrial and upstream oil and gas spending. Power-generating alternator sales are at a 10-year low. Alternative energy wind projects were a bright spot for the drives business. Segment margin decreased 50 basis points, primarily due to volume deleverage, unfavorable mix, and price, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions and materials cost containment. Slightly better market conditions and easing comparisons are expected to improve both underlying growth and profitability in the second half of fiscal 2016. Turning to slide eight, Network Power underlying sales were down 1% in the quarter. The global demand for data center and telecommunications infrastructure improved during the quarter. Telecommunications power systems had particularly strong growth in North America. Segment margin improved 490 basis points to 8.1%, mainly benefiting from restructuring actions. New product programs and the segment's global repositioning strategy are starting to flow through to both sales and profitability. Improving order transfer both data center and telecommunications investment will drive positive third quarter sales growth and improved margins. Turning to slide nine, Climate Technologies underlying sales increased 2%, driven by the U.S. residential and commercial air conditioning business, which was up 10%. Europe reflected strong growth across the region. The refrigeration business was up high single digits. Segment margin increased 170 basis points, primarily due to significant savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment. Favorable air conditioning and refrigeration end markets should continue to support improvement in underlying growth through the remainder of the fiscal year. Turning to slide 10, underlying sales in the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment increased 2%. Favorable conditions in the U.S. construction markets, particularly residential, were supportive for growth. The divestiture of the Commercial Storage business reduced year-over-year sales by 16%, but had a positive impact on segment margin, which improved 380 basis points to 23.2%. Favorable trends in U.S. residential construction are expected to continue, supporting the outlook for modest levels of underlying growth and margin improvement in the remainder of the fiscal year. Turning to slide 11, while the global economic environment for Emerson businesses will continue to be challenging, demand has begun to stabilize or improve in certain markets. Comparisons in the second half of the year also become easier due to the significant decline in underlying sales during fiscal 2015. As we have indicated, order trends remain in line with expectations and therefore continue to support our assumptions that 2016 underlying sales will be down 2% to 5%, excluding negative currency translation of 1% and a 2% deduction from completed divestitures. Underlying sales in the third quarter are expected to be approximately flat to the prior year. We also reaffirm our guidance that adjusted earnings per share will be $3.05 to $3.25, excluding $250 million to $300 million of separation costs related to the company's portfolio repositioning. Adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter are anticipated to be flat to the prior year or approximately $0.85, excluding $145 million of separation costs. And now I'll turn it over to Mr. David Farr. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much, Craig. Thank you very much for joining us today. I appreciate your time. And as you can see, fundamentally this was a very solid quarter. And I want to thank the entire global organization relative to execution around the significant restructuring starting last year and continuing to run through this year, and the results are starting to flow through as they did for the last three quarters. Poor profitability has now begun to improve, and we're exhibiting strong cash flow and very good performance. And again, I want to thank the global Emerson organization out there for doing some very difficult heavy lifting in a very challenging marketplace. As we've talked about, since November I've been talking about fixed rate orders. We're going to reach a goal by April. I'm not quite sure yet. But as we've looked at the order pace through the last several months, step by step by step, with October being the bottom, we've seen continued improvement. Last month's three-month roll, we basically saw around negative 4%. We do not know what the April ending numbers will be, which we report \u2013 we're talking about reporting around the May Electrical Products Group meeting. But right now, my gut tells me we've seen some weaker North America oil and gas spending on the short cycle, and clearly we're seeing very weak spending around the backup power generator marketplace, which as we see it is running at an 11-year low. But we might be close, and we'll know when we get it all in. But it might be May, but we haven't given up on April yet. And I know I can tell you this much. We're going to be close enough that my 14-month-old Zorro might be able to jump that rope and get there, but I do know there has been some weakening in the North America oil and gas spending route and the alternate route for sure. The overall performance this quarter relative to the operations was very good in a very challenging marketplace. You think about the balance sheet, the cash flow, the earnings setting up for us what we believe is a very important milestone again in the third quarter, with hopefully underlying sales getting close to zero and our earnings per share being flat with improved margins. Again, very important milestones as we quickly work through the process. And the operations have done a lot of heavy lifting here and the restructuring is really starting to pay off. From my perspective right now, as I look at the global marketplace, I just came back from Europe. Europe, our Western European business has continued to improve. I finally see some good momentum there. No, the economy is not going to be robust there, but they clearly are making investments. They're making strategic investments. They have some exports. And so underlying, we see our European business being a benefit, a positive versus what it was a couple months ago. To the U.S., the U.S. economy in particular around the industrial segment has continued to be challenging. And in certain segments, I would say even weaker within the U.S. marketplace. The rest of world basically is trending along the lines that we've been talking about for the last two or three, four quarters, including what we talked about at our Analyst Meeting in February. So not a whole lot of change as I see it, the pluses coming from Europe, the minuses coming from the U.S. Network Power business orders continued to be improving and positive, and we expect Network Power to have positive growth in the third quarter at the top line and positive growth in earnings. We expect the Commercial & Residential Solutions, that business to continue to be positive, and we also expect our Climate Technology business to do reasonably well. But one market they're struggling with right now is China residential. The rest of the world, they're progressing and doing extremely well. And obviously, you can see some of the profitability coming through in some of these businesses as they've got the restructuring done in the second half of last year and the early part of this year. From a restructuring standpoint, we're going to be around this, Frank, I think we were talking about $60 million to $80 million \u2013 $70 million to $80 million. We are looking at areas right now where we've seen weaknesses where we will ramp up a little bit more restructuring. What we have is pretty well in focus. As we look at this year, we're also starting look at opportunities as we've now formed the two strategic businesses underneath two leaders of Mike Train and Bob Sharp, and we're looking at programs that we'll institute coming forward in 2017 and 2018 to I would say create a more best cost, structural, global organization and manufacturing process. And the opportunities that we can then look at taking more cost out, both for profitability, but also to increase investments for growth in some of the technologies and innovations area. So overall, I'm pleased with the opportunities there and look forward to continuing to figure out how we can generate higher levels of profitability in the two core businesses that will remain as we finish the repositioning. Relative to the repositioning, as we reviewed with the board last night and again this morning, we're making progress. The Network Power program bolt (14:22) is on the table at this point in time. We're looking at either a sale or a spin. Both are viable at this point in time. And the board along with input from the management team are getting closer and closer to making that final decision, and we will be making that final decision. We have filed the initial spin documents, which you have to do, and we'll continue to refine those documents based on input from the SEC. But from our standpoint right now, both options of what we're going to do with the business to create value for our shareholders and value for us as a company going forward are still on the table and are still actively being worked. And it is not a problem. I know people like to speculate and people like to aggravate, but this is a process that's well underway and well in focus and well in line with what we expected. Relative to Leroy-Somer CT, Control Techniques, again, we have a lot of viable global \u2013 global potential buyers of these assets, and that process is well underway. And even despite the tougher marketplace we see in that market we're selling, we still have a good, good opportunity there to sell these businesses for what I would say a respectable price and exit that and take that money and reinvest it back into Emerson and the two core businesses that we're going to maintain. We also reviewed today significant acquisition opportunities with the board. One thing good about the world today and the struggle relative to a lot of companies, there are unique acquisition opportunities out there, both from a technology standpoint, both from a commercial and residential standpoint, and also from the automation solutions standpoint. So we're looking for opportunities to reinvest the proceeds, and the objective is to take that money and reinvest it back into the core businesses and eventually get back into a $20 billion-plus corporation, but a much more focused and selective and profitable business. As we talked about in February, when we come out of this transition, we will be a more profitable business, we'll be a more focused business, and we'll be more very much focused on doing significant acquisitions around these two businesses. And once again, regaining the size that I think is appropriate relative to what we need to do on a global basis. So I like where we sit today. We're pivoting from significant restructuring to getting closer to growth in orders, significant growth in improved profitability, and pivoting towards the completion of the repositioning of the two core businesses we're trying to get out, and positioning ourselves towards making additional acquisitions, and great progress along those lines. No more specific details than I just gave you, so you can ask and I will say no comment. But that's the flavor we are right now, and good discussion with the board for a lengthy term last night and again today relative to that. But again, as we wrap up here and open up for questions, again, very, very good execution by the operating folks, from Frank and his team, and Ed Purvis and Ed Monser, and then all the business leaders out there. I truly appreciate it. They're really working this hard and trying to create a higher level of profitability and a higher level of cash flow for us to have the opportunity to reinvest and grow this company again. So with that, I'll open the mic for questions. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, we'll take a question from Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Good afternoon, Dave. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Scott. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I've got to admit, those Network Power orders popped back a little faster than probably some of us would have thought. Give us a sense, like were there some timing issues, maybe some big projects that got thrown into February or March? Or is it again, just such bombed out comps that we're likely to continue to see some pretty good levels from here? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: That's a pretty negative approach to thinking about that, Scott. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I just have to ask. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You must be watching TV too much, Scott. That's all I can think about. No, it's a fair ask. There are a couple things going on. As you know, when we went through the period of significant restructuring and trying to change the organization, we went through a period of having to develop I would say a more selective type of product portfolio for the market changes and opportunities. It did give us a chance to really have a better package to go out and sell and a more a focused approach with the organization. And also clearly, the comps got a little bit easier. But the most important thing here is the work that Scott Barbour and his team did over the last couple years in getting their team focused around the different channels, the different products, the different solutions. And now I think that that focus and that cost structure we've put in place really are allowing these guys to compete and win, and it's a global thing. And so that is very good to see. So we have a long way to go with that business, but it's nice to have it healthy and carrying a load right now. So that's what's really going on. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good. Dave, is there a sense, can you give us a little bit of sense on timing? And I know you said you weren't going to give any details. But are we talking about having Network Power wrapped up in three months, or is it more like six months? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: From our perspective, if you go the route of a sale, most likely it will be a little longer from the standpoint of a review and approval process. There's a lot of regulation. It's a very, as you know, a global, global business, so a lot of people will be reviewing that. A spin is one that you could have, assuming we don't know what the SEC will do from an input standpoint, but our focus right now if we decide to go the route of a spin, it will be towards the end of the fiscal year, if not just right after the fiscal year. If we have to sell it and have to go through a review process, it could be a couple months longer. But right now, we still look at some time in the September/October \u2013 end of September/October/November time period for that based on the way we go. But that's the timeframe we're looking at there, Scott. On Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques, again, it really depends. There is a sale process. If we have to go with an international person relative to a potential strategic buyer there, it will take I think from a review standpoint both from the various governments around the world longer. Both the U.S. government and the European government, as you know, there's a substantial position for Leroy-Somer CT in France. So I think that's going to definitely be most likely by the time it's completed in the fourth calendar quarter. But what you'll hear from us some time most likely this quarter or end of this quarter or early next fourth quarter, you'll hear which way we're going. You'll hear from us, sale or spin. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Am I to assume that that's not a gating factor in doing deals, that you'd be comfortable doing a deal even before those things were announced, or do you feel like... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Correct. Our financial position right now is we can go out and do deals right now. And we are doing deals, but we could do several billions of dollars of deals right now if we need to. We have the financial capability. Spin, sale, it doesn't make much difference. We have the capability of doing that right now. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Good luck, Dave. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you. And, Scott, as a follow-up to that, one of the reasons why we did stop the share repurchase in the second quarter and most likely tail it back again in the third quarter is to make sure that we do have the financial flexibility to do the type of transactions. The market is starting to open up, and we just want to make sure we have the capability. And we can always come back and do the share repurchase, which we're now looking at probably around $1 billion this year versus what we've said earlier. So that's another thing we've done. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, we'll see you down at EPG [Electrical Products Group]. Thank you, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you, see you. Operator : At this time, we'll move to Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good morning, thanks. Good afternoon, I should say. Sorry. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Gautam. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: I was wondering if you could expand on your comments about some of the oil and gas orders weakening or what have you, the pace of activity weakening. And if you could, just expand on what you saw, if it related to any specific type of projects. And if you could, comment more broadly on any repricing of the backlog or customers pushing back on existing orders and trying to reprice them lower. Thanks. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Relative to the second question, the answer is nothing. We're not seeing that type of pressure from us from that standpoint on a repricing of a commitment from one of our customers. And that's not an issue relative to this space at this point in time. Relative to North America and particularly the U.S., it's primarily just the day-to-day type of spending that you see on the oil projects, not really big project specific. It's all around the day-to-day type of what we'd call the MRO type of \u2013 normal type of spend. But capital budgets are definitely being curtailed by most oil and gas guys. There are companies within North America, both in Canada and the United States. And so they're continuing to tighten those belts up, and we're seeing that business and that day-to-day business given our strength in this marketplace, which has been hurting us more on what I would call the shorter-cycle type of products. And the project business, we haven't seen anything there. It's just been more the day-to-day type of situation. And that's been weakening here for the last couple months. And we anticipate that's going to continue for the rest of this year now, as most of the oil and gas companies reported here in the last couple weeks have talked about again slowing down some capital. And we're feeling that on the day-to-day type of spend. That's where we're seeing it. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And just on the flip side, given that oil has moved a bit back up, do you think that it actually will be down for the full year, or do you think there's the potential to actually see a lift before the fiscal year end? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I don't see a lift before the fiscal year. I think that the price of oil, I've talked about my opinion on the price of oil over the months here. I still think there's a chance that we could slip back in the $30s and then start trailing back up towards $50. You've got to see stability in the $50-plus range toward $60 and then a continued growth of demand, which we see today around the world, the demand for oil and gas. But clearly, the current pricing and the stress that companies are going through right now to make sure they right-size, they're not going to turn around in a month or two and say hey, okay, go ahead and spend. That's not going to happen. I think you're going to see the way we're looking at this marketplace right now is the first part of 2017 will continue to be challenging for our customer base. And they'll continue to be tight in places like North America, and they're going to be very, very tight relative to spending. And I just don't see that bounce back until probably later in 2017 or early 2018. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot, David. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you. Operator : We'll move now to Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Steve. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Just, Dave, you've talked a lot about the challenges in making the call for growth investments versus cuts and how to draw that line across the businesses, particularly when we're revisiting your guide. So where are you now in that thinking given how the market has been evolving and the more aggressive, it sounds like, achievement on the cost side that you guys have been getting? So when should we not be surprised about this pivot to growth investment? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think that we're starting to pivot to growth on the Commercial & Residential Solutions side already. We're looking at some unique technology investments here, both internally and through acquisitions. On the Automation side, so on the Commercial & Residential side, so I think you're going to start seeing, as we start talking about as we get into the quarters, that business continue to grow. I think that we are looking at unique investments to help grow that business more in 2017 and 2018. On the Automation side of the business right now, we're still going to go through \u2013 I would say continue to downsize and rationalize for some time here. One of the things as we form the two businesses, we're looking at ways that we can take out cost and create new investment dollars, some to go to margin, some to go internally. But that's going to be more in the 2017 \u2013 2018 time period. So I think you're looking at us already pivoting on part of the portfolio. And the automation part of the portfolio we are still rationalizing, restructuring, protecting profitability, and making sure that we do the right thing to protect the core value of the businesses. And so we're not walking away from the strategic investments there, but we're more in the let's make sure we have this opportunity to get the costs in line, and if we have any weak pieces of the tree and the wood, whatever it is, let's get it trimmed. And that's where we're at right now. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then it looks like \u2013 so you've got obviously flat growth guided for 3Q, and therefore implied flattish growth for 4Q underlying. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Correct. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So what does that mean for your assumptions around the MRO side, small to mid-size projects, because you did call it out again? I'm just still a little unclear on therefore what do we have to see happen for that to be achieved in the fourth quarter \u2013 sorry, for the rest of the year. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think what you need \u2013 we're seeing some \u2013 it depends on which segment you look at, Steve. I think that businesses are \u2013 just look at the business reporting in the economic reports. They're continuing to really curtail spending. And I think until you see businesses start then feeling comfortable that they can start stabilizing their capital spend versus cutting their capital spend, I think it's going to be a quarter-by-quarter fight in the U.S./North America region here. But we're already seeing some increase in Europe. We're already seeing it in Southeast Asia, but the key markets here in North America, they're still being pretty tight. So I think until we start hearing CEOs talk about expanding core capital investments for productivity, not capacity, but just for productivity and for some new products, I think it's going to be a slog. There's no doubt about it. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thanks. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you, Steve. Operator : Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi has the next question. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good afternoon, guys. Hi, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Andrew. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good afternoon. So your guidance for the year for China was down mid-single digits. Obviously, there has been some signs of stability, but GC (29:15) was still down 12%. So maybe you can talk about what you're seeing there and what you think for the rest of the year. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Our forecast is still to be in that mid-single digit, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8% down. From a comparison standpoint, this sucker really turned down hard in the second. I shouldn't call it a sucker, but I did. This market really turned down hard in the second half last year. We had down \u2013 if you think about the second half of 2015, our China destination sales were down probably around 16%; not probably, they were. In the first half of this year, they're down around 12% \u2013 13%. So what we're seeing is we're starting to see some pick back up in certain sectors, and comparisons will be a little bit easier. So if we go flat, it's still not real exciting given the fact how hard it was down last year. So that's what we see at this point in time. We see the second half being about the same pace, a little bit better, but coming off a lot easier comps because the second half of 2015 was down 16% \u2013 17%. So that's where we are right now. And we see that across some of the businesses where some of the day-to-day spending in Process is starting to happen. We're starting to see the refrigeration in some of the transportation market spending for Climate Technologies. We're seeing the data centers and telecom spending. So we're starting to see some level of improvement there. So I still think that we'll see on average the year being down 6%, 7%, 8% at this point in time unless there's been another shock, which we haven't seen yet. That's where we are right now. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. That's helpful, Dave. And then Process Management margin down a little bit in the quarter. You're obviously expecting a pretty weak first half of the year. But you do need a fairly steep increase to get to your high teens guidance for the year. So how realistic is that, and could you get there with your current plan? Is mix having a more unfavorable impact than you expected? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No, I think that Steve [Sonnenberg] and Mike and his whole team have done a phenomenal job of going after the costs, and they're working it very hard. So that cost is coming out very quickly. It started last year, and they've been aggressively after it. So we're going to start seeing more and more savings. They had a very good second quarter profitability, as I saw it, and I think that we're starting to see that flow through. Now we are concerned about the North America I would say weakness because that is a very profitable business for us. But they still have other actions they can take to protect that profitability, and we are set pretty comfortable relative to the whole year, that range we gave you I think back in February. And so I still feel pretty good about that. I think we're reasonably on track. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks, Dave. I appreciate it. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome, take care. Operator : And let's move now to Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Hello, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, hello. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon to you, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good afternoon. I just wanted to start with Industrial Automation. You talked about pricing pressure in the slides. I think that may be new, so maybe any color around that. And also, are you seeing particularly heavy destocking or something because the order trend is not really improving it looked like February to March? So just maybe give some color on different verticals within that. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: The big issue there is we have the mix going on from the standpoint of pricing pressure, profitability pressures. The other big issue is our alternator business in North America and parts of Europe has been extremely weak and taken a nosedive down. And so that's been a big issue for us. As that continues to weaken \u2013 and they're basically at this point in time seeing very weak end market demand, our customers, and so our guys are continuing to ratchet back down. We're getting to the point right now to the pace that's getting low enough, but it's ugly from the standpoint there's not much volume going on. That's where we are at this point in time, in a very \u2013 I mean depth of the cycle. And it took another notch down the last couple months. And I think we're getting really close and we should start seeing some improvement in momentum back up through that. And that's where we are at this time. And again, they continue to take costs out. It's a tough cycle right now for these guys. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Understood. And then just overall, companywide, I think in February you talked about a $335 million savings number for this year, if there's any detail you could give on how much of that was recognized in the first half. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And maybe any sense, when you look at the restructuring plans for the next six months, any color you could give on how much you might be carrying into next year. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. Now the number we gave you was what, $350 million for the year, you said? Is that what you said? Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): $335 million. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: $335 million? Right now we're probably just a tad better than that right now given the second half of the year from the restructuring and the benefits that we're seeing from that. So as we look at the pieces, these are the actual numbers, these aren't the deltas, correct? I'm looking at a sheet here. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Those are the deltas. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: These are deltas. So in the first quarter, we're at a delta here of around $80 million improved from restructuring. Second quarter we're looking at around $100 million. The third quarter, it looks to us like it's going to be probably back around $70 million because now we started to get some comparisons from last year. And then in the fourth quarter, what happens here is we'll see it bounce back up again, probably to over $100 million because the expense is going to be down. So the delta there is going to help us a little bit. So that's how the numbers look right now. And we just had a very good quarter here. I would expect us to have another decent quarter in the third quarter, and then we'll get a big pop because there will be less spending versus last year, which we had a big pickup. So the savings are starting to flow through along those lines. Next year, now I would say based just on the core businesses left, let's say that we're executing the sale or the spin or whatever of the businesses. You look at the Process business and you look at the Commercial & Residential business left and just the day-to-day restructuring. Those numbers are going to drop significantly because of what's going on. And so when I say significantly, we're going to be under $50 million. I haven't seen the number yet, but I've got to believe it's going to be under $50 million. And then what's going to happen, though, is Bob Sharp and Jim Lindemann are looking at opportunities across the Commercial & Residential Solutions business that we are going to start executing on as we get into 2017. So there all of a sudden \u2013 we don't have a number yet but we're going start taking that number up. Where that $50 million may be comfortable, we might go up $25 million, $30 million, $40 million, as we look at a two-year program to right-size and restructure and reposition the Commercial & Residential on a global basis to make it really best cost location, best cost structure, and allow us to take some of that profitability to the P&L and also to help us invest for growth. So there are some unique opportunities now that we've put these businesses together, and so that will happen as we get into 2017. But next year restructuring, my gut tells me the core basis will be down significantly. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great, thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's a long-winded answer for probably what you didn't want to hear. But that's... Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): No, that's great. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. Operator : And now we'll hear from Mike Wood with Macquarie Capital. Michael Wood - Macquarie Securities : Hi, good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Hey, Mike. Michael Wood - Macquarie Securities : I think of Emerson as particularly dominant in the larger projects in Process, Industrial Automation. And you're calling out in some of your remarks hope for the smaller, medium-sized projects in MRO, in Process, for example. I'm just curious if you can give us some color in terms of how that may shift market shares or what you're doing to work on the share in the smaller-sized, medium-sized projects? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: From our perspective, we've been really pushing resources because there's not as many large, large, large projects out there right now. So we redirect our resources back into the small and medium-sized projects to pick up that business because you're right. If you look at our share, we go very high to large. We're very, very strong in the day-to-day. In the middle, we're probably the weakest, as you said. So we've been shifting some of the resources down from the large down to the medium and go after those \u2013 off to the smaller projects. From growth in market share, I still feel that we're going to end up \u2013 we'll come out of this cycle ahead. As we did the last cycle, I think Emerson will come out ahead. And we'll be a stronger player in the Process Management industrial marketplace around this space here when the cycle comes out from overall participation. On the day-to-day stuff, that's being more driven by the corporate world of CEOs being very cautious, worried about cash flow, doing the same thing I'm doing if you look at Emerson. If you look at our capital spending in the first half of the year, we're down significantly from last year. I don't think I'm any different from any other CEO out there, and I think that CEOs right now are being very, very cautious relative to spending, and particularly given they keep seeing weakness emerging in the industrial space. So I think that part is going to be pretty challenging here for the next six months until CEOs feel okay, I can let go of a little bit more money and reinvest back into the company. That's how I see it at this point in time. Michael Wood - Macquarie Securities : Got it. And also, you called out the efficiency productivity investments in Process. Where are we in that investment cycle? Is it just beginning? And I'm curious why we don't see that in Industrial Automation in some of those efficiency investments. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Boy, if I could read everyone's mind, I'd be okay there. I think that we are seeing that both on the Automation side and the Process side in Europe. We're starting to see it where Western Europe did not invest for some time, and now they're doing it. They're going after it. We're starting to see a little bit of that in Asia-Pacific. In North America, people are just being very, very tight with capital right now. Even though money is cheap, free almost, people are very, very cautious at this point in time relative to spending a lot of capital. We're very focused in our capital spend right now on productivity, quality improvement, and trying to get the costs down, but a lot of people are still trying to evaluate where they want to take their businesses. I think there has been an underinvestment, and hopefully we'll see it come back up in the old productivity and improving your efficiency and operations in North America. I'm a little bit disappointed to watch corporate America cutting too far in that area. But that's where they are right now, and I can't push and shove any more to make them do it. I know what we're doing, and we've redirected heavily the capital we're spending. We're spending less capital, but it's all tied basically to efficiency and productivity and how do we get lower costs for the future. Michael Wood - Macquarie Securities : Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Operator : We'll move now to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon. Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So, Dave, I just wanted to square your comments on orders bottoming in Process and the fact that things are getting weaker in oil and gas. One of the things that you mentioned in your slides was that the power markets have been getting better, and we've heard that from a few different people as well. So maybe is that the reason why you feel better about the orders bottoming on the Process business? And what specifically are you guys seeing in the power markets? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: The Process business, I look around the world. The one place that we've seen increased weakness is this U.S. day-to-day type of spending. That's the one area I see the weakness. The rest of world has continued to start increasing their investments in what I'd call the day-to-day productivity type investments. We're seeing that spending going on. If I look at the order pace in Europe and I look at the order pace in Asia, that trend is turning the right way. So that's why we felt pretty good. The one surprise we had is in the last couple months we've seen the U.S. spending rate come back down again, which bothers us. And that's what's created probably this delay by one month relative to April, the April target, which we have \u2013 I don't know yet for sure, but just intuition tells me where we were at negative 4% that should have been closer to negative 2%. So what's going on right now is this is climbing up a little bit slower, and we're having people be a little more cautious in spending. But on the power side, people are having to spend money for the new regulations coming into play. They've underinvested for a while. They have some plants they've had to take offline, and so we're seeing people spend money on trying to move towards gas. And so the spending is there for power and we're aggressively seeing that. We're doing extremely well in Europe. We're doing well in North America, and we'll doing well in Asia. We are a company that has actually continued to invest and grow and put new technology in. A lot of our competitors are walking away from what I call primary power. And so be it, I love it. We'll gladly make those investments for people. And so we've been investing from technology and innovation and acquisitions, and a lot of companies in our space that we compete against are actually deemphasizing it and walking away from it. Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And maybe to follow up there on the oil and gas piece, have you started to see any weakness in midstream? I know that's one area that you guys have called out as being pretty strong for you. Is that attributing to some of the weaker oil and gas spending? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No, midstream is fine. I think there might be an element going on. We could be seeing some cannibalization going on. As you know, there was a lot of investments that were done that's sitting out there, used equipment, maybe equipment that was never put in place. There could be an element of that, people going back and digesting and cannibalizing that right now. But clearly, something has happened to create people to back off. Maybe they found a warehouse of stuff that they had purchased for some investments. But clearly they're backed off and so they're using some older equipment or some equipment they found, and that's all that's going on at this point in time. Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, thanks. I'll get back in queue. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you. Operator : We'll move on to Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good afternoon, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon. I thought we cut you out of the queue. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Our usual bet, Mortimer? Just kidding. So in any event, in terms of April versus May, given the fact that you've maintained your guidance, it really doesn't matter. And obviously the restructuring benefits have definitely kicked in. But do you feel good, it's just a matter of... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Is it Bob, Rob? Norm (44:30) won't get any dinner for two weeks if we don't get April, so he's out there working his ass off right now. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: But do you think it's a question of you'll start to see that kind of nice pull-through in May \u2013 June timeframe? And how are you thinking about how \u2013 do you feel like the year from this perspective, given the restructuring benefits you've gotten and the most all margin conversion is well intact here? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I'm looking at Frank. I think we feel good about the profitability right now because I think the operations and I think I know the operations are really, we got on this last year starting real early and they've worked it and we've kept the pace. And as you know, we haven't really slipped off the spending or the savings, and it's really starting to flow through. So we feel good about that. I feel a little bit more worried about sales because of the U.S. marketplace in particular. I feel better about Europe, as you can tell. I feel a little bit nervous about Latin America because I still think these guys are still struggling. But the U.S., this I would say slow to start turning that nose up really bothers me. But I would say that within the forecast we've given out there for sales, we're still comfortable, but it's probably a little lower than it was below. But I feel good about the profitability from the Power because that's happening. And so it's just we have some markets going our way, some markets are not going that way, and they're not all turning at the same time. And so that's where we are at this point in time. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Admittedly, a very strong quarter on margins and free cash flow generation. I don't think anybody can debate that. The final question I have is just following up I think on Scott's earlier question around the timing of M&A, and there are probably limits to what you can talk about this. But obviously, there's a certain decile of deals that you'd have to use equity for. Would that delay the timing? Do you have to get this exit out of the way before you would consider using equity? Is there a gating factor there? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No, we don't see it as an issue there. The deals we're working on right now are probably not going to be cash deals. We could do billions of dollars in cash right now. That's not an issue. We've got an ample balance sheet. The operations have got \u2013 they've got the liquidity back in, they've got the working capital back in line. Our profitability is coming up. So I think from the type of deals we're seeing at this point in time we're looking at \u2013 and not some big strategic \u2013 I don't see us moving that way until we exit these other two businesses. But we see opportunities of multiple billion-dollar type opportunities that we could do internally right now just with pure cash. So we've got the position to do that. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So for a large deal, really that's the gating factor is exiting Network Power, okay. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Right. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Take care, Rob. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. Operator : And now we'll move on to Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Hi, Chris. Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, Dave and Frank. So you undercut our nosier questions about the portfolio of Process. But could you just sum up the run rates of Leroy Control and I think it's maybe ClosetMaid combined, how they're contributing this year? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Leroy, I would say that Leroy Control Techniques are struggling this year. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: $1.5 billion \u2013 $1.6 billion. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes, they're what you call sales there. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: It was $1.7 billion the prior year, but I would say it's probably down to $1.5 billion. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Around $1.5 billion. Profit margin is down a little bit. ClosetMaid I would say is probably somewhat flat. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: The margins are somewhat flat this year. So there's not \u2013 and we're not really taking any action on ClosetMaid at this point in time. But I would say Leroy-Somer Control Techniques have not seen the recovery that we thought originally. That business, the backup power area in industrial spending has been much weaker, though we're starting to see the improvements in Europe in that area and some improvement in Asia. So hopefully, we're getting to the bottom of this from a cycle standpoint, but it's been a tough run for these guys for the last couple years. Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And with the Industrial Automation segment and your orders and business run rate, are you seeing any issue on customer commitments ahead of the question of who's going to own these properties? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No, no, they trust that we're going to do the right thing. Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, and then last one on Network Power. You called out the importance of new channels and solutions allowing better winning out there in the marketplace. Already seeing big improvements this year, but you also commented on a long way to go, so I'm wondering if you've now established the guide path for another big step up in profitability here for the segment. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We expect the profitability \u2013 the business used to run 10%-plus type of profitability, and so the goal is to get that back above that. And so as this business continues, the restructuring is getting closer and closer. I think they've gotten the majority of their restructuring done. They probably have a little bit left in the second half of this year. But from the underlying profit, when the growth comes, these guys are going to leverage quite nicely. So I expect them to see pretty good growth in the second half of the year and improvement in profitability in the second half of the year, both from growth and then also from improvement in the cost structure. Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Operator : We'll move now to Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, Dave, just on the restructuring, it sounds like it's tracking according to plan and everything, but the first half was only $28 million of expense. Just conceptually, I'm trying to figure out why that would be a back half loaded restructuring plan. It seems like you know what you need to do and you'd be getting after it earlier in the year. Can you just maybe explain what's going on there? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We're doing some significant restructuring, some challenging restructuring in Europe, and you have to do it at a very measured pace. That's one of the issues right there. And so it's a plan that you try to get it done within 12 months; sometimes it takes 14 months. Our European process for restructuring is one that you want to do very carefully to get it done without major disruption and major problems with your workforce. So a lot of it is around that European situation. North America is a little bit easier, and that's pretty straightforward. But we have some restructuring underway in Europe that we well-planned out, and we might miss a month or two here as we push around. So that's what's going on at this point in time. The other thing we're doing at this point in time is also MEA. They are getting their restructuring done and they're actually getting it done at a little lower cost. They're getting their profit. They're getting it done, which is nice to see. If you do it with a measured pace, you actually get it done at a better cost structure and get the work done and it costs us less. But I still think we're going to be doing it around this $60 million \u2013 $70 million this year. And again, as I said, we're looking at some of the Process and Industrial area right now because there's some more incremental things we need to do to be properly positioned as we go into I would say a challenging first half of 2017 at this point in time. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, thanks, and maybe just one more follow-up on the M&A angle. Clearly, as you mentioned, you have the financial strength to do what you want to do. Organizationally, there's been \u2013 obviously, you're undergoing some big changes and also some management has moved around within the businesses. Organizationally, are you in a position where you would want to do something sizable? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes, we're ready to go. We're ready to go. From the restructuring, by the time you start the process \u2013 I mean the restructuring, a lot of it will be well behind you as you get \u2013 our acquisitions don't happen in one day or two days. So if you do the process, I think that we're well-positioned as we go into the second half of this calendar year to take on some additional. And if we can pick up couple billion dollars worth of things, then we'd be very excited about that. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : All right, thanks a lot. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Operator : At this time, we will move to Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Josh. How do you pronounce your last name? Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Not like that, we'll try Pokrzywinski next time. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. I just wanted to make sure I didn't \u2013 I thought I knew who you were. I thought maybe you got a name change or something. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: I'm trying to revert to old country where we're nationalizing here ahead of any trouble. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We just nationalized? I didn't know that. Thank you, Josh, all pun intended there. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: On Network Power, you called off some of the project strength in Europe, but you sound a bit more sanguine on the business in general. If I pulled out some of this project activity in Europe, which sounds chunky and maybe some detail on when that ends as well, but how do you feel about the other regions going forward or what you're seeing today? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Network Power in total is doing reasonably well across the world. That industry does go \u2013 we've got a couple months we're on and then you have a pause. But generally, we're pretty pleased in the last couple months, and it's reasonably broad-based. So we'll see how April comes in. Our anticipation of April is that we have high single-digit order pace. And I think it would be interesting to see which regions come into play again. So if we get a high single-digit order pace in that space, then that means \u2013 that's more than one or two dots. Let's put it that way. So we'll see. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: How far does the European project activity take you out? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Our European project right now is working on the second half \u2013 we work out second half calendar year. So what we're booking right now is really going to start helping us in the second half of this year. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got you. And just to revisit the April \u2013 May order dynamic here, and maybe one month doesn't make a difference, but it does sound like you're talking about a bit more caution in the business. I guess versus three months ago, clearly easier comps get you a lot of the way, and stability would get you to positive order intake by that April \u2013 May timeframe. But did you actually see orders come in below where you would have thought, comp aside, just a daily order rate? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: What we saw was, as I was talking earlier on the phone call or in my initial comments would be the U.S./North America oil and gas day-to-day business was weaker than we would have anticipated. On the positive side, Network Power is a little bit stronger. I would say also \u2013 I would say that our order pace in China and some of the other businesses I thought would maybe be a little bit better, but it didn't quite trend that way yet. But I would say the primary reasons I look at the order pace is the North America capital type of spend market, day-to-day marketplace, was weaker the last three or four months. That's probably what's created the slowdown. If you look at the line, it still continued to drift up. It should have drifted a little bit faster the last two months, but it's on a curve now. It's one month behind where I thought it would be. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: So maybe a bit more of a bathtub shaped recovery here versus anything else? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes, exactly. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: All right, great. Thanks, guys. See you at EPG. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome, see you. Operator : We'll move along to Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Good afternoon, Dave and everyone. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Jeff. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hey, a couple questions. Maybe we could drill into China a little bit more and resi HVAC in particular. We've seen some mixed data there, Dave. Do you think you have any particular market share issue going on there, or is there anything to point out beyond just the challenging macro? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No, I don't think so from a residential standpoint. We're not as much of a residential \u2013 it depends on how we mean it. The high-end residential we'd be a player there. But I would say our core markets, our core customer right now just went into a situation with too much inventory, and they're having to deal with that. And the rest, if you look at the rest of China, it's been pretty good for our residential business \u2013 or not, for our commercial, our residential business and the climate business, but there's not much going on there. It's just that market goes in pockets. These guys will go two and three quarters, they buy heavily, and then they overstock and then they cut back. So nothing unusual there at this point in time. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And just back to the portfolio one more time. I appreciate you've crossed the line in terms of planning and strategic thinking afore to where you want to be. But if you really do have the capability to do things on the buy side, so to speak, without getting these deals done, do you really want to be selling these IA [Industrial Automation] businesses in an environment where you're saying they're nose-diving into an 11-year bottom? Does that make sense? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I said one piece of it was at an 11-year bottom, and I don't think I used the word nose-diving. But I would say that at this point in time, if we feel we can get the right type of cash out of this asset, then we will monetize it and move on. How long it takes for some of these assets to come back in certain cycles, we have things we want to do relative to repositioning, so we want to get on with it and do it rather than sit there and manage it. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then on the Network Power side then too, I guess you are alluding to some strategic interest then if you look at maybe finding a buyer or taking longer for an approval process. Are you seeing some actual strategic interest as opposed to just maybe private equity type of interest for that business? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think there have been press releases on this but strategic interest out there? And the answer is yes, there is strategic interest out there. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great, thanks, see you in a couple weeks. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: See you in a couple weeks. Operator : At this time, we'll move to Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, just to stay on Network Power on that last point, sale or spin, and maybe there's some nuance here that I don't appreciate. But my understanding is to qualify for a tax-free spin, you cannot have had substantive conversations with outside parties about a sale. So I'm not sure how you can have both these conversations and still have a tax-free spin. So what am I missing? Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Deane, I think those rules \u2013 this is Frank. Hi. I think that's specific to a specific party, so that if you were to have conversations with a specific party and then spin it and then subsequently they buy it, then you'd have an issue with the tax-free nature of the spin. It is not a general prohibition against having conversations with parties as you spin the company. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. So that has not been breached then? Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: No. We're very, very careful about how we're going about this. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. And people know that if they have a conversation with us and then they do go to certain levels and then they back off and then they wait for a spin, they have a problem. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it, all right. I appreciate that clarification. And then as a follow-up then, Dave, you surprised us last quarter when you went back into the guidance business, quarterly guidance business, and you're surprising here again with not a range, but a point estimate. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's an approximate point, approximately. Approximately could be a range. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yes, but that squiggle, I'm seeing the $0.85. But the idea there is it suggests pretty good precision and visibility into the outlook. And so we can't even say where the assumptions on the high end and the low end, but just what's changed in terms of giving you this additional visibility? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: When I say approximately, I mean probably within a nickel. So I'd give you my sense right there from that standpoint. I just think that \u2013 I want to make sure that people understand on the projection we're on from the standpoint of watching people have a tougher time figure out where things are trending, I want to make sure that people understood where we are. So I'm going to make it very clear. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Is it a top line that would provide that range, the high and low? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And would it be U.S. change? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: What I said earlier, our cost reduction, our profitability is running at very good levels. If you look at the underlying conversion that we had in the last several quarters, it's been getting better. And then you look at the slower climb out on order pace will create \u2013 clearly putting some pressure on us where we think the top line will be. If the top line was a little bit stronger, then clearly our profitability would go higher and our EPS would go higher. Right now, we're more concerned about the top line sales than we are the profitability because we've got our cost structure in line right now. I feel good about that. We feel good about that. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Understood, thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Operator : We'll take the final question from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Hello, Rick. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: What are you doing? Are you all busy today? Are you working something hard today? Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Trying to, pretending at least. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You work pretty hard. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : A couple for me. In terms of, Dave, you alluded to your expectation around oil prices may be pulling back a little bit. Should we think of the back half guidance being sub-$40 in terms of your assumption from a sales standpoint as it relates to...? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No, I don't think right now \u2013 I think the day-to-day sales are pretty much set. It's not price of oil driven. I just happen to be one of these guys \u2013 you know me, Rich. I put stakes in the ground. I put a stake in the ground back in November about April. How many people do things like that? It's just my nature. And so my feel right now, I've always told you that I always felt that price always would run up, would run down a couple times. I fundamentally believe there's a chance it could run back down again into the $30s. I personally believe by the time we get into the fourth calendar quarter this year we'll be around that $50 mark. That's where I think things are going. People are cutting back. The demand is still growing, but it takes a long time. When you make an investment and you have oil and gas pumping and you've got that capital spend, you don't just turn it off. Typically, you let it run and try and make some cash out of it. Even though you're not making as much as you thought, you're still trying to get that payback. I think that's what we're going through right now. We're still squeezing it out. And I think there could be a bump in the road here down, but fundamentally I think the trend line is back up a little bit towards the $50 mark. And it doesn't make much difference in the next three or four months in sales. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Right, okay. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Volume in sales. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right, fair enough. And then... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean you make calls, I make calls, you know? Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Right, exactly. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Here you go. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And then on U.S. HVAC, so you had a good quarter and the sell-in data has been very good and the manufacturing data has been a little bouncy. So how do you feel about inventories right now, and you're expecting a good fiscal Q3. Any risks around that based on what you're seeing out there? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Nothing right now. The channels move up and down. I think that it could have had a couple months where construction wasn't as strong as people did and the inventories being built. Right now, it looks like things are pretty well balanced and the order pace is pretty good in North America. So I would expect us to have a decent third quarter in North America. And depending how hot it gets is how much liquidation goes out and how much you have to build later in the year, which will be a good thing for us. So we'll see what happens now. Right now, it's setting up to be a decent year for us in North America and a decent year for us in Europe and in some of the other parts of the marketplace. But it's good to see. It's good to see. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : If it's the normal weather, you feel pretty good about the growth trend. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I feel pretty good about it. I'm not too worried about that segment right now. I'm not hearing anybody jumping up and down at this point. Frank, do you hear anybody jumping up and down? Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: No. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Frank just shook his head. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: I think we're in pretty good shape there. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: And if Frank doesn't jump up and down and shake his head, we're okay. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. I'll see you in a couple weeks. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay, good. Thanks. I want to thank everybody for their time today. Again, operations, outstanding job in execution. I thank Frank and Ed and Ed and everybody out there working with the operation guys to get this done. And we clearly continue to pivot towards the repositioning. And our goal is to come out, as we talked about in the February investor meeting, come out a little bit smaller company, more profitable company but quickly add on acquisitions to use the money we're going to generate here to invest in the growth again and get this company back above $20 billion with a 19% to 20% EBIT margin, so a very good business. So that thank you very much, and you all have a great summer. Bye. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation.",

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Emerson's Investor Conference Call. During today's presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. This conference is being recorded today, August 2, 2016. Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Craig Rossman, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead. Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you, Renee. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Katherine Button Bell, Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's third quarter 2016 results and also provide an update on Emerson's business transformation. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website at emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. I will start with the third quarter summary as shown on page two of the slide presentation. Net sales in the quarter decreased 7% versus the prior year to $5.1 billion, with underlying sales down 5%. The third quarter results reflected the continuation of challenging demand conditions in our key served markets. Oil and gas spending, both capital investment and operational expenditures, remained at significantly depressed levels. Automation markets in North America have been extremely challenging, as anticipated improvements in spending did not materialize as we had forecast. Data center and telecommunications infrastructure demand continue to be favorable, while global air conditioning and refrigeration and U.S. construction markets were mixed. The trailing three-month orders for June were down 6.7% on a GAAP basis, with underlying trends down 4.4% excluding approximately 2% for currency translation. Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes $37 million of separation cost, decreased 5% to $0.80. Reported earnings per share were $0.74. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $718 million. Turning to slide three, despite lower than expected sales, EBIT margin increased 20 basis points versus the prior year driven by benefits from restructuring actions and solid operational execution within our businesses. No additional shares were repurchased during the quarter; and separation costs were significantly lower than expected. Turning to slide four, underlying sales decreased in all regions except Europe. The results by region were similar to the second quarter as the global environment for business investment remains challenging. Turning to slide five, total segment margin was up 50 basis points to 16% as three segments reported improved margins. Both the Climate Technology and Commercial & Residential Solutions segments reported up margins despite lower volumes. And improved cost structure resulted in operating cash flow of $718 million in the quarter. Capital spending continues to be reduced, in line with overall business conditions. Turning to slide six, Process Management underlying sales decreased 13% in the quarter. Energy spending, particularly in North America, continues to be reduced as customers evaluate the stability of current oil and gas prices, while power and life sciences markets continue to provide growth. Restructuring programs will be further increased in response to weak demand conditions from global oil and gas customers and the expectation that weaker conditions will continue into 2017. Segment margin decreased 290 basis points primarily due to a sharp volume reduction and the resulting deleverage, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions. Turning to slide seven, Industrial Automation third quarter underlying sales declined 11%, reflecting continued weakness in industrial spending and upstream oil and gas capital investments, while wind projects remain favorable for the drives business. Segment margin decreased 110 basis points primarily due to volume deleverage and price, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment. Mixed demand forecasts among the businesses are expected to result in improved levels of sales and profitability in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide eight, Network Power underlying sales increased 10% in the quarter as strong order trends in both data center and telecommunications infrastructure markets translated into positive growth. Sales increased in all regions except Europe, which reflected a difficult comparison to the prior year from large project revenues. Segment margin improved 550 basis points to 9.1%, driven by volume leverage and savings from restructuring actions. Benefits from restructuring actions and new product programs support the expectation for continued margin improvement in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide nine, Climate Technology's underlying sales decreased 1% in the quarter as decreases in Asia and the Middle East more than offset increases in other regions. Underlying sales growth in North America and Europe reflected low-single digit growth in both the air conditioning and commercial refrigeration businesses. Segment margin increased 270 basis points to 22.4%, primarily due to savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment, partially offset by lower pricing. The near term outlook for global demand in our served market supports the expectation for modest sales growth in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide 10, underlying sales in the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment decreased 1% as growth in food waste disposers was offset by declines in all other businesses, which were impacted by customer-driven inventory reductions. Segment margin improved 380 basis points to 24.4%, reflecting the impact of the divestiture, savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment. Modest levels of underlying growth are expected in the fourth quarter as we anticipate favorable conditions in U.S. construction to continue and channel inventory reduction should be complete. Turning to slide 11. Earlier today, we announced agreements to sell our Network Power, Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques businesses for a combined value of $5.2 billion, which is in line with the guidance we provided at our February Investor Conference. These agreements represent a significant step forward in the overall portfolio repositioning strategy we announced last year in June. And with these agreements now in place, the strategic repositioning squarely focuses on acquisitions within our core platforms of Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential Solutions, as Emerson management and the board determine how best to redeploy the cash proceeds from these divestitures. Turning to slide 12. The third quarter results continue to reflect the low growth global environment facing our businesses today; and the outlook remains challenging as markets will continue to be impacted by reduced levels of investment spending, weaker global economics and political uncertainty. Considering these conditions, coupled with the fact that anticipated improvement in order trends did not materialize, the company now expects fiscal year underlying sales to be down 5% to 6% excluding currency translation and an impact from completed divestitures of approximately 2% each. Adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal year are now expected to be $2.90 to $3, excluding $200 million to $250 million of separation costs and a fourth quarter loss of approximately $100 million related to the agreements to sell Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques. I will now turn the presentation over to Kathy to talk about our business transformation. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Before we do that, this is David Farr, I want to first thank Greg for the update in the quarter. Secondly, Kathy \u2013 I'm going to introduce Kathy. Kathy has been engaged for a little bit over a year now relative to what we refer to generally as the new Emerson. There's a lot of work that has to be done relative to the communication to our investors, communication to our customers, communication to our employees. And Kathy has taken on this assignment with her team and several people from the various businesses that will still be part of Emerson going forward; and she's creating a new presentation of what Emerson means going forward. And so, what we want to do today, given the announcement of the transaction to sell Network Power and the transaction to sell Leroy-Somer and CT, I wanted Kathy to go through and share with the investors and the outside people what we're seeing as we go forward and we'll be formally announcing in early October. So I've asked Kathy to talk to investors today and give you an insight to that. And, Kathy, the floor is yours. Thank you. Katherine Button Bell - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm positive you're all anxious to hear from Dave, so I will try to use your incredibly valuable time with great care and sensitivity. It is clear to me that I am merely the warm-up band and you're eager to get the main act. Today, we're going to briefly discuss how we're applying our marketing expertise to better redefine our great company to accelerate change, drive growth and imagine a different future. I believe you've already witnessed some highly tangible efforts of this, this morning. Go to page two. Although today is about moving your view beyond our financial pie chart, this particular one holds all the excitement about our new possibilities. This demonstrates how we're adapting to a new reality utilizing our already industry leadership position in adjacent markets and driving our single source end-to-end solutions. Go to page three. This is not revolutionary for an already well-managed and financially strong company. We are on our 126-year-old journey of complexity reduction and perpetual integration of our businesses. We're driving efficiencies through a tighter brand, which would deliver more collaboration and more customer focus, resulting in more integrated solutions innovation between our businesses. We're, therefore, more capable of cross-leveraging our remaining portfolio and making it easier for all to navigate our business. Slide four. So we need to accelerate past our previous transformations, evolving our business and our messaging from doing many things to concentrating our efforts on the critical challenges facing our customers, specifically in the process, industrial, commercial and residential markets. For Automation Solutions, this means being the most trusted partner and problem solver for our customers during the current business crisis for them. This also becomes a showcase for our Internet of Things initiatives as we build on our legacy of long-term success of network intelligence in the field via our groundbreaking PlantWeb technology and our unmatched wireless heritage. For our Commercial & Residential business, we can focus on the global criticality of human comfort, connected home, food quality, advancing energy efficiency at home and work, as well as sustainability. Slide five. As conglomerates have fallen out of favor, we've quickly transitioned to a more highly focused enterprise. The best example of this is the new emerson.com debuting on October 1. But all of our communications, both internal and outside, will reflect and promote our new positioning. Talent acquisition migrates from fragmented business units to an Emerson career-centric approach. Our social media has historically been product brand focused and now we're trying to expose our deep industry expertise and to humanize our brand. Finally, advertising, which previously portrayed us as wide and deep now can support two major businesses in their our own deep special expertise. Slide six. So a great example of this was our truly unexpected foundational sponsorship of CERAWeek, which, as you probably know, is the Davos meeting of the oil and gas industry. As we were developing our new Emerson Automation Solutions positioning, this seemed like a great opportunity to dramatically demonstrate our leadership position in the industry and launch our unique and desperately needed approach for the oil and gas businesses facing a crucial moment in their troubled marketplace. Top quartile solutions were a breakthrough approach for a vulnerable industry and we tried to optimize our moment in the sun. Slide seven. We poured exceptional effort and assets into the Houston-based event with full immersion media and social media training for all the Emerson executives, as we drove a full frontal media approach of the city, venue and with all the participants. The extraordinary results are the positive outcome of tightly choreographed messaging strategy, as well as very well-prepared executives. This is Emerson at its best, applying full energy and singular focus. Slide eight. For Emerson's newly combined Commercial & Residential Solutions business, the opening of our new Helix Innovation Center in Dayton offered a similarly tightly focused media and promotional event that was designed to showcase the advantages that's closely aligned with those businesses. Innovation Center clearly demonstrates our unique research capabilities around energy efficiency, connected homes and businesses in a real-time simulated environment. This miraculously includes a fully built-in IKEA furnished house; a commercial kitchen, which serves the entire Dayton campus with catering and a convenience store. This all exists under a single roof and allows for monitoring and research under an exceptional array of climate, environment and variable conditions. Slide nine. From a marketing viewpoint, like CERAWeek, the opening of the Helix allowed for a wildly focused media event. We continued our highly publicized STEM support initiative with a survey on the issues of STEM education. For you financial guys, STEM is the acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. We again tapped Internet science superstar, Hank Green, in the backdrop of our Innovation Center on the University of Dayton campus. It was media magic. We showcased our engineering initiatives and allowed Hank to do his storytelling sorcery to millions of network viewers, social media networkers and even thousands of potential investors. This was astonishingly successful for a B2B initiative, where media interest was stoked by the authentic connected story of STEM careers, sustainable research, a science geek and a real university setting. This is not just another product launch event. Slide 10. As we all know, digital access and transparency has changed all of our business lives forever. We also know that an extraordinary amount of research and private exploration goes on long before a salesman is invited to the party. Your website is the window to your company's soul and undoubtedly has the ability to expose one's capability to better explain, as well as execute one's business. Most multi-billion dollar companies cannot unify and face the challenge of reconstituting their digital presence. The unique inflection point of today's divestitures have swung open an opportunity to begin again. We've been working for 12 months on Phase 1 of our new web presence to launch single taxonomy, single product catalogue, single technology approach, resulting in mobile always, all glass (16:50) responsive design. This will result in a cleaner, portable, searchable new emerson.com. It will take us two more years to complete the technology transition; keep, kill, edit and vent (17:03). We had over 700,000 pages in our previous environment, but we will be at the very least a more nimble, unified player. This is the one thing I believe our competitors would not expect from us and would fear the most; a better more truly (17:20) integrated Emerson. Slide 11. So Dave has generously allowed me to give you a 3.5-minute cook's tour of the emerson.com prototype. This is giving you all a sneak preview into our Phase 1 of the new site. I think you will find it as a new vision of our streamlined tightly focused selves, exemplifying enduring strength and adaptability to change as we rise to the new challenge. Please bear with me, as we thought it was technically safer to videotape the prototype as it is a little jumpy and we didn't want to take you out of the webcast. Here is emerson.com. Please roll the video. [Video Presentation] (18:00). There they go. Okay. The front page is dedicated to introducing our clean design, inviting customers to explore, career seekers to learn and investors to fall in love all over again. It is meant to be a showcase of our great stories and a window to our values. The new site is an exceptional initiative to bust our silos and unify our businesses. In usability research, our customers said it was beautiful, complete and visually appealing and that the images highlight the breadth of our industries and humanize our brands. As we move to About Us, you'll see we introduce our visitors to our transformation story. This describes how we plan to increase value to both our customers and shareholders with our tight focus on two major business segments. Our realignment is about accelerated cultural change inside, customer joy outside and value creation for all. As we wind our visitors down the page, they will encounter a new Social Responsibility Report, access to our educational I Love STEM page, our much more extensive Join Our Team careers section. I'm also very proud of our more extensive social channel selector, (19:46) which you'll see from Twitter to YouTube we are ready to connect. Finally, we head to our Investors happy home. Our Investors page is meant to be a familiar, but improved user experience for all of you. Roll over resources, back year Annual Reports, profiles and SEC filings are at your mouse tip. Finally, an up-to-the-minute mergers and acquisition updates section will be available, but not currently available in our 30-day-old prototype. Emerson Automation Solutions is the doorway to our ever-broadening offering in the industrial and process industries. We immediately discuss capital projects, operational efficiency and tour our Internet of Things offering on a global scalable level. Our site is founded on an industry-centric approach, allowing us to better explain our end-to-end solutions with an industry view. Our world-famous signature brands are still prominent and easily searchable, so every customer can still reach each SKU by bookmark, new easy search and relatable discovery. The Emerson Commercial & Residential Solutions business introduces us to the unified concept of optimized performance for connected buildings with energy control. All our products and services form the basis for many cohesive growth opportunities based on connected equipment, home and business monitoring, energy efficient improvement and infrastructure support. World-class signature brands like RIGID, Sensi and InSinkErator form the basis for scalable solutions and are the bedrock of this B2B business and our only B2C empire. As I introduced earlier, the Helix is the metaphor for our Commercial & Residential businesses. Our five simulated environments are almost impossible to appreciate from a distance, as the building offers us the ability to control the external environment \u2013 think winter in Alaska, summer in Dubai \u2013 in order to measure the energy efficiency or the home or business inside. Our Innovation Center has been a terrific real-life laboratory with some of Emerson's most impressive, sustainable innovations, like InSinkErator's Grind2Energy, food waste initiatives to Sensi Wi-Fi Thermostats and groundbreaking compressor health control. So thank you very much for your time and attention, and I will hand it back to Dave Farr. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much, Kathy. I appreciate your time. I wanted the shareholders to understand, the investors to understand, where we're trying to take the company going forward. A lot of work will be undertaken here the next 60 days as we get ready to launch. It is very important for our employees and our customers to understand what we're trying to do with Emerson and reposition the company into these two core business units. Clearly, a little over a year ago, we announced our repositioning efforts. We announced that we were going to sell or spin Network Power and sell the Leroy-Somer and CT business. Today, we're very excited to announce that we found two strong partners to buy these respective businesses. Platinum buying the Network Power business and a great solution for this business; and one that we are excited about for Platinum, the management team and long-term even potentially us, given that we will have some potential upside if they're successful and with our 15% equity ownership down the road. Also, Nidec, a strong Japanese company that we've known for a long time, I've known the Chairman for years, buying our Leroy-Somer CT business and managing that business going forward. Again, a great solution for these two businesses with a good outcome for Emerson, with over $5 billion of investment value for Emerson and our shareholders and for allowing us to reposition the company. We will have one more transaction in 2017. If you remember, we talked about selling ClosetMaid and we said we'd do that in 2017. In total, we'd do somewhere between $5 billion to $6 billion in proceeds. And so, we're well within what we expected back in February. So we look forward to closing these two transactions before the end of the calendar year and moving forward as the new Emerson and trying to drive a stronger valuable proposition for our customers and for our shareholders. Now the third quarter. Yes, it was a tough quarter, a very tough quarter. June was a very challenging industrial marketplace for us, especially on process. Given the recent announcements of the GDP numbers, it shouldn't surprise any of us. The numbers announced last week from business investment for the last nine months were negative and declining. Restatements for the last couple of years made it worse. So we're facing a very tough environment and we saw that very quickly in the month of June as our Process Transactional business really slowed down, as our customers continued to protect cash flow and their investments to make sure they have the cash needed to run the businesses or pay dividends or whatever they're doing, but clearly a very challenging environment, but an environment where our team across Emerson knows what to do. And we're acting on it very aggressively and making sure we keep our costs in line, making sure we do the right things internally to protect the key investments, but also keep our costs in line to allow us to generate the profits, the cash and the returns we expect at this company. In total, profitability with the third quarter was pretty good. We generated operating margins flat with last year at 17.4%, in case you didn't figure that out, 17.4% with down underlying sales of over 4%. Cash flow was very strong in the quarter. We were strong in cash flow for the first nine months. We will continue to generate the cash flow to run the company, to invest and pay money back to our shareholders and do what we need to do. But we have to face the reality of what we see today. It's a tough market. We did see a bounce back in July in our process orders, which is a good sign. But in reality, we are look at a marketplace right now where people are being very cautious, they are being very careful with what they're spending money on and they are very uncertain relative to what's going on around the world from a political standpoint relative to just a business environment standpoint and where things are heading. So we're staying very focused on trying to drive the necessary actions to protect the short-term profitability, at the same time, staying very focused on making the right, relevant, long-term investments to drive the necessary change that we'll see in this business, this industry when we come out. We will come out. This industry will come out. But clearly, a challenging marketplace right now and one that we fully understand that we have to deal with and we will deal with it. Now let's think \u2013 on the positive side of this. We had many people out there doubting that Emerson could take the transaction, the repositioning and get the job done. But the team within corporate, the team within Network Power, the team within LSCT and our external partners did a lot of work the last 12 months and came up with very strong proposition both for our shareholders and for the buyers of these actions and of the remaining assets that are being bought. Very pleased with the work there, not easy to do in a marketplace, by the way, which is quite challenging. So my hats off to the entire team around the world for making this happen. Also want to thank the team for landing a tough quarter, a quarter that was a lot tougher than we started out thinking about it and in reality, it ended up being very challenging, but we got the job done and delivered pretty good levels of profitability and levels of cash flow. No, it was not what we expected, but still, very good in the environment we're seeing. From the perspective of the board and the senior management team, we're very focused on the future of the company. We have been repositioning the company and we continue to reposition the company. It is a very solid company when we get down to the two businesses that will remain at the end of the calendar year. And we're very much focused on making the necessary investments internally and through strategic acquisitions to build upon these two businesses to once, again, return to over $20 billion in sales, profitable sales and profitable returns. The opportunities are there and we're working on those. Yes, it's a tough environment, but that's no problem within Emerson, we deal with those tough environments. That's what we do. It's our DNA. Clearly, would I like to have better times? Yes. But that's not what we face today. So we're facing reality. We're very much focused on driving a stronger company, a more profitable company, a faster growing company and remain an industry leader in the two key business units, business segments that we'll have when we finish. A tough quarter. Fourth quarter is going to be tough too. Wasn't long ago I thought that maybe we'd actually have flat or up sales in the fourth quarter. That's not going to happen. So we're having to deal with that. And from our perspective, as we continue to restructure and get ready for a challenging 2017, it will be more favorable coming through a very difficult last 18 months, but still a challenging environment for us. But we are well positioned and will continue to be well positioned to derive levels of profitability that will generate great cash flow and returns and over time will continue to return to the growth mode that we know with inside Emerson. So yes, I look back at the third quarter, a tough one, but we got a lot done. Within 12 months from the announcement of the concept of repositioning and selling or Network Power business, LSCT, we did it. We got it announced. We are looking at how reorganized on the company to drive longer-term value, very good. The game is still on. The hard work is still happening and I want to thank the entire management team globally, working so hard here the last 12 months and in this quarter to deliver what we need to deliver to continue to move Emerson forward, to remain relevant and an industry leader in the space as we serve today and will continue to serve going forward in 2017 and beyond. With that, I'll open the floor for questions or comments. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good afternoon, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): So look, I know it's early you don't want to give specific 2017 guidance, but can you talk about the puts and takes in terms of 2017 EPS? You've got dilution from the sales of your businesses. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No, thank you. I will not talk about 2017. I will not talk about 2017. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Wait, Andy. Let's be realistic here. We're in the process of selling two businesses that will happen in our first quarter of 2017. We're in the process of going through, what I call, continuing restructuring process. We're in process of going through an environment where people are still cutting back spending. So I'm going to give you a forecast. I've had a tough time this year. So I had a better view six months ago than I do now. So from my perspective, I'm not going to give you a forecast for 2017. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's fair. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: For people trying to guess 2017 right now, I think it's a pure guess. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): I understand. So just shifting gears then, you're guiding to $90 million to $100 million of restructuring expense this year. You've done, I think, $43 million so far. So we know you've mentioned in the past that restructuring takes time. But when we look at restructuring going forward, you're seeing Process Management business have lower decrementals in the quarter than last quarter. How do we look at margins going forward in Process Management? Could the decrementals get a little worse before they get better? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: From our perspective, yes. I think what we're going to see is from a Process Management standpoint, we'll have a good fourth quarter process because it's always our best quarter. And we have a lot of restructuring underway in Process, a lot of things have been announced and we'll be starting to book or starting to book already. So we expect that we'll be close to the $90 million level restructuring at fourth quarter. Clearly, you have timings when things get pushed and shoved, but we're going to continue to restructure there in the fourth quarter, then also in the first half for Process Automation. It looks to me right now that Process Automation, from a profitability standpoint, are going to be going down into the operating level, probably around the high 17%, low 18%; EBIT margin is obviously lower because of the restructuring. And they'll bounce back into that 20% level, but will not bounce back in 2017 based on what we see right now. I do not see the growth coming in the Process world to drive that leverage back up. So we're in the mode right now of trying to protected and minimize the downfall in profitability. And so what we're looking at right now probably from profitability is somewhere between 200 basis points, 250 basis points, I would say deterioration in profitability at the operating level line of the Process business for 2016. And we'll stabilize that as we get into that \u2013 into 2017. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful, Dave. And then if you looked at \u2013 remember you gave the order growth curve to us in May and you talked about it potentially going positive in July. And I know you talked about it sort of being delayed. How do you think about that order growth curve? Now, I know you said it's very hard to forecast, but is it fair to say it just sort of pushed out maybe six months to nine months? Any commentary on orders as we go forward here? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: The order curves that we see today have trended pretty much in line where I thought they'd trend, except for Process. On the Process segment, we've been bouncing between this minus 12% to minus 14% underlying order rate now for over a year. And until, you know, we anticipated, including myself \u2013 I made the call, no one else did, I made this call \u2013 that I thought that would start lifting up towards the minus single-digit. It has not happened. So based on what I see right now, the rest of the businesses have continued to trend upward and would be pulling us up to positive, they would have pulled us up earlier to positive, but until Process Management starts seeing, I would say, a lift in the order pace, which right now is running as minus 12%, minus 13% range, until we start seeing that move off that range, and we'll communicate that. So once it goes into this minus 5% to minus 10%, then you're going to start seeing the total Emerson lift come. But right now, Process is such a big piece; it's down at a level that we have not seen a lift to pull us up. So that's what we see right now. And I see no indication that we'll see that going into single-digit underlying order pattern in the rest of this fiscal year, which is the fourth quarter. So most likely, we'll start seeing it as we move out of this quarter going into the first quarter and the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Thanks. Good questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. Thanks, and good afternoon. Dave, you... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Steve. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: You invited questions or comments, so I am \u2013 I actually am going to take the leap here and say congratulations on getting a sale done, which I know we've been debating for a long time. So congrats on that. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you. A lot of hard work by a lot of people out there, Steve, that you should be thanking, not me. I mean, I'm just \u2013 there are other people that did a lot of work on that one; it's not easy, and do it right for the organization, which is very important. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Right. And you had to still agree to and get it done. The midpoint for the fourth quarter implied, I think, sequentially is about a 5%, just over a 5% sequential step-up. It is a little bit more than we've seen historically. And given all the order rates you keep giving us, it certainly makes me \u2013 just want to understand a little bit, is there \u2013 are there any bright spots in here that are making us think that this would be just a little bit better than usual from 3Q to 4Q? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Based on the \u2013 if you look at our underlying order pattern, we've been, on total Emerson, we've been running underlying around the 4% \u2013 the 4.5%, 5%, if you look at the pure underlying order rate. So right now, what we're seeing is that \u2013 if that pattern continues what we've been seeing, then we should be able to reach this from the standpoint sequentially from the sales. We are also seeing, on a positive standpoint, we are seeing \u2013 we had a lot \u2013 we had some inventory liquidation in some of our channel in the month of June and \u2013 May and June in some of the Commercial and Residential. We expect that that \u2013 some of that will return in the fourth quarter. We also expect some of our compressor-type of business, which is the heat and the refrigeration markets, we expect a little bit of lift in that, which will help us as we go into the fourth quarter. We're not expecting much from the Process Automation. If you look at the underlying business, we were down last year in the fourth quarter around 10% in sales for Process. We'll be expect to be down again around 10% again for the fourth quarter. So we're seeing the other businesses are seeing a little lift and that's what's going to pull us up and we are banking the fact that Process does not have a leg down. So I was very pleased to see Process came in in preparation for today's board meeting and showed us the July orders \u2013 the way they work, they do a 4%, 4.5%, so we know the July orders, and they bounced up back to a run rate that got back into the average that they've been seeing for the last five months or six months and way above what we saw in June. So we did see a bounce back there. So that's how we look at it right now, Steve. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then if you look at just MRO versus CapEx type of demand within Process and Industrial or just overall automation, any, at least a little more commentary on the MRO side? A little more \u2013 is there any more stabilization there? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Not really. We've seen very weak \u2013 and North America has been the real challenge for us. It would be Canada, U.S. and Mexico. The MRO business and the \u2013 what we call the transactional business had a very, very weak June, as people really \u2013 some of our customers curtailed spending, they're doing the turnarounds of the facilities and changes, for the facilities and maintenance, but they're doing it very, very carefully and really cutting back on the extent of how much money is being spent. So that has not seen an improvement. We expected that to stabilize, but it's not yet. That will be a key sign for us. And I think that is also a reflection that you see in the GDP. When you deconstruct the GDP in the United States the last three quarters, you'll see that business investment continues to deteriorate. And that's one of the areas we're seeing right now is that day-to-day MRO type of business and that's hurt us in this space. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And can I just sneak one more in? Given your prior commentary about where to deploy the capital going forward, and especially now that you're through this big milestone, are you thinking still \u2013 you talked about a couple, one or two transformational deals versus bolts-on. What should investors \u2013 are you leaning \u2013 do you think we should expect one bolt-on versus transformational? Or it's really up in the air? Or what? What are you thinking? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We continue to do little bolt-ons. We've done a couple of smaller transactions, the unique software transactions in the Commercial Residential business the last 30 days, 40 days. We are continuing to look for a strategic investment in either the Automation business or the Commercial Residential business. So in discussions with the Board today, we're very much focused on driving our trend \u2013 what we call a more strategic type of deal, a bigger deal. And clearly with the balance sheet strength, we can do that. But we're still very much focused on that and our focus is to get that done sometime in the next three, four, five, six months. We're not going to do anything stupid, but we're looking at where we can invest and make a stronger, core Industrial Automation business or core Automation Solutions business in this tough marketplace. So we're going to work it hard. We're not going to step back and wait. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks, Dave. I'll hand it off. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks a lot. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Afternoon. Just following up on the issue of the stepped-up restructuring, so if we think about the sort of RemainCo Automation Solution segment, is the idea that the restructuring you've announced today, that should be sufficient to keep margins sort of flat in that business over the next 12 months, even if sales declined sort of a single-digit rate? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. Our goal is within the Automation business \u2013 Commercial Residential Solutions business restructuring is really starting to tail off. Bob Sharp and Jim Lindemann have really done a very good job. They got ahead of this and that business is doing better. So our goal here is between this year and the first six months of Automation Solutions business is again spend restructuring. We're going to probably spend somewhere between $50 million and $60 million next year. And the goal is to maintain the profitability level of this business, plus or minus a tenth or two. So that is the goal. We're trying to find where we can find that bottom without, Julian, without as I tell my board, I will not jeopardize the future of that franchise because it is a franchise. But we clearly are working that equation right now relative \u2013 as the business has continued to weaken as we look at probably next year, as I've said, probably low single-digit negative growth in the Automation Solutions business. How do we protect that profitability at the level we finish this year? And that's what the game is. And that's what we're trying to structure. That's how we're working the equation right now. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Understood. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And then just a follow-up around the sort of gross margin's impact from price versus from material cost. I guess for you, for everyone, that's been a tailwind for 12 months, 18 months in particular. When you look in the next 12 months where input costs are now, and what pricing is doing particularly for large projects, how do you see the price-cost delta shifting, if at all? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: From our perspective, it has been a positive for us. If you look at our GP margins, we had a \u2013 our GP margin this quarter was what, Frank, we were up this year \u2013 this quarter. I think our GP margin was up this quarter. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: We were up. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think we have one more good quarter of it, Julian, to be honest. And then my feeling is what you've heard me talk about. I think that shift is going come and the wind is going to come against us a little bit. And I fundamentally believe that we're going to start seeing that squeeze and we will not have the positive, and that we'll have to fight pretty hard to maintain a neutral balance. But I wouldn't be surprised if we don't have a quarter or two where the wind goes against us. But right now, we're in a mode where we're still positive, but I think there's a period coming maybe early 2017, where it goes against me for a couple quarters. But we're working that hard \u2013 yeah. Frank Dellaquila said we're up 0.2% on the GP margin for the quarter. So that \u2013 your assessment is right. Give us another quarter and then we'll probably get two quarters or three quarters coming out that will be more challenging. It will probably be neutral or slightly negative. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. But pricing itself, you and your competitors, is that changing much? Or not really versus six months ago? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. Pricing is not changing. What's happening right now, the pricing \u2013 I think we talked about pricing around the negative \u2013 on average negative 0.5, negative 0.6, negative 0.7 for the year. We're well within that boundary right now. And the net material inflation has been good for us and it's been good for all the people. So the pricing is staying well within that boundary. I think next year, we'll probably \u2013 I mean if I took a snapshot right now, Julian, and think about next year, I think it'll be slightly negative; won't be quite as negative as this year, but our net material inflation won't be as positive. And we could have that switch coming on, where you \u2013 often you get squeezed a little bit. So that's what I see right now. But people are behaving \u2013 we've got other issues out there from a manufacturing standpoint, like too much capacity and stuff like that. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Agreed. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company LLC : Yes. Thanks, David. I may have missed it, but could you elaborate on what the tax leakage is from the two divestitures, if any? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, the tax \u2013 I'll let Frank talk about the tax leakage a little bit. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, so we've got gross proceeds, as we told you earlier today, of about $5.2 billion. The net proceeds will probably come in around $4.3 billion, $4.4 billion. So we've got a bit of tax leakage on both of them, a lot of moving parts, especially around the Network Power deal. In terms of where we're recognizing gains and losses, where we have basis, but that's about the net of it right there. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company LLC : Thank you. And just one other one. We've heard a lot about the M&A pipeline on the AS business. Can you talk about what you're looking for in the C&RS business? What types of technologies or geographies that you're looking at? And any sense of what the size of some of those opportunities might in fact be? Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. Most of the opportunities within the Commercial Residential Solutions, I will use the real names, not the abbreviation. I've got Kathy in, my head of marketing, and she's beating me over the top of the head with my \u2013 I got hit with my own baseball bat. From our perspective, what we're looking for is sensing; we're looking for sensing type of technologies to allow us to create a bigger solution within our core product that we have there today. We're looking for software, we're looking for monitoring, we're looking for the transformation that we did in the process world back 20 years ago when we created a very strong Component business and created sensing, solutions, the software. And that's where we are taking the position for the Commercial Residential. The business acquisitions, most of them right now will be probably in the $20 million to $100 million range. There might be another one $200 million. No big significant acquisitions in what I would say the next 12 to 18 to 24 months. Bob Sharp and his team is driving the solutions strategy around this right now. It's sort of the early days of understanding how to create that. One of the things Bob is coming from the process world and understanding that, so I'm expecting him to create a more of a solution type of environment around this and to leverage the core assets, the leading assets we have in that space. So \u2013 but it's going to be smaller, sensing, solution, software type acquisitions, and companies you've probably never even heard of or thought of, to be honest. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company LLC : Thanks a lot, guys. Good luck. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. Dave, I echo the congratulations on getting the sales done and for the amount that you got them done. I guess as I think about your capital allocation priorities, clearly we've been talking about the M&A. But can you maybe touch on the dividend once again? I know it's kind of like a Holy Grail for you, but I'm trying to get a sense for whether you're planning to set aside any of the capital from the net proceeds to fund the dividend going forward and how to think about buyback in that context as well. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. Thanks. First of all, thank you very much for recognizing the sale. I appreciate that. As I've been communicating for over a year on sort of our utilization of cash flow going toward, yes, the dividend is important to us. It's important not to us per se, but to our shareholders. And from our perspective, where we are right now, with the shrinking of the company down to, say, around $15 billion and the cash flow coming down along those lines, we will be detecting (48:55) our dividend as we've discussed at the board level for the next couple years. The goal is obviously to grow the company both organically and through acquisitions, to rebuild the cash flow base that we're losing from the divestitures. But right now, as you think about our company and you think about our free cash, let's think about our free cash flow next year. And let's say we take the dividend up marginally a little bit like we did this year. Our dividend coverage \u2013 our cash flow, the free cash flow of the dividend coverage is going to go around the mid-60% level. And so, our goal is to figure out how to keep that \u2013 peak at that mid-60%s, maybe higher 60%s and then move it back down in the range of 40% to 50%. As I've told the shareholders, however, let's say that we're not able to find significant strategic acquisitions, we're not able to get the growth necessary to get back up to the size of the earnings and cash flow base that we had just a couple of years ago. Then we will, as a board, will have to consider do we cut the dividend. But that is not where we sit right now. Right now, we have the capability of both funding internally and doing the dividend and will dial back the share repurchase. And this year, we're going to end up around $600 million of share repurchase, next year will probably be somewhere in the $100 million to $200 million range, just basically covering any stock we're putting out there for employees \u2013 and but we'll dial that back. The intention of the board, as we discussed a lot over the last 12 months, the use of proceeds and our balance sheet to go out and continue to do aggressively \u2013 make investments within the two core spaces we're maintaining, we're keeping the company, and that's where our focus is going to be. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it, that's really helpful. And I guess maybe one last question and I know it's probably too early to talk about 2017. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No way. Go ahead. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I'm going to ask it anyway. I guess if you're thinking about just the underlying trends that you're seeing in process today, if those underlying trends were to hold steady through the year and as we progress into 2017, can you guys grow margins given the price cost commentary earlier as well as the restructuring actions that you're taking in that business? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think to be very honest with you, I think given the current trends, the underlying growth rate of our Automation business next year will be slightly negative, will be low single-digit negative sales. From that perspective, with the restructuring we're doing, we're going to do (51:29) everything possible to protect our profitability as we finish this year in that environment, and so that's what I see right now until I see our customer base willing to invest more for productivity, invest for next-generation capacity or whatever it takes, that it's going to be a tough environment. So I don't see that. On the Commercial Residential, we do see underlying growth and we do see a little bit of improvement in profitability. Next year, the focus of that business will be the integration of some of the \u2013 on the various businesses, as we've talked about streamlining, creating a very strong global integrated business, and so that's where that focus are going to be. So next year, I would say that business will be \u2013 will have a positive underlying growth and most likely we'll see a little bit continued margin improvement, which \u2013 and the business is running at pretty good levels of profitability right now. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you very much. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Johnny. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, Dave. So maybe a question for Frank or perhaps you. In February, you gave us a pro forma EPS number of $2.60. And now that we've done these transactions, the guidance has come down. And I guess just with all the corporate moving parts and stuff, what is that \u2013 what maps (52:49) to that $2.60 for fiscal 2016 pro forma? What would be the number today? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's going to be lower; I can tell you that. It's a little bit early to say how we finish up, but it's definitely going to be lower than that and it's going to be moving \u2013 it's obviously more closer to the $2.50 range and slightly lower. But it's going to be \u2013 that's what we're \u2013 clearly, with our EPS now down lower, I think that's what's \u2013 just being (53:13) reality, that's what's going to happen right now. But the basis is going to be more in that line at this point in time. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And then pro forma, how much of your free cash, so pro forma, so these businesses have gotten \u2013 how much of the free cash or how much free cash would you be generating in the United States? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Still going to be about 50/50. The profile of the company from sales profitability, it does not change much from the \u2013 John, as we operate going into the transformation and as we go to the next \u2013 the NewCo, doesn't change much. So it's going to be about the same. And so we're losing cash flow operating cash flow, Frank, around... Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: $400 million to $500 million. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: $400 million to $500 million. So \u2013 but as you look at the generation of $3 billion, we lose $400 million to $500 million, it's going to be the same makeup between U.S. and international. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I was just trying to bridge the dividend is like $1.2 billion and change, right? You raised a little bit. You've got half of your free cash. Is it \u2013 just the question is almost to Joe's question, is are we generating enough U.S. free cash to pay this? And it seems like we're kind of on top of that, right? It's... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We're on top of that. And the other issue we've talked about is that one thing Frank and his team is looking at right now is we will be making \u2013 assuming we don't do anything from an acquisition standpoint, we will be bringing back cash flow at a very low tax cost to us, as we talked about both in February and this year. So Frank, you might want to mention... Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. As we walk through these transactions and as we move toward closing, we're looking at bringing back all the proceeds because we'll receive a significant amount of proceeds offshore. But we'll bring everything back as well as all the cash that was in those businesses that had been generating over time. So we'll have pretty significant cushion here in the U.S. as we do that. And then we normally bring back $400 million to $500 million of cash very efficiency every year anyway. So we understand the issue on the dividend and the share repurchase, but we think we have it covered. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. One thing we do with our finance committee is we very clearly lay out the cash flow needs over a couple of years and where that money is coming from. So we try not to get ourselves surprised and boxed, but it's easier for us to see it than you. So that's how we understand the issue. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No. That's fine. I think the Network Power transaction, talked about Emerson retaining a subordinated position. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: What exactly does that mean? Does that mean you're some sort of a minority interest accounting number? Or is that actually pertaining to... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. There will not be any of that. There will be no minority interest. We have no board fees. What we have is if the business does well and we'll be retaining a 15% subordinated equity piece, if the business goes well and something happens and they make their return, then we \u2013 then obviously we'll get a piece of that on the upside. So that gives us a little bit of capability if something does go well and a lot of the efforts we put in the last couple of years, we have a chance of making something down the road. Maybe my successor or whoever has a chance to have a little bit more money coming out of that for our own shareholders at some point in time. But no minority interest on the balance sheet in this one. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: No, it's not, from an accounting sense, an equity position. It's a subordinated interest, which under the right circumstances, could be a very good payout for us down the road. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That makes sense. Lastly, is there a timeline, Dave, where you would say now we've sort of accomplished the M&A for this? I mean, in other words, you've sort of given yourself a two-year window on the dividend. Does that imply that the execution of replacing the lost earnings is over two years? Or \u2013 I mean, obviously you would want it to be front-end loaded, right? Except that the M&A markets, it's a little bit pricey. So I'm just curious how you would like us to think about the timeline, perhaps, of deployment of proceeds to do these acquisitions? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, from our perspective, Frank and I, we review with the Board and also the Finance Committee. We see that \u2013 where the two years come from, the fact that we know we have to be in a map, or sort of like a roadmap of figuring out how to get that \u2013 our return coverage interest \u2013 coverage from the dividend on free cash flow coming back down towards the 50% level. And so that's why we say two years because if we don't have a roadmap that's through acquisitions or faster internal growth, then the pressure is going to be building both us as a management team, the board and our shareholders and say hey, how long can you maintain that high level of dividend payout without damaging the company? So that's why we look at that and say a two-year window, a nice round number to talk about. That's why I say that. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Got it. Perfect. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good afternoon, everyone. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Rob. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. I guess, Dave, in terms of your comments around Process, I mean, obviously you talked about perhaps a bounce in July orders. But obviously, we're now in a bear market for oil again, given recent trading. So I guess what gives you confidence that we're not going to see something kind of worst going forward? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I don't have confidence. I mean, from our perspective, just go read the transcripts from any of the oil and gas companies reported, all we do is we look at our businesses, we look at what's going on in transaction, look at the day-to-day order book and what comes in. We have good systems, we can see that. The fact that I look at the stability and the flattening of certain things and we make a call. So that's the type of confidence level I have. And I know of no customer out there saying, oh, things are great, we're looking at increasing spending. But we have a very broad and diverse business, global business, a lot of industries. And so that's how we make that call. And I was just \u2013 I am encouraged by the fact that we did see a bounce back in July because June was a very \u2013 I mean a knock-you-over-the-head type of month for our Process business, so that's where I'm coming from. And we'll see. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: In terms of the Network Power acquisition, the six \u2013 I mean how would you, on the basis of your guidance, the performance of the businesses right now, how would you categorize the EV to EBITDA multiple paid on 2016 numbers? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're talking about (59:22)? The number we showed was... Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: I think if you look at our trailing 12 months, we're right in the 8 range on EBITDA, plus we've got the upside. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then the final question is \u2013 I mean from a capital allocation standpoint, you're kind of between a rock and a hard place here. And from that standpoint, you've got companies that are probably having a road in fundamentals right now and you have to take a look at them in a public equity market that, in the main, is still rising, still high valuations. I mean, is there a case to be made to kind of batten the hatches here? Shift capital allocation and then just get a better sense of where we are on the down cycle before pursuing something more aggressive on the strategic front? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean, we obviously look at everything, but we'll make that call based on what assets are potentially out there for us to make a call on. I mean I think that if you have unique opportunities, you have to take those opportunities. If you think about our business, the Automation business we're involved with, there are few and far-between assets you can actually interact with, so you do what you have to deal with. But \u2013 let's just put this way, I'm not looking to go out and do something really quick and crazy with the $4 billion which I don't have yet. But I think from our perspective, we see the opportunity and we see a situation \u2013 we're going to take advantage of the situation. Right now, it's a tough marketplace out there. And you try to find \u2013 you ever try to get to bottoms when to buy stocks or buy things? You're going to lose. That's a loser's strategy. We're going to buy assets we think we can make money. And so I look at people that sold the day of Brexit and the day after Brexit. I would call that very short-term thinking. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Congrats on getting the deal done. Talk to you later. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon. Hi, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Congratulations on getting everything coordinated for (1:01:21) today. That's quite a task. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So I know you've clarified that you're not going to give any 2016/2017 guidance. But you \u2013 back in February (1:01:34), you talked about $0.65 of lost earnings from the assets to be sold in (1:01:40). Obviously 2016, there's been a lot of moving parts on Network Power, probably a little better than plan (1:01:46), industrial automation, their worth. So are we still on track with our $0.65 impact? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, I \u2013 well, I just said in the \u2013 a couple of minutes ago, I think what we've said, the impact will be about the same, maybe a little bit more, maybe about the same. But because our \u2013 the base in 2016 will be lower on that number than we talked about. We talked I think $2.60 EPS. That number's now going to be lower because from the standpoint of the whole range came down. But I think if you look at the Network Power and Leroy-Somer assets, there's about the same number. Delta's about the same. Just one's done better, one's done worse, so that's about where we see it right now. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So the net impact's about the same. Okay, that's helpful. And then perhaps a question for Frank. The tax rates for the pro forma Emerson, how does that look? Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: About the same as the old Emerson. It really comes out pretty much the same way as the total company is today, so there's not \u2013 I don't expect any material change in the tax rate. I think we're going to be in that 30% to 31% range going forward. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just finally over to the last pieces, (1:02:48) you said probably mid-2017 for this. I'm assuming that proceeds from that would take us right in the middle of that range, the $4.4 billion to $4.7 billion? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Exactly. Exactly. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think that \u2013 yeah, it's not a huge transaction and we'll \u2013 our people have been pretty busy right now on this one, so we'll get \u2013 we'll launch that sometime early 2017. The exact \u2013 we'll be \u2013 I think we talked about $5 billion to $6 billion, and then we'll be right in that range with this one too. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, guys. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: And then we're done. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Dave, I was hoping you could expand a bit more on the potential divestitures. And as I was going through Kathy's slides, you still have a legacy exposure to data centers with Liebert. And I just wanted to hear from you what sort of linkages you think that business has? It certainly does with climate, but beyond the climate linkage, where else does Liebert fit within the business on the go-forward? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Liebert is part of the Network Power business which is being divested. So... Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: There is no \u2013 there is no \u2013 if you look at our Network Power business, which if you think about the business in that you have Liebert, you have Chloride, you have ASCO Power, you have Avocent, you have Avansys, businesses that we've had for a long time or maybe acquisitions. That's the compromise \u2013 that's the composition of the business that are being divested. So those businesses will make up the Network Power business which is being invested and bought by Platinum today and run by Scott Barbour and then the Leroy-Somer CT business, which was the \u2013 what we call the Industrial Automation businesses that were left out with those businesses we've had for a long time will also \u2013 those are being sold to Nidec in a separate transaction. So once we're down with that, the only business left that doesn't fit within our Automation Solutions business is our ClosetMaid business, which is a storage business we bought many, many years ago and did very well with; and there's no reason to keep that, so we're moving that out. And then at that point in time, all the business will fit in very nicely and have a lot of core strength between Commercial & Residential Solutions and Automation. And maybe, Craig, come back \u2013 come and come in and see (01:05:07) sometime and go through it, so you can see the two business segments and how everything fit together. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : No. That's helpful. Just looks as though that slide hasn't been updated because you still have data set of thermal management included on the umbrella of the businesses. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. Okay. Because that's within \u2013 okay. Okay. Now I \u2013 okay now I understand the (01:05:26) question, Deane. So you're right. Within the Helix, our interim center, we actually have a cooling data center there which we're monitoring and with that, from that standpoint, that was built in when obviously Network Power's a part of us and we'll work with them down the road to help them but as part of cooling, but it's just more of a compression thing. That's all it will be in the (01:05:46). That will not be our core part. They do have that capability within the Helix today because our customers want to look at cooling, precision cooling or humidity or whatever it is. And that's nothing to do with business we're keeping. It's just within that engineering center there in Dayton, Ohio. Good grace. Thank you. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks for that clarification. Just a last question, I don't mean to spin you up, but you did bring up the thought that there could be some of the business investment hesitancy because of political uncertainty, and how meaningful do you think that is across your businesses today? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean I don't think \u2013 I mean, from my perspective, North America, I'm sure there's some hesitation relative to spending, but really \u2013 and you think about \u2013 it really boils down to the overall economies not growing. 1% growth for the last two quarters or three quarters or four quarters is not very exciting; and I think that that's created an environment where businesses are being very, very cautious at spending money. Political environments around the world is more of a function of what's going on in Europe, our elections here, what's going on in Japan. It's just there's a lot of uncertainty relative to, well, from a government standpoint just what \u2013 where the direction is of the government. Are we going to try to create negative interest rates for the world? Are we going to try to invest and grow the world? And right now I see more of an environment where we want to create negative interest rates and give people free money; and there's no incentive to invest. So I thought that's the only environment, I'd say. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Good afternoon, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. And just in terms of this June and July stuff with the process, I mean there are parts of the oil and gas world seem to be stabilizing during that period of time, but other parts seem to be still getting worse. I mean as you talk to some of the customers and took some of that feedback in June, I mean were you able to make any sense of parts that were stabilizing versus parts taking another leg down? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: From what we're seeing, what we saw was clearly they're doing the maintenance, they're doing the turnaround situations, but they clearly are being told to spend less on it; and that's what we're seeing right now. And from the standpoint of June, June's normally a very big month for our process industry because of all the turnaround situations over the summer months; and I think that our customer base just got a little bit more cautious in that month and hopefully there's \u2013 maybe they're getting through that period right now and they're going to feel \u2013 and go back to a little bit more the normal pace we've been seeing. But June was such a shocker to us relative to how much they decided to contract. But I just think people are being super, super cautious, and bosses are probably saying, hey, we did it for $1 last couple of years; can you do this now for $0.50? And so, I think that's was going on in this environment right now. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then just as you think about investing in the process business both organically and via M&A, I mean, Emerson was a real trend-setter in terms of digital communication and asset management of devices, et cetera, and now there's a lot of activity going on in that space. I mean, do you think there's anything you need to do differently there? Or do you \u2013 still comfortable with the control platform and just think you want to add more devices to it? Maybe just give a sense of where you think you are there? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: From the control platform or from diagnostics, sensing and stuff like that, we continue to invest, we continue to buy technologies, we continue to do internal investments on those technologies. Nothing real big in that space as we continue to make sure that we stay, keep a leading position as we go forward here. So a lot of our investment dollars are still safe in that space right there. We will continue to look at acquisitions relative to offering a broader package relative to our solutions. So bringing more capability to the end market relative to the capabilities both from control, from its rotation, from valves, whatever it takes, measurement out there. So we'll continue to look at trying to add to that capability. But we continue to be a leading investor, relative to your first question, relative to sensing, control and diagnostics; and we'll continue to do that going forward, because we have no intention of losing that. So that's the fine line we walk relative to where we slow down our investments and where we don't slow down our investments. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. A question on process, Dave, as you've seen a deeper trough manifest here, how does that inform your view of expectation for a steeper recovery at some point versus kind of just the more absolute baseline reset? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: My opinion is the deeper we go, the longer we stay down here, the faster the snap back. I've been here once before. I saw it. And so, the more pain you have, the better in the end. No fun having the pain upfront, but the better a snap back. So right now it's a deeper pain going down; it's a longer pain going down. And that tells me one thing, that spending will have to bounce back at a faster rate. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's it. Thanks. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: And knowledgeable about (1:11:16) this industry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Steve. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I think there was some cash over in like China or something with Network Power. What's happening with that? Does that go to the buyer? Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: I think we've worked out contractually a way to get that out of there over time, over and above some reasonable amount that needs to be left behind. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: It's not a worry. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Is that kind of part of the \u2013 and this is \u2013 just basically this is an earn-out, right? I mean is what you're kind of \u2013 you propose to these guys? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No, no, no. Steve, Steve, when they buy the business, they will write a check for $4 billion. And then if \u2013 they are going to run the business and if the business does well \u2013 and we've made a lot of investments with that business and you can see it's been progressing to come back \u2013 and the business does well and down the road if things do really well and they have a chance to sell the business, or take it public or whatever they do with it, and there's an upside from what they return, then we have a chance to get a little bit more money down the road too ourselves. So upfront, the day they take this company, they're going to pay us $4 billion cash right up front. So we get money. And typically we'll work the cash balances around the world. As you said, there are taxes around the world, and we will leave what we consider adequate cash for our business, but the rest of that cash belongs to Emerson and our shareholders. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then just one last question just on I guess kind of the cultural direction here. I mean, you guys walked through the website on the conference call, which we've kind of never really seen that before. So obviously you're trying to put a foot forward when it comes down to the transformation of the company. GE has got these commercials out there, even though it's like literally 2% of sales for them. I'm just wondering like how \u2013 is there like something going on in the industrial world where there is \u2013 is this kind of an internally driven thing or is there some consultants running around trying to pitch this story? It just seems like everybody is talking about IoT at the same time. And to varying degrees, what is your percentage of sales? Because I think you guys have a decent amount in software, better than the other guys, but I haven't seen it before. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. We have a lot there. We're not buzzing IoT. I mean, in reality, there is no consultant running around. I've got Kathy, and she's got a little minion here and she is right here next to her. So it's a dynamic duo team right here. Steve, there's no consultants. I think that why we did this today, it's very important, this webcast is listened to by a lot of our employees, too. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: And one of the key issues from our perspective right now, we're communicating to you, we're communicating to our customers and internally. And what's going on right now, our customers are looking for what are we going to look like, how this thing look like going forward when we come out in October. So I asked Kathy to come in and to talk about it. There are no buzzwords here. I mean we're very much into Internet of Things and we have been involved in this for a long time, going back to initial Internet of Things been called PlantWeb, which I used to present when I was running the process business. So I think that it's just people like to talk about it and we felt very important for you to understand, and for our investors to understand and then also for our employees understand where we're trying to take this in the next two months to three months as we unfold this transaction. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Hello, Jeff. Good afternoon. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : How's it going? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : I just wanted to make sure I totally got the cash proceeds right. So the $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion net is after-tax payments that you make and includes cash that you're repatriating as part of the transaction...? Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: No. That includes the cash tax payments, Jeff, on the taxable gains. There's another couple of hundred million. Depending on what we decide to do on repatriation that we would incur, we can bring a lot of cash home at a very low effective incremental rate. But it would be another couple hundred million of cash taxes if we bring home all the proceeds, as well as all the cash that was in the businesses. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: So it's real simple, $5.2 billion of proceeds, we pay taxes for the transactions, some with losses, some gains around the world. We'll end up somewhere around $4.3 billion of cash sitting in our bank account that we'll use to do something with. That simple. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Is there any election, a 338(h) or anything like that that has some negative ramifications for you guys down the road? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: No. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And then just one last one, Dave. Your comment about the dividend and deploying the capital and kind of bringing the cash flow back made sense. I wonder if you'd also, though, consider massive share repurchase to lower the share count and therefore lower the cash dividend amount, right? And it seems like you could kind of correct the imbalance that way if you wanted to. Is that something you would consider or not? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Not at this time. Our consideration is to invest in growing the business again and not liquidating the business. So the investment profile of the board is such that we feel that we have opportunities out there and we'll continue to have opportunities out there in the next couple of years. And we've gone through a whole process here saying (01:16:50) where do we want to focus. And so, our focus is in these two areas here and we're going to look to go out and buy assets and leverage those two businesses which are two very strong global profitable businesses; and that's what we're going to do. I'm not in the mode of buying stock back and taking the company private. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : No. I'm thinking more kind of further down the road, you suggested if you can't find deals dividend (01:17:12). All right. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I would just go all out (01:17:15) and take the company private. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : All right. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We move next to Jeremie Capron with CLSA. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon. Question on the underlying sales trend, do you have an idea of what it looks like excluding energy markets? I mean, I see the huge contraction in Middle East, Africa and Canada here. But Europe and U.S. don't look so bad. I suspect that if we exclude energy markets, you should be running positive this year? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean, we don't look at it that way, because there's a lot of cross-correlations in there. But I mean obviously the major oil and gas downturn in North America and Latin America and Middle East has definitely pulled it down. Obviously, I mean, we don't cut it that way. I don't have that capability of doing that, but clearly they're down quite a bit. So I would say that there's a good chance if you start cutting out and looking at a smaller part of Emerson, you could say it's growing. But that's not how we think about it. And I just don't see the numbers that way. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : Fair enough. And you commented on the valuation of the Network Power deal. Any comment on the Leroy-Somer? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. The price that we're talking about is $1.2 billion. I mean we'll end up \u2013 obviously there we have less taxes to pay in that transaction. And so, we'll end up probably around a little bit under $1 billion in cash when we're all said and done. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : And in terms of the earnings multiple on that? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's around 10 times. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: 10 times. 10.3 times. Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC : All right. Thanks very much. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I want to thank everybody. We wrapped up here. Again, I want to thank the organization around the world and particularly around the Network Power team, our Leroy-Somer-CT team, and the work working the Platinum folks from Network Power and Nidec on the Leroy-Somer CT. And I want to thank the organization. Yes, a very tough quarter. But we'll get our way through this and we'll get on into the next quarter and moving on to the next generation of Emerson. So thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate that. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation.",

Welcome to Emerson's Investor Conference Call. During today's presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. The conference is being recorded today, November 1, 2016. Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual effects to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Craig Rossman, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead, sir. Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you, William. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson, and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. In the fourth quarter results for the Network Power, Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques businesses were reported in discontinued operations. Considering this, and to aid in comparisons to prior quarters, we have provided results both on a continuing operations basis and on an adjusted basis, which includes these discontinued operations and excludes such items as separation cost for consistency. A further explanation of the reporting formats can be found on slide 2. Detailed bridges can also be found in the appendix to this presentation. Please turn to slide 3 for a summary of the fiscal year results. Fiscal year sales of $20.2 billion decreased 9% versus the prior year, with underlying sales down 6%. The fiscal year results reflected a more challenging economic environment than we expected as we entered the year, as the company has faced difficult conditions in its key served markets for seven consecutive quarters. Within our industrial businesses, the most significant factors have been the impact on energy-related customer spending from persistently low oil and gas prices as well as weak general industrial and emerging market spending. Across our other businesses, we did find bright spots related to generally more favorable market conditions in U.S. construction; data center spending, particularly cloud-based and co-location customers; telecommunications infrastructure; and global air-conditioning and refrigeration. Adjusted earnings per share decreased 6% to $2.98. As a result of the continuation of difficult market conditions, restructuring spending totaled $112 million for the fiscal year, exceeding our previous guidance of $90 million to $100 million. The completion of the actions also positions us for what we expect to be a challenging 2017. Finally, solid earnings, conversion and improved trade working capital performance resulted in strong operating cash flow generation of $2.9 billion, or $3.1 billion, which was 15.1% of sales, excluding $179 million of separation costs. Turning to slide 4, net sales of $5.5 billion were down 6%, with underlying sales down 5% in the quarter. Served market conditions in the fourth quarter remained generally consistent to previous quarters, with weak oil and gas and general industrial spending outweighing favorable data center, telecommunications, air conditioning and refrigeration spend. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.96 increased 3%. For the quarter, working capital improvement drove operating cash flow generation of $957 million. Turning to slide 5, favorable materials cost containment, restructuring benefits and solid operational execution led to gross profit of 41.7%, which was up 100 basis points, and EBIT margin of 16.8%, up 60 basis points versus the prior year. Turning to slide 6, the continuation of a low-growth environment led to underlying sales decreases in all geographies for the fiscal year. Fourth quarter underlying sales were generally representative of the full year but improved in some regions such as Asia, China and the United States. Turning to slide 7, total segment margin was up 140 basis points to 17.1%, primarily driven by benefits from restructuring actions and operational execution. Capital spending was held to $169 million, equal to the prior year. Turning to slide 8, Process Management sales decreased 11% as spending levels in energy-related markets remained low for both capital and operational expenditures, while power and life sciences customers continued to provide growth opportunities. Restructuring spending in the quarter was $54 million, slightly above the prior year. Segment margin decreased 280 basis points, primarily due to volume deleverage partially offset by savings from restructuring actions. The Automation businesses will remain under pressure through the majority of fiscal 2017, with the possibility of orders recovery in the second half assuming stability in oil and gas prices. Turning to slide 9, Industrial Automation sales decreased 7% resulting from a continuation of low levels of spending in upstream oil and gas and weak but slightly improving conditions in general industrial markets. Segment margin increased 190 basis points to 16.3%, primarily due to business mix, benefits from restructuring actions and lower restructuring spend in the quarter. The divestitures of the Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques businesses remain on track to close by the end of the calendar year. Looking ahead to 2017, general industrial markets will remain challenging, with slightly improving conditions as the year progresses. Turning to slide 10, Network Power underlying sales were flat in the quarter supported by favorable demand in power products, thermal management and service. Strong growth in North America was led by cloud-based and co-location data center customers as well as telecommunication spending by mobile and broadband providers. Segment margin improved 650 basis points to 13.1%, benefiting from favorable mix, savings from restructuring actions and gross profit improvement programs. The Network Power divestiture also remains on track for completion by the end of the calendar year. Turning to slide 11, Climate Technologies' sales increased 6%, driven by strong growth in U.S. residential and commercial air conditioning as well as refrigeration and residential air conditioning markets in China. Segment margin increased 320 basis points to 21.1%, primarily due to volume leverage, savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment, partially offset by lower pricing. The 2017 outlook for global demand in air conditioning and refrigeration markets supports our expectation for low-single-digit growth for our Climate businesses. Turning to slide 12, Commercial and Residential Solutions' underlying sales were equal to the prior year as growth in food waste disposers and wet-dry vacuums offset declines in other businesses. Segment margin improved 370 basis points to 25.9% from the benefits of restructuring actions and the impact of the InterMetro divestiture. Favorable conditions in U.S. construction markets are expected to support our outlook for low-single-digit growth in fiscal 2017. Turning to slide 13, fiscal year 2016 was more difficult than we had expected, impacted by a significant and unprecedentedly long global industrial downturn that we expect to continue into 2017. Our automation businesses will remain under pressure from these market headwinds while our commercial businesses will benefit from favorable conditions in global air conditioning and refrigeration and from construction markets in the United States and Asia. Considering these factors, we provide the following guidance for fiscal year 2017. Net and underlying sales will be down 1% to 3%, with the Automation Solutions platform down 4% to 7% and the Commercial and Residential Solutions platform up 2% to 4%. The Automation Solutions platform will be comprised of our current Process Management segment and the remaining businesses from the Industrial Automation segment, while the Commercial and Residential Solutions platform will be comprised of the businesses within our current Climate Technology and Commercial and Residential Solutions segments. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.50, which compares to earnings per share on a continuing basis and excluding divestiture gains of $2.45 in 2016 and $2.81 in 2015. The 2017 EPS guidance also excludes any impact from the pending acquisition of Pentair's valves and controls business. And now I'll turn it over to Mr. David Farr. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much, Craig. And in case you guys don't realize, Craig is rooting for the Cleveland Indians tonight to win and take the World Series, so he's not totally paying attention right now. He's focused on the Cleveland Indians. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. Again, it's a good way to finish a very challenging global industrial world that was not an easy year, but a very challenging year nonetheless. And I think we continue to execute and get our position in the right condition for better growth in the future. I want to thank all the employees, the corporate leaders, the OC members for their support and your effort this year. We got a lot done in a very tough global business environment, which has been challenging for us for the last two years. And with a good finish on the fiscal 2016 in the fourth quarter, even though sales were down, margins were close to record levels from last year. We had strong cash flow, we had good conversion. In the quarter we also announced the cash sale for Network Power, cash sale for Leroy-Somer CT, generating over $5.2 billion of cash, and an agreement to purchase the Pentair valves and control business for $3.15 billion. As Craig mentioned, most likely we'll get the divestiture done by the end of this quarter. We clearly are driving, trying to get the valves control business closed by the end of this quarter. We still have to get global government approvals on that acquisition, and we're moving forward with that. That acquisition is uniquely strategic to us relative to our end markets, our solutions package and our ability to really integrate that and fit it well within our broad global customer offering. And so we're very excited about the opportunity there to generate future growth, earnings and cash flow. We executed for the second year on restructuring. Restructuring, remember, was down from the prior year because we had very high levels of restructuring in fiscal 2015, but still over $100 million of restructuring throughout the year in 2016, and the savings are flowing through. We nearly maintained a 17% operating profit this year despite sales being down 9%, which is quite a major task given a big drop-off that we saw in the Automation Solutions business. We had strong cash flow again this year, better than last year when you take out the cost of doing the repositioning, excellent conversion. So we're exiting the year with two strategic divestitures, one unique strategic acquisition, strong balance sheet, good cash position, and we have a very good vision where we see things unfolding here for the next 12 months. You now have the new GAAP P&L and balance sheet for Emerson. I'm sure you'll have a lot of questions about it. We will supply five years of history in the end report. We'll also give you a very good 2014, too, and I think three-year details. And it will give you a chance to start to understand the new Emerson. Also we'll start giving out the sales and orders relative to our platform, the two platforms, Automation Solutions and then also the Commercial Residential Solutions. So we'll start giving some information, Craig has the information, he'll start feeding it out to you, and we'll get more to you as we go forward here in the 10-K, and then also we'll give more as we report our first quarter in fiscal 2017. We made a decision to give you a little bit more insight into what we see for next year given what the new company is structured, what the new P&L looks like, what the new balance sheet looks like. Right now we see underlying sales down 1% to 3% with Automation Solutions being still in a challenging mode down 4% to 7%, which will be a third year in a row that Automation Solutions is down. Our Commercial Residential business has turned the corner and has grown, and we expect that will continue to grow 2% to 4% next year. Both will deliver solid operating margins and both will be better. Restructuring around the Automation Solutions will continue but at a little lower level, excluding our integration of Pentair valves and control. Some minor restructuring going on underneath the Commercial Residential Solutions, but primarily we're making significant increased investments in the infrastructure to create best cost locations, to create a more efficient structure within the new Commercial Residential underneath Bob Sharp and Jim Lindemann. A lot of integration work going on there. And then eventually when we get clearance from the governments we'll get integration work under Pentair valves and control. We're ready to go. We already have our day one through six month plans ready to implement and working very, very hard on it, so a lot underway relative to our execution around this acquisition. So we feel good about how we finish the year, feel good about how we're going into our position relative to our repositioning effort. With EPS it's all about how do we maintain or have a slight increase in EPS next year. We gave you the range of $2.35 to $2.50 but we're very much focused, can we deliver some moderate, low-single, negative-single growth in underlying sales and execute better margins and deliver a little bit better earnings per share. We're very much focused on running this business now that we have the repositioning effort underway. It's been a tough market. There's not a lot of growth out there. It's a challenging market, but we know where we have to go. From our perspective, from the management team, we downsized around the world, both in the operating units and also the corporate units. We have a very solid team ready to execute around our plan for 2017 and 2018 and beyond. Restructuring, our cost position is in pretty good shape right now. There's always more restructuring to do, but we've got the majority of the big heavy lifting behind us, when you exclude the Pentair valves and control, but we've really got our position from our perspective in good shape. We're very much focused on trying to, again, bring in some additional acquisitions in 2017. We will end from the positioning and the acquisition, we'll end up with over $4.5 billion of cash positioned in the right place to invest, and so we'll continue to look on at the small bolt-ons, strategic-type acquisitions, to rebuild our base as we've talked about back to $20 billion within this five-year time period, getting our operating cash flow back to over $3.2 billion, which will allow us to drive a modest increase in dividends and get that free cash flow to \u2013 dividend payout ratio back under 50%. We've showed that plan, we did that in the Morgan Stanley conference a couple weeks ago, a couple months ago. We are on course to make sure we execute around that vision, so that's what we're all about. I want to thank the organization for the work they've done the last 12 months. We have changed a lot in Emerson in the last 12 months, from the change in the businesses, from the restructuring, to delivering very solid earnings and cash in a very challenging year, to improving our cost structure, to making a big acquisition hopefully we'll get finalized at the end of this calendar year, and then moving forward in a new company. Yes, it's a smaller company. It's a very profitable company, but a company that's well-positioned I think to grow and recover as global investments start happening again. So I like where we are right now. We had a good session with the board today, talking about how we wrapped up the year and where we're going to go forward, but I think we're in really good shape. We have a very, very difficult first quarter. We had a very good first quarter last year. The Automation Solutions business is looking at probably down 10% sales in the first quarter. If you've been watching this, the orders for the last several, six or eight months, the orders have been down around the 10%, 12%, 13% range. They've got to get through that, and so we have a very difficult first quarter from Automation Solutions, and we know that and we're built for that. We'll try to get some more restructuring done, but that's the facts at this point in time. That's built into our forecast, and the year will get better as we go forward. But clearly we've got to get through the next two or three months here, finish the divestitures, make the acquisition, and then move forward with the new company. So with that, I'll open up the door and the windows and the phone lines and let people talk. Ask any questions you want. No one gave me the questions ahead of time. I tried to call CNN, but unfortunately they didn't return my phone call. So I don't have the questions ahead of time. And Craig was so focused on reading the damn box score from the baseball game, which they lost the other night, that he didn't give me any questions, either. So with that, we'll open up the phone lines and take questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You up first, Julian? Operator : And the first question today comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You didn't send me the question, did you, Julian? Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): No, no, no, not intentionally, that's for sure. On the guidance of sort of margins to be I think up in both platforms in 2017, maybe just give some color on what the incremental savings are this year in your continuing business. And also maybe expand a little bit on the restructuring spend. As you said, it was about $96 million continuing last year. Is it sort of more like $60 million, $70 million this year? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's going to be \u2013 on an incremental savings standpoint, I mean, the numbers we laid out, and we have those; we laid them out \u2013 let me give you the numbers, Julian. We'll give you the numbers before we get off this call here, but we laid out \u2013 I can't the exact numbers the restructuring saved, I don't have them on a piece of paper right in front of me, but I can give you the delta year-to-year. On the restructuring number that we're going to turn around $50 million in the core company and somewhere between $50 million to $70 million once we start getting the valves and controls business approval and integrated. So go ahead, Frank. You can go ahead and tell him. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: So built into the plan next year is about $100 million \u2013 this year, I should say \u2013 of op savings. A lot of that is carryover from actions already taken, and we've got, as Dave said, about $50 million of new spend in the plan. And given the timing and the nature of the actions, we'll see about half of that flow through the end of the year. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, yeah. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you. And then just on the top line, so your continuing sales, organic guidance is a decline of about 2% at the midpoint. The orders on a continuing basis are falling in September about 8% to 9% organically. So maybe just give us some help around when you think those orders may level out, and particularly in that Process Automation piece. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, the key here, Julian, is Automation Solutions. I mean, clearly, right now as we look at the early stage of October, they were slightly better in orders in October. Automation Solutions were pretty much in line to what they were last month that we put out there \u2013 I mean, I'm sorry, Commercial and Residential Solutions, I apologize. I mean, right now we're saying late third quarter we'll start seeing a positive Automation Solutions, and so they'll start bottoming out and coming up in the new calendar year. That will be the key issue to watch. And I mean from our perspective right now we're hoping to have obviously positive Automation Solution orders by that number above the line by the time we get out of this year, and that's where the bet is here right now, and that's how we see everything laying out basically from our customers and our initial reactions. So that's the $15 billion question right there is where does that number turn up? Right now, we're saying it's going to start getting better in the early calendar year of 2017 but will not go positive until late, on the Automation Solutions standpoint, until late 2017. That's what it is. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Is that true of the sort of the MRO piece within Process? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. MRO has got to lead us up. I mean, small projects, what we call brownfield projects, additions into a current facility, they will come but that will come later. We've got to start seeing some turnaround. We're starting to see some early indication right now in some of the international markets. The market we have not seen stabilize right now is North America. And so that's the marketplace that we have to see that stability and we have to see them starting to spend some MRO in this North America market. And how long can they keep deferring that? I think we will not get clarity until that first calendar quarter from our major investors as they finish out their fiscal year, as they see their cost structure. So that's why I think the first fiscal quarter, which is the fourth calendar quarter, will be very difficult because I think our customer base will be tight, tight, tight with cash and be concerned. So that's where I see it right now, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Take care. Operator : Our next questioner today is Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Hello, Andrew. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, Dave, Good afternoon. How you doing? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, my friend. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): So China, I mean it looks like it turned a bit for you in the quarter, especially in Climate markets. Did you see an end to inventory destocking in Climate? Or did business just simply get better there? And what do you think for 2017 in China? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: There's not one simple \u2013 I mean China's a big country, big market. Clearly what we see right now are some of the investments around the environment, some of the investments around energy efficiency, we're seeing the Climate Technology investments or the Automated Solutions \u2013 I mean Commercial Residential Solutions, those markets are picking back up for us. They've continued here early on in this fiscal quarter, first quarter. So we see that market turning. Now obviously, after being down real negative for a while, you get a nice bounce. And that's where we are right now. So we're expecting moderate growth in China in our Commercial Residential Solutions business for 2017. Our orders in Automation Solutions have stabilized in China. Again, you keep in mind the markets we serve in China are not necessarily in the big oil and gas new fields and things like that. We're looking at efficiency. We're looking at power plants. We're looking at programs to help incremental capacity and save energy and things like that. Those markets are actually starting to solidify in China. So we are cautiously optimistic about China, that we will see low-single-digit positive growth in 2017. Now ask me that question in February, I might give you a different answer. But right now that's what we're seeing based on our indication of orders the last couple of months and our customers. So I feel good about that. The other market I feel good about will be Europe. If you look at the new Emerson, the Automation Solutions, the Commercial Residential, Europe grew last year and I think will grow again this year. Those are the two positive markets. And then it gets real short after that. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): That's helpful, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Look, you've obviously done a lot of restructuring in the last couple of years. You've done a great job of holding margin, as you said. At some point as you know you start cutting into the bone a bit. So how much low-hanging fruit do you have if markets don't improve? How much more can you hold margin? I mean, you've got that again for 2017 where you've got the clientele (26:45) and it looks like you're going to hold margins again. So can you talk about that, Dave? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, I can talk about that. The key issue, let's break it down in two pieces and I'll give you a total perspective from a CEO industry perspective, okay? On the Commercial Residential Solutions, Bob Sharp and Jim Lindemann laid out a plan. They're integrating these businesses today. And we see some opportunities in between the creases, let's say, to improve plant efficiency, plant costs, distribution, things like that. So we see the ability to basically get a point out of cost structure and improve the profitability by a point over the next couple of years, get some working capital out, take some of that money, invest it, try to continue to grow that business but also let some of that money flow through. So there we're looking at by emerging, putting the business together, some inefficiencies that we have today by separate business, by putting them together. But once that's done we've got to grow because the cost structure will be very, very, very, very good. On the Automation Solutions standpoint, we probably have $40 million, $50 million of the core company left. And then you've got some very, very difficult issues there. From the \u2013 just starting to go after things you don't want to go after because it jeopardize the future technology innovation and the value base of this company. The acquisition of Pentair valves and controls gives us a chance to go after even more. And that's why we're going to be looking at $50 million to $75 million in the first year, depending on when we get this done, on the restructuring. And there's potentially we'll do even more than that in the next two years. So the acquisition of Pentair valves and controls gives us a chance to refresh opportunities for us to integrate again a much larger business. You take the $7 billion Automation Solutions business today, you add $1.6 billion in there, you have a chance to do things. Now if the economy doesn't grow and we continue to struggle for growth, hence you're going to continue to see acquisitions. That's why you're seeing acquisitions. U.S. companies have been going through a lot of restructuring, taking costs out. We're running at pretty high levels of profitability for the level of sales we have, and hence that's why you're seeing acquisitions. That's why you're going to see that continue I think in the short term, unless there's some kind of growth in 2017 which I don't see at this point in time. So if this thing keeps going and gets sloppy, then we're going to have to add to our acquisition pool, and that's why we're going to be looking at an additional $3 billion to $4 billion of acquisitions over the next two or three years to continue to feed our chance to reposition and restructure and derive top-line growth through acquisitions, because the core economic growth we do not see coming through for the next couple of years. That's what this CEO sees from a cost perspective and growth perspective. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): That's great, Dave. Thanks very much. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Operator : Our next questioner today is Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Hello, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hey, Dave. How's it going? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Not too bad. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I did send my questions to Craig. He's lying, he's got them. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Well, he's working that box score, Nigel, you know that. He's working that box score. He's got some kind of voodoo baby down there he's playing around with trying to make sure they win tonight. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I'm sure, I'm sure. So all's fair in love and war. So Automation Solutions is down 4% to 7%. Obviously, how do we think about \u2013 the legacy sort of industrial automation stuff flat this quarter. You've got some components of that segment performing very well. Process I'm assuming will be below the 4% to 7%. So how do we think about the various moving pieces within that portfolio? And then valves and controls obviously comes in as an acquisition line, but is the kind of down 4% to 7% the same for that portfolio... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: ... or was that a bit later cycle? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No, Nigel, think about the chart that we showed you, that I gave you when we did the Pentair valves and control chart, the $260 billion market we broke down in three pieces. You had the Process, you had the high grade and then you had the discrete. You think about \u2013 remember that chart we handed out? Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: The Process side will be worse than negative 4% to 7% and our Hybrid/Discrete business will basically be flat growth next year. And therefore that's how we get the 4% to 7% combined, okay? We're looking at the marketplace, that $260 billion marketplace that we showed you when we did the valves and control acquisition. The Process piece will be down more than 4% to 7% and the other Hybrid piece will be flat or slightly up, maybe 1%, plus or minus 1%. And that's why the Process business will be a little bit more negative than we said, the 4% to 7%, to your point. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then the Pentair portfolio, does that come in at a similar kind of organic decline as the Emerson Process business or... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think, as I said when we did the acquisition, I have a little bit more pessimistic view of what that business is going to look like for the next 12 to 18 months. One, the order pace has not been very good. Secondly, there's going to be a lot of disruption and integration work going on I think that will negatively impact this business for 12 to 18 months. Once it comes on board, it will be the same growth rate as the overall Process business, but I think as you look at 2017 and 2018, I think they're going to be a little bit less than the underlying what we call Process Automation business. And we're going to be creating that problem ourselves probably. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then a quick one, Dave. The comments on acquisitions are obviously very interesting. You've made it very clear that you're done with the portfolio disposals, you've got one more coming up. But looking at the tools markets, there's been a fair amount of consolidation talked about in the tools market. You've got a great plumbing tools business, high multiples are getting paid. Does that make you kind of re-think about your portfolio as maybe perhaps one or two more sales to accelerate your acquisitions into Automation? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. I think that from within our tool business base right now there's some good leverage across some of the other core Automation and Solutions businesses. There's some good leverage there so if there's no strategic lever between on the Commercial Residential and Automation Solutions, we will get out of that business. But right now the portfolio that's remaining, other than the one storage business, there's some good leverage of channel, leverage of technologies, leverage of things that we can do that we will stay pat. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. Thanks, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Take care, Nigel. Operator : Our next questioner today is Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Steve Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, just maybe starting you talked about margins up in 2017. You just walked through the restructuring side of that story, but maybe complete that bridge in terms of how you're thinking about it. Assuming that you do get that 1% to 3% low organic growth, what about price versus cost? Material costs? What about other productivity? What about other puts and takes that get you to stay positive next year? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You want me to give you all the answers? Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Well, Dave, it simplifies everybody's life right now. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You know me, I'll give you my interpretation. I'll give you what I feel, okay, Steve? Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yep. Yeah, that's good. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I'll give you the best feel I have at this point in time. I fundamentally believe right now we are about as close as we've been for a while relative to this price cost pressures, being pricing has been, as you know, has been basically flat for us I think last year, last two years basically slightly up, slightly down, 0.1%, 0.2%. Now we've been able to offset that with stronger net material inflation. What I see coming into us right now, either this quarter or next quarter, is our price-cost ratio pressures are going to build. And so we're factoring into higher cost reduction efforts within the company because I wouldn't be surprised if we do not go red for one or two quarters on our price-cost ratios in 2017. I've told people at the Fed this same issue. There is inflation brewing relative to specific skill set, material deflation is slowing down if not starting to come up, and our pricing capability is not that strong right now because there's plenty of capacity out there and there's not a lot of demand. So the pressure is building on this whole price-cost scenario. So what we're building in right now in our plan is basically to stay neutral because I think if you let it run its course we're going to be slightly red on a price-cost situation. We have to increase our cost reductions, and it's going to be primarily around cost reduction. Productivity is going to be tough. We'll probably be 1% or 2% next year on productivity. We're better than the U.S. economy, but there's not a lot of growth out there. So it's extremely hard to get a lot more productivity without some additional growth. So right now we're having to ramp up our cost reductions around sort of discretionary things and keep the place kind of tight. So that's how I see the unfolding next year. We're going to get \u2013 we've got the savings from the restructuring we did last year, early this year. But in order to hold our margins and improve our profitability next year, we're going to have to come up with more stronger discretionary cost savings because I think price-cost will be working against us. That's my call. I'm sure you've not heard that from anybody, but that's my call Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: No, and since you're being so generous answering questions, let me ask you one more here, which is \u2013 and this one, you continue to get in advance because we ask it every time. So you talk about Pentair valves and controls... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Are you telling me you gave me this question ahead of time? Is that what you're telling me? Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I'm telling you we ask you the same question over and over again. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So it's good. So... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I'm a slow learner. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Pentair valves and controls, you talk about it being uniquely strategic to generate future growth for the company. Clearly there are a lot of people in the market who are having more skepticism about understanding that. Since you've had more time with it, is there anything in there that you can kind of point to that sort of provides a little more encouragement to you and maybe to investors that, hey, this is something that people should appreciate more than they do? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We've now had the opportunity to talk to our customer base about this. I mean the most strategic opportunity for us is that we can get them into a lot bigger customers that they couldn't get into themselves. We can get them on to large projects which we win, which they never won because they don't have the control system or the whole package. We can now offer a much larger service package. We can service a whole host of product for our customers so now we can be this sort of the core service organization for them. The leverage across the total portfolio, now people, all they want to do is think about that's a dumb valve, then that's very narrow thinking. You could say, oh yeah, that's not that strategic. But what we're talking about is, when we go out and bid for projects, when we go out for the type of packages we get with our large global customer base, we now will be able to offer them a much larger solution both up front and the service and tie that technology together. So we see a lot more growth synergies from that leverage of our organization on a global basis than a person who only thinks, only thinks about a valve company standalone operation. And I think in five years people will look back and say, hey, you did get a lot more growth than we thought you would. But that's what I see right now. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Fantastic. Thanks, Dave. Good luck. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You take care, Steve. Operator : Our next questioner today is Gautam Khanna from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey. So a couple of questions. First, I just wanted to maybe better understand the comment on lower pricing at Climate Tech in the quarter. Was this just surcharge-related linked to material cost? Or was it actual incremental price pressure or something we should be concerned about? Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: No, Gautam. It's not. It's not incremental price pressure. Again, it relates back again to \u2013 again, we talked about this before. Most of the OEMs are on some kind of contractual matrix-type pricing. So as commodities go up or down, pricing is adjusted. So in this environment when commodities are low, pricing goes down to match that. So there's a bit of a lag occasionally, but that's what the impact is. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just to follow on Nigel's question about the split at the remaining Industrial Automation business. Can you remind us of how much of the remaining business is linked directly to oil and gas? If I recall, it was pretty small, something like 10%, 15%, but I want to make sure of that. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's pretty small. Yeah, I mean, I would say we're \u2013 by the way, when we report a new segments or new \u2013 it's going to be one. It's going to be called Automation Solutions. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah, no, I hear you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're going to get one number, Automation Solutions. So I was all of you guys' thinking right now. We gave you a chart relative to our total Process business, Automation Solutions, Hybrid and Discrete. You may want to learn those numbers because that's how we're going to be talking about this business, Automation Solutions. So I was being nice to whoever asked me that question. But from my perspective we are looking at one company as being integrated, period. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Understood. But in the splits in terms of the growth rates, I guess the point is at the legacy Remainco Industrial Automation business, most of that is not related \u2013 it's not linked to the same markets, the legacy process businesses, and that's why... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: There are some crossovers. There's some crossovers. They sell the chemical business. Yeah, they sell the Hybrid space, the pharmaceuticals. So there are some crossover spaces there. And so you have to \u2013 so that if you think about we gave the chart and so you can see how that breaks down across those three entities. And some of those businesses do a small piece. Small piece will go into the core process marketplace. It's a small piece of that. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's not going to... Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's not going to wag the tail, as you say. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Understood. Understood. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: And then just below the line, could you calibrate us on items like corporate expense this year, what we should put in there for buybacks this year and maybe any other moving pieces below the line? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, I think the corporate number, I mean I'm just talking about a corporate number. I don't have a number. I mean the corporate number, we'll give it to you later. I don't have that. We're still going through this. Let's get through all the closures and stuff like that and divestitures as we get into the year. So we'll give you a better feel for that in February at the Investors conference. You dial in about $500 million of share repurchase. We'll have some pension headwind this year. Interest rates did go down, if you didn't notice. They went down. And so we'll have, what, what's the pension headwind is what... Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: $40 million. $40 million to $50 million. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: $40 million to $50 million headwind for us as a corporation. Those are the two issues right there. Currency right now is kind of neutral. And so the two headwinds for us are really going to be that, and then we'll see how things settle down from a corporate standpoint once we get all the divestitures and acquisitions done. And we'll give that number to you in February. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks a lot, guys. Good luck. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Take care. Operator : Our next questioner today is Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Please go ahead. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good afternoon, everyone. How you doing today? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: How you doing, Rob? You got those kids buying Emerson stock yet, I hope? Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: We're levering up. Hope the SEC is not listening. Okay. In any event. Moving on, earning... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You know I'm just kidding, Rob. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Earnings is earnings but cash is cash, okay? So from that standpoint, could you talk, Dave, about your cadence for operating cash and free cash flow generation over the next couple of years? And kind of what are your \u2013 given what you're planning for a difficult environment, can you give investors some confidence that the dividend remains sacrosanct in the context of this transitional period? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Do I need to like break my left leg, rip it off and give it to you or something like that, or my right leg? Or \u2013 so go back, seriously. And by the way, I was being facetious. People on the phone listening, I did not tell Rob to buy stock for his kids. All those people, since the SEC has no humor. For 2017 there's two numbers you need to think about for 2017. This was driven into our heads across the organization : $2.5 billion operating cash flow and $2 billion free cash flow, a number that's pretty tight to our modeling and we're going to manage according \u2013 as the organization is talking about it. So if we can beat it, we can beat it, but that would put us at 62% of dividend to free cash flow cover, okay? Then as we move into 2018 and 2019, we're not assuming any big breakout or anything like that, but we're trying to get back into adding about $100 million of cash to $150 million of operating cash flow per year. Now our plan is to continue to keep the dividend going up modestly, as I told the people, you know, two pennies. We'll have share repurchase of around $500 million per year. That allows us to basically keep the dividend \u2013 the actual payments flat or slightly down. And so we'll see as we get into right now 2020, 2021, we'll be back down toward that 50% level. If we do not make any more additional acquisitions, that's what's going to happen. If we make additional acquisitions on top of Pentair, our game plan is to get that number back \u2013 our operating cash flow back up to $3.2 billion, spending around $600 million of capital. That gets us back into the high-40%s free cash flow to dividends from that perspective. So our model right now says that we'll continue to make acquisitions, we'll continue to integrate them, generate cash from those. We'll continue to buy stock back and continue to increase our dividend modestly, so that's what we're looking at right now. And our model looks at do we do nothing other than Pentair, and if it does that, we'll get closer to 50%. If we do some additional deals, which we want to do, then we'll obviously get back under 50% in the next five years. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then just as a follow up, I mean, obviously Julian asked kind of a line-in-the-sand question for Automation Solutions in terms of the order trends, the cadence for the year. But usually kind of how you lay out the year is basically you guide fiscal 1Q and then get a peek into next year kind of for your full-year guidance. You've given us the full-year guidance now, given all the puts and takes. I guess, looking at kind of known-unknowns going into February, Dave, I mean, what are the three or four key things that you want to come in hat in hand in February to have a better sense of kind of the macro variables so that you can have a better sense of whether you're going to actually grow earnings next year? What are the kind of three or four things we should be looking for, given your increased line of sight, February versus now? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: The number one issue, the number two issue, and one, two and three will be the trend line of Process \u2013 or Automation Solutions orders, in particular North America orders. We need that chart \u2013 we need that line coming up, like I thought it was going to do last year. I made the call, and I was wrong. We need that line coming up towards that flat line, that zero line, and that's going to be very \u2013 that's number one, two and three. And so I haven't totally mapped it out yet. I want to see how the next couple months \u2013 right now, when a lot of things happen, as we close out our fiscal year, the first couple months are tough with our customer base, so I want to see what happens here October, November, December and January in order pace. That will give me a clear idea how much has flushed through the system, and then we need to see that trend line coming up. If we do not see a pretty good slope of those orders in particular in North America, then we'll have a hard, hard time growing earnings next year. But that's the top couple of issues right there. The second issue from our perspective will be \u2013 or the third or fourth issue will be I'm watching the Commercial Residential in Asia. As Asia continues to grow for us in the Commercial Residential, and then we \u2013 because I think we'll see a pretty good transitional growth in North America. I think we'll still see pretty good growth there. If Asia continues to grow for us in Commercial Residential Solutions, then I'll feel good about that segment holding up throughout 2017. So that will be the key thing I'm watching for those guys. And then clearly Automation Solutions' order trending line up and the lines pointing towards hitting that cross point sometime late in our fiscal 2017. And that's what we'll be watching like a hawk. You know we're (48:02) too so... Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Donna Brazile signing off. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. That's good. That's really good. Operator : Our next question today comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Hey, Jeff. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Hey. How's it going, Dave? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. Pretty good. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Good. Good. Hey. Two questions. The first one, just back to Process and I don't know, just trying to kind of figure out the secret decoder ring here for what the turn might look like. Are you seeing MRO turning in other regions outside the U.S., so is there something to glean from the pace of activity in other areas that give us a little bit of roadmap to think about how North America and the U.S. market could play out? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I don't think the other markets really have anything to do with North America. MRO in Europe, MRO in Asia Pacific has been decent, trending \u2013 Europe's been positive and Asia Pacific's starting to trend the right way. They don't really drive North America. I mean, that's the wild card we've got to watch and when we start saying North America Automation Solutions, so get the phrase right there, Automation Solutions trending the right way, it's going to be the key phrase for us. If you don't see us saying that, then we're really going to start struggling and we will not be able to deliver what we laid out in that range earlier this year. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yeah. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: But I really think we will. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yeah, I was thinking a handoff from CapEx to MRO... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah... Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And how that played out in other areas is maybe... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No, it's a different game plan here. North America, the way the multinationals going to do, because they have a lot more control, in North America they cut here deeper, and it's just the way that it is. When you think about labor and restructuring, there's always more in North America because we have a lot more flexibility. That's the same thing here. So around MRO, there's no decoder rings relative to, you say, relative to what happens in Europe or what happens in Latin America or what happens in Asia Pacific. It's a whole different game, okay? Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then on the M&A side, Dave, do you see a relatively active pipeline? Are there chunky things that you might do? There's a big water asset that's for sale, filtration asset that's for sale now for example. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We never got into that business because there was a good reason for it, so I'll pass on that one. A lot of hype around water filtration. No, I think there are opportunities out there. I think you're going to see opportunities for us emerge and I think we have capabilities that will emerge as we get into the new calendar year. We're highly focused right now on trying to get all the approvals for \u2013 when you think about, we've got two major divestitures and a major acquisition underway. There are a massive number of approvals we have to get around the world on three of those capabilities. So right now, we've sort of got our tools down and there are opportunities out there, we're working them, but we'll really gear back up once we get all these approvals done. But there are... Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Are there any... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: ... opportunities out there. I wouldn't worry about that. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Are there any particular snags on those approvals that you're seeing? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. It just takes time. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yeah, all right. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean, it takes time. And I mean have you heard of any approvals flying through quickly? Operator : Our next question today comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, John. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, Dave. Going back to the trajectory of Process turning in the second half of fiscal 2017... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Automation Solutions. I will not be using the word Process today. Sorry. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Automation Solutions, sorry. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Automation Solutions, John. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, I got it. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Two platforms. Automation Solutions and Commercial Residential Solutions. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I've got the tags in front of me. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. Check, Automation Solutions. Okay. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: But going back to the trajectory of Automation Solutions, the line crossing, I guess, in orders and then the results in the second half of 2017 per what you're aspiring, is there a threshold level of oil prices that you think have to sustain itself or maybe move to a certain level to kind of get the... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Customers that you've been talking with to kind of stimulate it here, or no? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's stability here. I think it's stability between the mid-$40s up to the mid-$50s right now. I think that's what \u2013 they just need to see where they are. Our customer needs to see where they are from a cash flow standpoint, a cost structure standpoint. This industry \u2013 our end customer in this industry has been going through a lot of restructuring also for the last 18 months, and so they're trying to get stabilized like we're trying to get stabilized. So I think the key issue for me, John, is stability. And we've seen a little bit of stability, though it's drifted back down again on the oil side, but I mean the key thing for us is to see some stability around that, not some high-level mark. And I think that way these guys can plan their cash flow, they can plan their capital allocation from a dividend standpoint or share repurchase, whatever they're trying to do, and then allocate back to capital. And I'm hoping that we'll see some more capital reallocate back to MRO versus some finishing off of projects like they had last year. Okay? John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And so is there a way to then sort of drill down into ultimately the reasons that you feel that \u2013 sort of going back to February, right, when we thought that things were going to turn and they ultimately didn't, why is it that things are going to turn in the second half of 2017? Is it just because we've been in a downturn for much longer or you actually are seeing more stability? Or what is it? Obviously, the comparison issues I get. But I think you're talking more on the fundamental side. So I'm just trying to go... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Back to what are the reasons for the progress in your confidence? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: John, you've got to go back and think about where the price of oil was. It was not \u2013 it was trending. It was in the $50s and they made a call that it was go in the $20s. And it went down into $30. And the oil, our customer base did a quick reevaluation in the spring, summer about, oh, my God, how do I protect my capital structure? How do I protect all these things with a much lower oil price? So they cut capital much deeper than they said originally; they had told us in January, February, we get the early indications from them. So that's what happened there. Now we go forward here. Now we're out here sitting in late in the year, we're sitting here in the November time period, oil pricing and the gas prices have been stabilizing here for several months. And the trend line has been a little bit better. It does go up and down. They have now got a year behind them relative to their whole capital structure, some of the big projects had to get done. They cut really heavily on the day-to-day spending, and I think you're going to see that stability in the pricing if it stays that way and within a range, then you'll see some more money go back into the day-to-day capital. And that's the difference. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No, perfectly clear. Dave, you're sounding reasonably constructive on the European markets. And I know you're a steward of geopolitical events. Are you not \u2013 I mean a couple of companies have called out European softening even of late. Are you not a little bit concerned about Brexit now actually moving forward, possibly causing a European improvement scenario to fizzle? Or... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, if you listened to me talk the last couple of times, I said Europe is weaker. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yep. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: All I said, Europe will grow. We grew this year. I think it will grow less in 2017 than it did in 2016. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: But I've been openly been telling people \u2013 and if anyone's hear me talk, they've heard me say Europe has definitely weakened. Europe is definitely growing. The euro is weaker, so again it's going to help our European operation. The euro went back down into the $1.09 to $1.10. If it gets back up to $1.15, it'll make it tougher. But it's definitely going to weaken. And I think the hoopla around Brexit is hoopla. And so I think from my perspective Europe will grow next year but it won't be as much growth as this year. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And just lastly, do you feel that China in terms of the levels it's achieved, is it sustainable? Or is it \u2013 because some are sort of concerned, is this just a function of Chinese stimulus that then goes away? I'm just \u2013 it sounds like you've got a little more conviction in the China market right now. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think based on what we're seeing in order patterns, based on our customer inputs, based on what we started seeing the last couple of months, as I've said earlier, I think China will grow low single digit, from zero to 2%, 3%. And that's where I see it right now. And if someone asked me the question a couple of calls back about in February, what would make me feel better relative to your forecast, I think that's \u2013 China, Asia Pacific is the number two thing I would say, after one, two and three were our Automation Solutions orders. But China order pace and sales pace will be the number two thing in that case. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, and low single digits seems like a pretty reasonable hurdle. So thank you much. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's better than shrinking. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Exactly. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much, John. Operator : Our next questioner today is Deane Dray from RBC. Please go ahead. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good afternoon, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Could we go back to your free cash flow targets for 2017? It looks like you've got a $500 million CapEx plan that's embedded in that. That looks like it's up 12% year-over-year, but I'm not sure that... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not. We did $523 million last year, John \u2013 or sorry \u2013 Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : No, no, no. I meant for looking for 2016, I'm not sure that's a comparable number. It looks like a $447 million number. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: $447 million is the new Emerson. We'll be flat basically on a comparable basis there. We have an obligation. We still own the \u2013 accounting, we had the disc ops, but we still own the businesses, so I'm actually still getting cash and I'm having to spend money. Contrary to what the county told me, I still own these businesses and I've still got the deed of control. Yes, there's been discontinued operations. I will get the cash and we have some capital spending obligations, so it's going to be around $500 million next year with that, from that perspective. Okay? Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Where's that money being spent? If you had just kind of big buckets, how would you describe that? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Incrementally the biggest pockets is we're freeing up capital to go into the Commercial Residential Solutions business, relative to the whole efficiency thing that I was talking about earlier. So we basically have several new facilities being built in best-cost locations. We're re-laying out some facilities, we're going to consolidate some facilities. So of that core business, $50 million is going to go to the discontinued operations business around that number, and then we'll have $450 million going to the Emerson remaining businesses, and a big chunk of that will be going into that work around \u2013 that Jim Lindemann and Bob Sharp are doing relative to the Commercial Residential organization. We also have some capacity going in for our compressor business in some best-cost locations. And then the other big chunk, there's nothing really big in Automation Solutions from the standpoint of it's just restructuring. And when you do restructuring and you do plant moves and stuff like that, you have to spend capital. So that's where the big chunks are, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So you did not get the memo that everyone got, that everyone's supposed to be cutting CapEx next year? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We've cut it pretty hard the last 18 months, and we actually generate pretty good cash flow too, Deane. You didn't get that memo? Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : No, it's fabulous cash flow. I just think it's impressive that you're adding capacity in this environment and that's a pretty bullish sign. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Well, the key issue, Deane, and I think you and I have talked about this, if we do not spend some money, you will not get productivity. And that's one of the signs it's a nasty loop right now, people in the industry. If you do not spend, you will not drive productivity. And that's where we're spending money, and we are growing some of our businesses and so they need capacity. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Exactly. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much, Deane. Operator : Our next question today comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Rich. Are you rooting for the Indians or are you rooting for the Cubs? Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : My friend, Mr. Rossman, I know, has got a vested interest in this, so... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, that's why I didn't get any of the questions, because he was working the line score again. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I know he is. He's emailing Francona as we speak, I'm sure, so... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: He's got the new lineup for him. Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.: Rich, it's all about dedication. I had a ticket for tonight's game, let me just tell you that. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Oh, my God. Rich, you got any Kleenex because I'm out of Kleenex this year. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Two quick ones. On Commercial & Residential Solutions, so a number of... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: All right. You get the ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. You win the prize. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : A number of building product companies have kind of squishy numbers, outlooks for particularly as it relates to more of the residential side of things here going into year-end. Just curious, I mean the order growth was decent in September on a trailing three-quarter basis. It seems like maybe you saw something different, but just curious underlying, particularly in North American market, how you characterize the state of the market right now in terms of order momentum and what you're seeing as you're going into year-end right now. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It really breaks down in different segments. But clearly inventories within what I'd call our sort of air conditioning, both the commercial and the residential channel, is pretty tight right now; they had late heat. And so that channel has gotten pretty tight, so some work going on there, so I would expect us to have a good first fiscal quarter there as they get the channel to where they need it, Rich. The other thing that's going on right now is there's a lot of changes relative to the efficiencies, to the refrigerants, and new products coming out from our customer base, so there's a lot of work being done on that which is driving some incremental growth for us. We're seeing that both in efficiency stuff going on in China, we see that across Asia and we're seeing that in Europe. So when any time you start seeing a lot of changes and some of the new targets coming out relative to the HSEs and the efficiencies, we get a benefit from that a little bit earlier than most people because they have to build up ahead of time. So we've see a decent pattern of growth. And then our housing business has held up reasonably well, but it's definitely stalled where it was. The growth rate has definitely stalled. And then a couple of our businesses within the Commercial Residential Solutions business actually get benefit from what I would call environmental problems like flooding and bad weather and stuff like that, and there's been some across North America here the last couple of months. And so things have gone our way there for a change. And so I think Bob and his team have got a great cost structure right now with all the restructuring, so they're driving very good margins. They've got a couple \u2013 the environmental things, the trend is going their way right now, so hopefully they make hay for this quarter because who knows what's going to happen next quarter there. So that's where we are right now. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And does the global summit a few weeks ago with the changes, the Montreal Protocol, I mean, does that have any tangible benefit the next couple of years or is that more out toward the beginning of next decade? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: In Europe and U.S., and we reviewed that with the board today, in fact, U.S. and Europe is definitely the next two years we'll start seeing some benefit there. The good thing about it is they now come down on what they would \u2013 they've agreed to certain standards and certain targets. So now our customer base, including us, can work a solution to get there. And so that's a good sign. That will help us, and we've been, as you know, one of the reasons we made the Helix investment the last couple of years up there in Dayton is because we know we're going to have to help drive some of these solutions, and that will help us probably late 2017 but more 2018 and 2019. The Asia ones, if you look at the standards, they're still out another 10 years. So our gut right there, they'll stay with old technologies. It will just drive the older technologies, not the newer technologies. But that definitely helps us because it's getting them set into the right direction for us. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then on valves and controls with the portfolio there, from an intelligence standpoint, you kind of talked a little bit about this earlier in the call. You did a pervasive sensing acquisition I think early or late September, early October, and I know that's an area of focus for you. How quickly can you increase the intelligence in the valves and controls portfolio? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think it will take us two to three years to really have an impact. But there's a lot of things around their actuation stuff. There's a lot of things around some of their safety in the Crosby area. There are areas that we can bring in some technology which we have, we can port over to them, so it will take us \u2013 there's a lot of things, you have standards you have to meet and pass, so it's going to take two or three years. But within this planning cycle, we'll start getting some benefit from that. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Have fun. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Take care, Rich. Operator : Our next questioner today is Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Steve. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Can you list another 10 factors that you're going to watch for next year's trend line order rate? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: 10 factors? I don't have that many... Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just giving Rob a little bit of a... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I know you're kidding. You can get me in trouble with the SEC if I give you 10 factors. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : On the free cash flow, so I guess if CapEx is not adjusting out the disc ops, how much of the free cash flow is coming from the disc ops? And then I assume that basically whatever cash you're going to lose there for the year forward would be replaced by the kind of solid cash accretion you're getting from Pentair, which I think is around $100 million to start for this year. Is that kind of the right equation? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, I think to cut it through simple, Frank and I, because first of all we don't own Pentair valves and controls, as you well know. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think we're going to be slightly north, when you push and shove everything back and forth, slightly north of $2.5 billion with Pentair. I think we can hold capital $500 million with Pentair-type stuff in there, with pluses and minuses across the whole company. So there's not much cash flow coming from the companies we're selling in the stub period, but we do have capital spending obligations. So I think overall I feel good that we will meet or slightly exceed the $2.5 billion operating cash flow. I have a lot of control over capital, as you can imagine, and so the $2 billion next year is a number that we've got locked in stone. And I told the board we're going to be monitoring that on a monthly basis and we'll be keeping the board informed and therefore we'll keep you guys informed, because that's a very important number to us. We want to make the 62% dividend to free cash flow ratio the worse that we see in my tenure, and then we'll start driving that back down in 2019. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then just on Process, how much of that do you think is \u2013 you mentioned North America MRO, et cetera. How much of that do you think is kind of pulled along with the chain of U.S. land rig count? I don't know how you \u2013 maybe you don't classify it that way. But obviously that's an area that people are a lot more optimistic on for next year. How much of a variable is that in the trend in the Automation \u2013 I didn't say Process Automation \u2013 the Industrial Automation business. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Automation Solutions. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Automation Solutions, sorry. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Steve, I think that for me the way our business mix up because we're not really down-well stuff. We have some stuff, but that's not going to drive our sales. What you really want to watch for us is the stability around the pricing of oil and the pricing of gas and within this range in the $45 to $55 range for oil and the equivalent level to gas. That number is very, very important to my customer base. Rig count is more down the road for us, and that means the overall health of the industry, that will help us, too. But in the near term, if I'm thinking 2017, stability in the price of oil and gas is pretty important relative to what I see our end customers will spend. And when they do their capital allocations, Steve, from based on, okay, I have to spend this much money for share repurchase, this much for dividend, this much for capital. How much do I have left over? That's how they're going to be calculating it. And I think that those are the numbers I'm watching right now and that stability's critical to me. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Congrats on the good execution and the cash. And obviously a pretty choppy and volatile year, so kudos to you guys for the execution there. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much, Steve. All the best to you. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yep. Operator : Our next questioner today is Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Securities. Please go ahead. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Good afternoon. Thanks for waiting. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Eli. I was just thinking about cutting you off, so you're lucky. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : I knew I wouldn't get my line in if you set up an Indian summer with the 80 degrees. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: If it wasn't that you're a St. Louis boy, I probably would have cut you off. But go Cards. Oh, we're not in the World Series, are we? Oh, shoot. Go ahead, Eli. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Two quick questions. One, with all the changes below the line, is there any structural change in what the tax rate is going to look like for the company as we go through all the shenanigans? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. If I was a good guy I'd put 31% down next year. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Yeah, but the structural doesn't change. Okay. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Eli, I'm going to give you \u2013 I'm going be honest with you, right? We will have some benefits as we go forward here in probably the first six months, or maybe the first quarter, on some things that we're going to get benefits for. So it might drive the tax rate down as real cash coming back for us. But the underlying tax rate, 31% is a good number. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Yeah, it was really the structural I'm looking at. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I know that. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : And with all the difficulties in the first half in Process \u2013 well, excuse me \u2013 Automation Solutions... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: All right, Eli. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Yeah, okay. Real question. How tough will holding profitability in that sector to fourth quarter levels, given the declines that we're looking at? I mean it's going to be a tale of two halves. First half's tough and hopefully you get bailed out in the second half. How tough is holding the profitability in the first half in Automation Solutions as we go through it? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Ain't going to happen. It's going to come down the first half. Restructuring, we've got more restructuring. Mike Train got a lot more restructuring done in the last three or four months in Automation Solutions. As you notice, our restructuring number went up. But his volume's going to be down 10% in the first quarter. And Mike's a good business leader, but he ain't that \u2013 he can't work miracles. So it's going to come down. And then we should start seeing that come back up as we move into the second quarter. So we're all hands on deck in this first quarter right now because Automation Solutions has got a very difficult \u2013 the order pattern's been weak for a while and we know the mix is not going to be good. So Bob's businesses are trying hard as possible, but that Automation Solutions going to be a tough number. So I think that's going to be the big issue for us. We're going to be definitely very weak in the first quarter in profitability, and we'll start coming back, because the restructuring's getting done. And we just \u2013 the volume's dropping so hard in this first quarter. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : But you should still be a double-digit-teen kind of number, I suspect. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Good. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're talking about margins, Frank. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, yeah. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : The operating profitability, yeah. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean, it's not \u2013 yes. It's still going to be \u2013 it'll still be better than most people would make in Automation Solutions but it's not an Emerson standard, you know. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Yeah. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: And they've got the restructuring done so the savings are flowing through. But it's going to be definitely the second half because of the way the sales will flow for that business, anyway. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : All right. Thank you very much. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You take care. All the best, Eli. We'll see you around town, okay, friend? Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Absolutely. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: And with that, we're going to wrap it up. I want to thank everybody. Appreciate the \u2013 asked you a couple of jokes here and there. And sorry if I picked on you too much, Rossman, but you've been so enamored with those Cleveland Indians, I haven't gotten a lot of Q&A out of you lately. So thank you, everybody. Take care and we'll see everybody around. And we'll definitely see everybody in February at our Investors conference. Take care now. Bye. Operator : The conference has now concluded.

Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : Good day ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Emerson's Investor Conference Call. During today's presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. This conference is being recorded today February 7, 2017. Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Craig Rossman, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead. Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you, Andrea. Today, I'm joined by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson and Frank Dellaquila, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's fiscal 2017 first quarter results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. I will start with the first quarter summary as shown on page 2 of the slide presentation. Sales in the first quarter decreased 4% to $3.2 billion with underlying sales down 3%. The first quarter results reflected mixed but generally improving global economic conditions. In the quarter, HVAC, refrigeration, U.S. and Asian construction markets were favorable, while the low price of oil continue to pressure spending in energy-related and some industrial markets. Solid margin performance and an income tax benefit of $0.07 per share resulted in earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.56, which reflects an increase of 22% versus the prior year. Overall, the first quarter results represent a solid start to the year. Improving demand conditions were evident across many of our served markets, particularly the Automation markets. We expect these trends to continue as evidenced by our January estimated trailing three-month order rate of 0% to 5% positive. Turning to slide 3, gross profit margin of 42.4% was flat for the prior year benefiting from cost reduction and containment actions across our businesses. EBIT margin was up 140 basis points, primarily due to savings from restructuring actions enacted over the past two years to align our cost structure to the economic conditions. Turning to slide 4, from a geographical perspective, generally improving conditions were evident with most notable improvements in the U.S., Asia and in Western Europe. Turning to slide 5, total segment margin was up 120 basis points primarily driven by benefits from prior year restructuring actions. Corporate and other was down largely due to favorable comparisons on stock compensation of $26 million. Operating cash flow from continuing operations of $410 million was up 6% versus the prior year and we continue to expect full year cash flow to be approximately $2.5 billion, flat to 2016. Capital spending remains at appropriate levels given the current business environment while trade working capital management remains a key focus resulting in a slight improvement versus the prior year. Turning to slide 6, Automation Solutions sales decreased 9% as spending in energy-related and general industrial markets remained at low levels in the quarter, but the pace of business improved during the quarter as reflected in our recent order trends including the January estimated trailing three-month figure, which is basically flat. Power, chemical and life sciences markets continue to provide growth, while improving MRO spending by oil and gas customers will provide a benefit for at least the next two quarters. Margin increased 80 basis points to 16.6%, primarily due to savings from prior year restructuring actions. We expect the Automation Solutions platform to remain under pressure in the second quarter with a continuation of improving market conditions during the remainder of the fiscal year. Turning to slide 7, Commercial & Residential Solutions platform sales increased 6% driven by strong demand in global air-conditioning and refrigeration markets and favorable conditions in U.S. and Asian construction markets. North American growth was led by strong growth in U.S. residential and commercial air conditioning. Asia was up 26% on broad strength in air-conditioning and refrigeration across most of the region, while China up 40% reflected a continuation of significant demand acceleration and the adoption of energy-efficient solutions. Margin improved 140 basis points to 19.9% from volume leverage and savings from restructuring actions as well as leverage benefits from the new platform structure. We expect favorable conditions in HVAC and refrigeration and U.S. construction markets to support our outlook for low- to mid-single digit growth in 2017. Turning to slide 8, taking into account the first quarter results and improving order trends, we are raising our 2017 outlook. Full year sales remain at down 1% to 3% but underlying sales are increasing to flat to down 2%, an improvement of 1% versus prior guidance. Unfavorable current translation will be approximately 1%. Within this guidance Automation Solutions platform sales will be down 5% to 7% with underlying sales down 3% to 5% excluding unfavorable currency translation of approximately 2%. And Commercial & Residential Solutions platform net and underlying sales will be up 3% to 5%. Earnings per share from continuing operations has been raised to $2.47 to $2.62 from the previous range of $2.35 to $2.50. This includes the $0.07 income tax benefit from the first quarter and continues to exclude any potential impact from the pending Valves & Control acquisition. And now, I'll turn it over to Mr. David Farr. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much, Craig. I want to welcome everybody for joining us this afternoon. I appreciate it. We just finished a 24-hour board meeting starting yesterday afternoon and going through this morning and just ending. Also, having our shareholders meeting. And fortunately all the proposition proposals passed the way the board recommended. That's a good situation. And for all your shareholders, I did get re-elected as a member of the board. Thank you very much. And for the board, for the members out there that don't like me being Chairman and CEO, fortunately the vote was a tad under 40% so I still will be the Chairman and CEO for a while here. I appreciate that. I want to also thank the whole organization across Emerson, around the world, as you all know, we've gone through a major transformation, repositioned the company, we've shaken up the organization. We've sold off the businesses. We've now finished the pure divestiture of Network Power and LSCT. We have received the cash and we're cleaning up all the final points there. We will finish that in the second quarter just like we did in the first quarter. And now we're focusing on the two core businesses. And as you saw, this is the first quarter reported, by themselves, executing around the new approach, the new strategy, the new organization. We are executing well within that and I want to thank the organization and the new people involved in this. And I also want to thank all the hard work that was done in the restructuring and the repositioning. And you can see in the profitability, it's flowing through and we saw that in the quarter. And that's a good time we're having the wind shift a little bit to our back and we're starting to see momentum change. Those are all the good things that are underway. Clearly, from our perspective, right now, we're still waiting for the final approval from the U.S. from the FTC on Pentair. We're hoping to get that sometime in the next couple of weeks and so we'll be able to close sometime by the end of March. We've already got approval from the EU. They're approved. We're in good shape there. And most places around the world we have approval. We're waiting for the U.S. government to finalize their review of the situation. As I look at the Automation Solutions business, as I've talked openly, as I've traveled and met with shareholders and I've had conferences, we could see the trend start turning with the stability of the price of oil, with the stability of our main customer base. We're starting to see a increase \u2013 slowly but surely increased demand around the world in key marketplaces and in key sectors, and that's a good thing. And we're starting to see that orders really turn into an improved pace of business, which should continue to happen as we go forward here for the rest of this year going into the second half and then into early 2018. On Bob Sharp's business, the Commercial & Residential they really started seeing improvement late last year in our fiscal quarter 2016. They had a very, very good start to this year with a sales and profitability and cash. And they have pretty good order pace still, and so we expect that business will continue to have a good growth around the world. They're seeing a pretty broad growth around the world, which is good. But in particular, I see the U.S., I see Asia and then also Europe really driving that. So I think a really good start for both businesses. One has already turned to growth; one is slowly getting their orders on pace and the lineup is, I would say, a quarter ahead of what we thought originally. And so we're liking that. And we'll have a lot of discussion around this at the Investor conference, which I believe is next week. Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.: Next week. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Next week in New York. I haven't decided which charts we're going to show, which charts we're going to exclude and which cameras will work and won't work in the auditorium. But those are all things that are flexible and based upon the CEO discretion. And so we'll see how that goes and we'll make that call when I get there in New York later this next week. Cash flow. It is a good quarter for cash flow, though it's always the lowest quarter for us. The first quarter, it's our lowest quarter in sales and lowest quarter in profits and lowest quarter in cash flow. But really, we got a good start to cash flow and we feel good about still being en route (11:03) to $2.5 billion operating cash flow for the year and it's very important as we look at what we want to get done internally, both through acquisitions and also in dividends and investments. So really good execution. The organization's set right now with the new organization, and you'll be exposed to some of those in the discussions we have in New York next week. We're seeing the right markets move for us right now and it's a good sign. But overall, great start to the year. I believe that if the markets continue to move the right way, then we'll continue to see a good progress as we go through this year. And that's why we've increased the year a little bit based on the first quarter performance and we'll move it as we go along here. But right now, we're going to take one quarter at a time. And we just had a good quarter, and now we move to that second quarter and see where we are. As you saw on the charts, we gave you an estimate for the January. We did get the January orders, which were slightly better on a three-month roll than we did last month and a little bit of improvement in the Automation side. A little bit of slowdown in the Commercial & Residential, but that's not unusual month-to-month in that business, as some of the orders are sometimes lumpy versus the prior year. So overall, good start and we're looking forward to have a strong second quarter. We have a lot of questions I want to get to. We have probably a record number of questions. I may not get to all of them, but we're going to start it here and I'm going to cut off my comments. I just want to thank the employees; I want to thank the organization for all they did here in the last three months. And they just delivered a very strong quarter to shareholders, and I know I appreciate what they've done on behalf of the whole OC and the board. So with that, I'm turning it over. First question. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, Dave. How you doing? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Andrew. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So, Dave, maybe you could step back and give us your view on the overall state of the world. You said maybe a year ago that we usually don't have more than five quarters of industrial recession, but then we proceeded to have two years of weakness. And given that it does seem like we came out of it a bit in your fiscal first quarter, do you think we should see a pretty decent snap back here over the next year, given the length in duration of the downturn? Or do you think there's enough uncertainty out there to ultimately make this sort of a slow recovery, as we've seen? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: That's a lot of ask. I mean since I've been pretty bad at forecasts in the last couple years, Andrew, I mean you remember I did call that we'd turn last year at this time. But \u2013 so keep that in mind. And from my perspective right now, I think that what we're seeing is the increased investments going on from a \u2013 just from pent-up \u2013 a situation for many years. We're starting to see some of that flow out both in the sort of in the Automation space but even also in the Commercial space. So I see a pretty steady recovery here. I don't see a snap. As I've said, I've always felt that 2017 would be a good year of building that foundation and see a improvement. I see a much stronger 2018 than I see 2017. But I see right now, based on what I'm seeing from the customer base, based on what I'm hearing from some of our customers and what they're saying they're going to spend on capital next year, overall, I think the pressure is upward, as I say. So I see a pretty steady improvement for the trend line. I do not see a strong snap, but I do see pretty good momentum going into 2018 as I look at it right now. Clearly, what goes on in Washington can have a big impact and a major shift in the sentiment around tax policies or trade policies. Those things all could have a big impact. But right now, I think momentum is going the right way, and we're seeing that. And I don't see it slowing down at this point in time. But I do not see a snap, as you said. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Dave, that's helpful. And then you mentioned you're seeing an increase in MRO activity within Automation Solutions. Maybe you could give us just a little more perspective on what kind of activity in MRO. Is it across the board, including oil and gas? Did oil and gas pick up more or less than the rest of the end markets? And then, have you seen any indication that larger oil and gas projects are starting to at least get dusted off and you're having conversations on those yet? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay, two things going on. I think we've started seeing the MRO, when I went out and talk \u2013 and the shareholders I think in November and December, we started seeing this pick back up. The oil and gas companies, some of our key oil and gas companies, some of our chemical companies, some of our pharmaceutical companies started increasing their spending. They had kept it really, really tight, and I think as they saw, okay, there's going to be better, favorable policies to spend, encourage it, and to really encourage people to spend money, they started spending. It's a slow, okay, here's a little bit more money; you can go ahead and spend it. And I've seen the budgets being set the same way. So we're seeing a slow recovery in MRO around the world and pretty much across all segments, except for a couple of things like marine and segments like that. But it's pretty broad-based. And on projects, what we're going to see first and what we're hearing discussed right now with customers are, first, the phase of, okay, let's make some investments on the quick turnaround, the quick hitters, the productivity ones, some of the safety ones, some of the areas that maybe we curtailed spending for a while, those are going to come back first. Those are what we call in our business KOB3 quick cycle businesses. And then KOB2 is where they're going to look at brownfield typically expansion where maybe they cut the budget in half and only did half the project, or they've already had an expansion, but now they're going to look to that. And that's the discussion we're seeing right now. I personally don't believe we'll see the big projects because our customer base probably got burned a little bit the last time in this for at least 18 to 24 months. They have their hands full, in my opinion, on executing what's still left out there. They're working on the MRO, which is starting to happen, and they're going to work on the what I call the small, minor expansions to get a little bit of capacity here and there in what we refer to as KOB2. So a good mix for us, and that's what we're seeing in our funnel at this point in time. And that's the type of orders we're seeing at this point in time. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, David. That's helpful. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Andrew, you take care. Hopefully I'm a better forecaster this year than I was last year. Next? Operator : Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Hey. Good afternoon, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Gautam. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Hey. Great stuff. Hey. I wanted to \u2013 you've never been shy about making a call, and when... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Me? I'm a very shy person. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Right. In which quarter do you anticipate you'll see firm-wide organic growth turn positive? Is it as early as Q3? Or do you think it's more of like a Q4, Q1 of next year for that? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Based on the trend lines right now, Gautam, I'd say Q3. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Great. Okay. And you may have hesitated to say this, but I thought what you were about to say was that there is some pent-up demand in the MRO space, is that fair? And if so, how does that actually convert? Are we going to start to see a month or two here with much stronger orders and perhaps conversion at some point in the next couple of quarters? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I would hesitate to say, because I don't think any customer in our space would ever say they didn't spend on safety or key programs relative to the environment. But my opinion there from our perspective, I don't \u2013 there is a pent-up investment going into core facilities today around the productivity, around maybe efficiency and the facilities running better. So I think there will be. I don't see a surge. I don't see what I would say a strong, I think as Andrew asked me in the first question, I see a steady okay, here's your capital budget this year and this is where I want to spend the money up front and I want you to start spending the money right off the bat and that's what we've been seeing. So I think what we're going to see is this okay, we haven't spent as much money on keeping the facilities productive, safe, efficient, environmentally friendly, all those different things that you normally see with our industry, I think that's where they're going to go first. And I don't think it's going to be a surge. I think they're going to say here, you have this much money to spend but they're going to let them spend it rather than last year at this time they were starting to pull it back. So that's what I see right now, Gautam. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And one last one just on M&A, obviously you have a target to add maybe $1 billion to $2 billion of sales over the next couple of years, what are you seeing in the pipeline? And relatedly, would you ever consider splitting the company? Getting rid of C&RS and just isolating around the Automation business? Thanks. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: The answer to the second question is no. We're going to talk about \u2013 I think there's a lot of logic to having the two pieces together. They're unique and there's a lot of sharing of technologies. From my standpoint, I've gone through major reposition this company. I've torn the company apart with the management team here and I feel very comfortable we have the right two pieces. They help each other from a standpoint of cash flow and earnings and technology sharing, things we can do back and forth. So there's a lot of good things there in my opinion. So, under my tenureship, maybe I'll get voted out and off the ship and somebody else will look at this but under my tenureship as CEO, we will stay within these two pieces at this point in time. On acquisitions, there are opportunities out there. Our focus right now is totally on getting FTC approval on our Pentair Valves & Control business. I would expect us to continue to do smaller type of transactions this year. And we're clearly looking, hopefully, to get somewhere between $500 million to $1 billion of additional transactions this year. Maybe not totally close but get them locked. So those are being worked right now. So we are actually working transactions and we just want to make sure right now our focus is get FTC approval so we can close Pentair Valves & Control. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Congrats on the heavy lifting. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: So with that, on to next question. Thank you, Gautam. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: My first question would be around the incremental margins that you would expect to see in Automation Solutions. Classically, they have been very strong in prior recoveries. Should we assume the same this time? And maybe related to that, price of material, you've had tailwinds, really, since 2011. Do you think you'll still have a tailwind in Automation over the next 12 months? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: So let's talk about incremental margins. From our perspective, we've been forecasting all year long that we'll have up margins at the Automation Solutions business. So we would expect that the incremental margin on this business will be pretty good. We will clearly keep driving trying to get the profitability back up \u2013 clearly we're going to over the next couple years, get it back up to that 20% level. This is excluding the Pentair Valves & Control but getting it back up to the level we were at 20% plus. But right now we're going to have pretty good \u2013 I would say, good leverage points like we have had historically in the past. It really is a function of how fast North America comes engaged. North America is getting engaged from a order sales standpoint because that's a better mix for us but I would expect us to have good incremental margin at Automation Solutions as we come out of this cycle and well into 2018. The game plan, as you'll see, is we want to get back to historical margins in this \u2013 well within this five-year planning period, excluding the Pentair Valves & Control which will obviously dilute it somewhat start working on that. But that's the game plan and so that's where we are right now. Relative to price cost. As I've been talking for the last two quarters, we've seen the shift. So our net material inflation is less negative, i.e., we're not getting as much commodity benefits from the cost benefits from materials as there's been a slight inflating in the economy which is a good thing in reality. And from a pricing standpoint, we are still, probably, as we usually were six months behind. So as we said, the last four or five years, we've been green. Our price costs have been both slightly negative, from a negative price, negative net material inflation and we're green and they're offsetting it. This year I think we're going to be plus or minus $25 million on the price cost. It could be $25 million green. It could be $25 million red. That's we're in the transition period right now. We see it happening. And so that's the game plan you're going to see relative to all of us try and figure out how to get the net material inflation down. How to start getting some incremental pricing. But if you've been in a period for a while that pricing has been some pressure on the downside, now reversing that trend takes a little longer. But price/cost will be one of those issues this year that we'll be managing heavily. I'll be talking about it next week because you're exactly right. We've had a good run here and now it's shifting. But it's good. I like inflation a little bit from this perspective because we've had negative inflation for a while. So the commodity standpoint will help us from our end market standpoint, too. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. And then my follow-up question would just be on China. Your sales were down, I think 8% in the September quarter; up 17% in December. Clearly, the boost you had in Commercial & Resi looks extreme. But what's your overall sense of the demand picture for the rest of this fiscal year in China? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think if you go back and look at all the transcripts, I've always felt that we'd be somewhere around the 5% range for the total year. Right now with the start, it may be 5% to 6% or 5% to 7%. So the recovery started last \u2013 it actually started in the fourth quarter for us. We had a positive fourth quarter in China and we had a very strong quarter. And we had a good order pace from our Automation business too, so that's starting to recover. So I think that we're going to be somewhere in that 5%, 6%, 7% growth for China this year after some very difficult years. But our position from a cost standpoint and our position from a competitive standpoint in the markets that are starting to invest, we're in a good position right now. So I think China will be a good run here for several quarters, and so I'm looking at 5%, 6%, 7% for the year in underlying growth for China. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome, Julian. See you next week, I hope. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. And... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Joe. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Dave, congratulations on getting a term... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much. I actually read your report this morning. I sent it around where I said I saw Joe said something nice about me. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Well, it was deserved after the quarter. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, I actually do read this stuff to see if it \u2013 the truth of the lending stuff practice here, things like that. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So my first question, I think maybe just following up on Julian's question on China and specifically on your comments on HVAC efficiency regulations. We saw a couple other companies report really strong HVAC growth out of China this quarter. And so I'm just curious, do you guys expect this to be a tailwind for the rest of the year? Or does that start to subside? Maybe a little more color there would be helpful. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, Joe, it's what's in the past, what I've seen is you probably get three or four good quarters of that. So we started seeing some of that in the fourth quarter of last year and again this year. So historically, what I've seen is they run a little too heavy. They get too excited and they overbuild. But I would say this is going to run at least three or four quarters, so I would say well into our third quarter. The good part of this, though, is we're seeing a broad base across Asia-Pacific for us. So China's \u2013 yes, we had a very good two quarters here. But we're starting to see the rest of our Commercial & Residential business growing across all of Asia-Pacific. So that hopefully will come in to kick into play and help us pick up if China slows down. But right now, it looks pretty good for the whole year but my gut always tells me. I'm watching these guys for around three or four quarters, they overbuild and they scale back down. But the efficiency thing's changing. The environment stuff's changing, so we'll see. But that's what I feel right now. But I'm really encouraged by the fact that all of Asia-Pacific is really starting to invest in some of, I would say, the retail stuff and also, the food chain stuff and some of the refrigeration stuff, which is all good business for us. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Got it. And then maybe as my follow-up here, I want to just touch on cash flow for a second. Your operating cash flow this year is expected to be flat versus last year. I guess, as I start to think out to 2018, now that you're seeing it turn, would you expect your cash flow to outpace earnings growth? Or do you think you're going to have to build inventories and maybe have like a working capital drag. Like what would your expectation be post the turn? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Historically, your statement is a true statement. We would have two or three quarters where our cash flow would fall behind a little bit from earnings. The one thing that might happen that we could do depending how fast we get our hands around Pentair, the Valves & Control piece, as I've talked about, they have close to 50% trade working capital. So they have a lot of things we want to get our hands on, but that may take me maybe into the cycle. So if we get engaged in the end of March, early April and I have a chance to work on this for two or three or four quarters, then I think then we could have cash flow actually out-run earnings because of what we have opportunities there. But historically, if 2018 takes off like I think 2018 could take off, then we would do exactly what we said : my working capital would build up a little bit; my receivables will go up a little bit. We run a very good shop here from working capital, but the benefit I'm going to have is we will very much go after the Pentair Valves & Control acquisition working capital and hopefully we can get some of that off to make up for what we go in. And maybe we'll get cash flow to grow a little faster than earnings. But you're exactly right what you said. Two or three quarters most likely that will happen. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks, guys. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Take care, Joe. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: David, good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Hey, John. Good afternoon, John. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: How are you? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Oh, not too bad. How about yourself? John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Oh, I can't complain; can't complain. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're above ground. That's good. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, exactly. Hey, Dave, you called out in the K exports of $888 million. Are you a net exporter or importer in terms of the U.S.? Is there any way you could quantify your import position? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We're basically right now \u2013 the best analysis right now we're working this issue and we're about neutral both in and ex, today. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I mean, you're a huge company in Mexico, which has served you very well. I mean, given kind of what's going on, how would you like us to think about your Mexican operations? And perhaps if required, how readily some of that stuff could be repurposed back to the U.S. or elsewhere, is that even part of your thinking right now? Or you're just going to wait and see? Or just any kind of commentary would be helpful. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, well, it's for me to know and you not to know, but that's okay. But what I'd tell you this is that we're studying a lot. We're looking at the trade flows. We have a very strong presence. As you know, we have a very global regional manufacturing strategy, which we'll talk about next week. So from our perspective, right now we're looking at the trade flows and we're looking at the different analyses, what would happen relative to the approaches coming out of Washington relative to tax policies or to tariff policies or whatever. And there are some products that we can move within 6 to 12 months. Some will take longer if we need to be. Hopefully there'll be some rational thought process out of Washington around this issue. But we are studying it really hard, and as you well know, we know how to execute around that. We did the same thing in Asia many years ago with China as we redirected where our China for China manufacturing. So at this point in time, we're looking at where we have imbalances, we're looking at the timing of what we would have to do if we had to make a change, or if it's just a minor change because of the cost structure. So we're getting ready in dealing and getting our inputs. But as you look at it right now is that, what you have to understand is Emerson will be ready. Emerson will make the adjustments as necessary and will stay competitive in this situation to make sure that we do not be penalized from a cost and a competitive standpoint. But we're going to be very fluid and we're getting ready. Let's put it that way. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's absolutely fair. Can I ask you? You guys have done lot of advanced restructuring over the past couple of years. You've called out the profit margin benefit rise associated with the restructuring of Automated Solutions. As business comes back, and it's not so much an Emerson question, but I'd be interested in your thoughts, how much do you think you have to layer back some of these costs because companies, including perhaps Emerson, were aggressively keeping a very tight fist around, say, lack of compensation and other sort of discretionary costs? It's really a question of sort of \u2013 it's almost really kind of a margin question, right? Like how much cost has to kind of get let back into the business, assuming we go back to sort of normative levels, however you describe that based on your experience of sort of keeping costs under wraps? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, John, I think that from our perspective, we see no indication that we can't set record levels of profitability in these two businesses as we come out of the cycle and get into a normal cycle. The Commercial & Residential Solutions were running at high levels. They're working at, on the platform levels, how they can get additional cost out and do the right integration that gives them the flexibility to both have margin improvement and incremental investments. On the Automation side, historically, we've been able to, even in a recovery time period, we can get back to the historical levels. There's a level of profitability that we find that we start to under-invest in the company, but there's nothing in our cost structure that says that we cut corners to not invest in or spend money on that we're going to have to rush right back in. So I think cost will go back in when we believe that the growth is happening, and will continue to march up as we get our profitability back in the Automation Solutions business, because it did get hit quite hard from the low-20s all the way down into the 16% range. So we're looking to get that back up there. And I don't think there's anything extraordinary here. We'll get better leverage in the first part and then it will slow down as we start putting some costs back in. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Like in other words, you just don't have to go out and hire a bunch of people though as the business comes back. Is that a...? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. No. No. We'll bring people on in certain marketplaces if we're going to expand our technology. It'll be a very systematic approach as we look at the growth in the business and the leverage of the business and we'll start making sure we make the right investments at the right time. But we always plan ahead. We know where we took them out and we'll start thinking about where we want to put them in differently because there's always a chance to put them in differently and that's what we're looking at right now. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks very much. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome, John. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC. Please go ahead. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. I'd like to circle back on Valves & Controls, if we could. And Dave, kind of give us a sense of how ready the organization is for the integration process? You talked about interest and focusing on working capital but what preparation? Are you still thinking a few cents of dilution in the first year? And any updates there would be helpful. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good. We'll give you a lot more updates in the numbers what we see for the 2017 and 2018 for Valves & Control next week but it really hasn't changed much. There'll probably be a little less restructuring. Probably around only $25 million the first year. That means more in the second year. It'd still be slightly dilutive on a earnings per share standpoint. Cash flow accretion still there. Relative to getting ready is I want to thank Randy Hogan and his team and Ed Monser, within the right scope of the government rules, we've been working on this for the last two months, or two quarters not two months. Two quarters and so the integration team is ready. The organization is its structure is known. We've already set that and we let the people know what they're going to be doing from day one. So our plans have been refined and ready to go and as soon as we get approval and we get close we'll be running. We plan to run on the block here because we've used every extra day and every extra week and every extra month here to get further and further down the playing route and Randy Hogan and his team has allowed us to work \u2013 his guys to work with us and that's been very appreciative. That way we get a much faster running start and get them integrated in. Which is a benefit for them too because they get integrated into a very large global automation solutions company, too. Which helps them but we're ready and we're just waiting to get FTC approval and we've got everywhere else done and now we've just got to get those arduous government approvals and we're going. Period. Running. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Just related to that, how are you feeling about the prospects for revenue synergies? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Very good. I think that revenue synergies will take a couple years. We've always said that but not only just from the management of the businesses but we've also been working on the integration of sales channels on a global basis. So we know how we're going to manage that by world area and the key customers accounts and where we mean to make investments and where, maybe, we need to beef up things. So I would say that maybe we've shaved off six months on getting to the sale synergies because we've had more time here but our focus really is, the first couple of years, to get the cost integration done and some of the sale synergies will start happening probably as we get into early 2018. And so I think we're ready both on the cost integration side and the sales side and the leadership side of ready to go because we've been managing it and setting it and my compensation committee has allowed me to get things approved, even though we don't own it, so we're ready to go. And that's what we've been doing. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. See you next week. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski of Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Josh. She did a good job on your name, there. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Yeah, pretty close, right? We had a few extra consonants in there but I'm used to it. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's closer than I could get, Josh. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Fair enough. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Dave, just on seasonality and kind of, the cadence on Automation Solutions from here. I think the normal cadence would suggest that we grow sales and margins kind of sequentially as we move through the year given that this is an inflection point, at least feels like it. It seems like that should be the case maybe even more so. Anything that we should be aware of or anything you want to flag that would fly in the face of that? Especially with a good margin to start out? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: To be honest, I don't think that there's any change in the seasonality and the pace is. I can't remember the first question I had on this. I don't see this being a surge. I see this being a steady mountain climbing here as we're seeing our customer base actually incrementally increasing the spend. And so I think that what we're seeing right now is a pretty marginal, I mean, the typical seasonal pattern here. The one issue will be is I'm sure you've heard a lot of the companies in our space that serve this industry saw slower amount of what I would say service and \u2013 take off the business down \u2013 I'm trying to think of what the name of that word is \u2013 when you take the plants down. Huh? Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Decommissioning or idling? Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Shutdown and changeover. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Changeover, shutdown. I think you're going to \u2013 we didn't see as much the last 18 months of that, and it's usually in the fall. So we might see more of that where some of these facilities that really weren't shut down that much last year and rehabbed and upgraded. I think we might see more of that in the fall this year, which will mean probably a stronger first quarter going into the next fiscal year. Because a lot of facilities really cut back the turnarounds. I'm thinking turnarounds. I think we had less turnarounds \u2013 the lowest number of turnarounds I've seen in a long, long time. And so I think that'd be the only change to your point, Josh. I think we'll be steady as we go on seasonality. We could see a bigger turnaround in our fourth quarter and then the first fiscal quarter of next year. That will be the only thing I see changing right now based on my knowledge base, which... Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Right. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: ...as you know, is limited in this market. I don't know that much. So... Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Yeah, fair enough. And just to follow up on a couple of the questions on China. I think a few of your competitors or I guess adjacent peers called out maybe a budget flush or some bigger project activity both in China and in the U.S., to some extent. Anything that you saw that suggested it felt more like a flush than a normal expansion off the bottom? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I don't agree with that statement. And I think this is a normal where they've held back from an efficiency standpoint or a capital standpoint. And I think these are the things they need to do from an environmental expansion and stuff like that. I do not have that flush. And again, I'm talking about our businesses, Josh. Maybe some of these guys have other different businesses, but our orders in Automation, our orders in Commercial & Residential do not say flush. They say this is a long-term project investments they're doing and these are planned. And it's not a flush. So that's my read on it. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got you. Talk to you next week. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Don't know China all that well, so... Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Afternoon, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: What a difference three months makes, huh? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. And it's \u2013 like I said, I'm never as dumb as I thought I was and I'm never as smart as I thought I am too so here we are, huh? Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just want to go back to the MRO pickup in ICM process, mainly. Are we seeing anything so interesting in terms of instrumentation versus valve versus maybe controls? Obviously, there's different margin structures there. And given that MRO will almost exclusively go through a distribution channels, any comments on sell-ins or sell-out from distribution? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think that what we've seen so far \u2013 obviously in the early cycle of a MRO recovery, you're going to get more instrumentation, more flow, which we typically would see and that's what's happening. You do see get \u2013 you do get some valve upgrades and replacements, but you typically will see the early cycle, which we're starting to see is the instrumentation and the flow side. That's the first places that gets the biggest bang for their buck on the quick investment. So that's what we're seeing right now, and I would expect that to continue. Even though the valves business has been good, I would still say that underlying decline is still in line where I would expect it to be. We're really seeing the instrumentation side and the flow side come back up on the MRO. And so I think that's going to be normal, and I don't see that changing in \u2013 for the cycle here at all. And so the turnaround for the valves will be more relevant when I get out into the late 2017, going into early 2018 and that's where the valves would see a little bit more MRO, from my perspective. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then you've mentioned that Randy's been very generous with the vetting process with Valves & Controls. Any kind of changes even at the fringes in terms of how you're thinking about the synergies? You mentioned obviously, revenue synergies a little bit further up. In terms of cost synergies, EPS accretion, anything like that? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No changes right now. I think that we still \u2013 we have reconfirmed. We probably \u2013 as we've spent more time together, we probably have seen some of the expansion of the plants, the integration of plants and some of the organizations that we've tweaked it here and there. But nothing changed from our initial strategy, what we see at this point in time. So yeah, we've been reconfirming. The key thing for us with extra time is really to get the organization structure and to get the names in the boxes of the right leadership, Randy, which has been extraordinary. He's allowed me to talk to his people relative to opportunities and things like that, which is important so we can hit the ground running. And when we do get closure from the final approval from the government, we can tell everybody this is your job and they already know it and they can go from day one, which means a lot in a structure like this on a global company. This is a very global company. So that's why I really want to commend Randy for letting me do that. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just one more, Dave, from me. Automation orders turned positive in December, organic orders in the month of December. Is the backlog now up year-over-year for Automation? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I don't know the number off the top of my head. Frank? We'll have to look. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: So EBIT is. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I would say it would have to be up a tad. Yeah. I know it is. I heard Mike say today to the board. Yeah. We've built a little backlog. Yes. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: (sic) Nigel, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Please go ahead. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good afternoon, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Mr. Stifel Robby. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Let's see. I guess the first question on the cost side. I mean, obviously, there was some commentary that suggested that some cost needed to come back, but in the context of the overall structure of this company, you've taken a lot of cost out, structural cost, right, over the last couple of years. So maybe you could talk about kind of where margins could be at A&S, maybe excluding Pentair and then Commercial & Resi? I mean, what do you think are kind of the signposts going out the next couple of years? Where do you think margins structurally could get to? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We're going to show that to you next week. I mean, I think structurally we're looking at Commercial & Residential through the work that Bob's doing, both with investments, and then also, Jim Lindemann working on his organization. I think we're going to get to a \u2013 that margin's going to run around 24%, 25%. That's where it's going to run. And if the pace of business goes well and the mix right, it should easily get to 25%. On the Automation Solutions business, our goal is to get that back up into that 20%, 21%, where it was before. That's a sweet spot from us from the standpoint of our mix and what we can try to do with that. Maybe even get to 22%. This is about Pentair, based on what, if the U.S. stays well and strong in the oil and gas area. But structurally, we take a lot of cost out, (46:14) so we can take that, those businesses back up to that level in this planning cycle. So I feel pretty good about that from that standpoint, and so we're going to make pretty good money on the margins of this business as we get back up there, and we'll be setting record levels of profit margins as a total company based on what we've done to the cost structure for this repositioning effort. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So to be clear, you've taken structural cost out? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Correct. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, well, no. Dave, sometimes, questions can be a statements on drag. Anyway, moving on. With respect to Trump, maybe you could talk about kind of in the broad scheme of things, obviously, a lot of red meat in terms of de-reg and tax benefits, but then you have border adjustability and you have some concern over trade. So it's a bit of a mixed bag here and obviously, we don't see what's going to happen with every one of these policies, but how do you manage the company through this? And what are you scrutinizing in terms of the agenda going forward as kind of key signposts for you to how to better manage the company? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Going back to \u2013 so I can't remember who asked this question to me about Mexico. I don't know if it was John Inch or someone like that. But the question for me is, right now, we're getting ready for any changes to the NAFTA agreement. We have to understand where we are today and because we've been running our NAFTA for 25 years. And so we're looking at the flows and things like that what our position is today, how much rigidity to timing if it moves up. So we're looking \u2013 that is a very important work going on at the company right now because based on what comes out of Washington tells me that, okay, either we're going to have to slow our expansion or reverse and bring some stuff back north of the border. So we're going to have to look at all those different things as based on what comes out of Washington. And generally, right now, the people are looking at more investments in the U.S. versus less investments, so are hedging their bet. Because people are investing right now, so spending's happening. The other issue, as you well know, they're looking at giving you 100% first year, I guess, amortization and depreciation, which also will have a big positive impact on spending and productivity. So my main focus right now are, okay, which way do you think they're going to go relative to the tax rate, which way they're going to go relative to any type of taxing on imports/exports? Is there going to be a slap on duties just because he's getting impatient? But right now, I'm looking at all these different things, and we're getting our options prepared so we can start moving. As you well know, we're really, really good at managing once we know the playing field relative to our manufacturing structure and where we're going to move things. And we're getting ready and we're creating options, as I've told the board, and we're prioritizing based on the competitive situations which, if I don't do it fast, I'll be at a competitive disadvantage. If I don't have a competitive issue, I don't need to do it as fast. So we're getting ready. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: The last question is just on January order trends. Anything you'd call out positive or negative in terms of complexion there in terms of what you're seeing? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: The good thing that I saw as I traveled the United States in the second half of the calendar year 2016 is I knew, I could sense that there was going to be a pick-up in spending in the last couple of months because I could see the price of oil firming, I could see the budgets hadn't been spent, just based on what I felt out there. That has flowed through again on the same curve as we saw in December. So that tells me our customers are allocating capital at least equal to or slightly higher to the capital that they went out the year with. So that's a good sign for me. So that's the one thing I saw, and I want to see again in February, does that continue? Because that tells me the capital is being allocated and freed up for people to spend, and that's a key sign to me relative to my Automation side. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. I'll see you next week. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: See you next week. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Please go ahead. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Afternoon, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, some of these areas that have already been good, you know, power, chemical, life sciences, are there any projects that complete there that cause any moderation there? Or do these also kind of cyclically pick-up with all this increased MRO spending, et cetera? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I don't see any slowdown in those businesses. I think that the pharma side of the business marketplace should be good for the rest of this year, probably early into 2018. It runs in cycles, but it looks pretty good right now with a lot of new drugs, a lot of repositioning and things going on. So I think it looks good and some of the new regulations. I think that looks good, pharmaceutical, for well into 2018. We had a big surge, and I think it will just be a steady improvement now. Relative to the power side, I think you're still seeing people upgrading their facilities. I do not see power being back down. They're still taking old coal power plants off, putting gas power plants in. We have some nuclear investments around the world. So the power looks to me like I would say through 2018, it looks pretty good to us at this point in time. On chemical, I think that a lot of that has to do with \u2013 I'm looking at what our customer base is going to be allocating relative to capital and relative to where they want to locate some of their new capacity. There's been a push to get into North America. If that continues with the low price of gas that's a good sign for us, and so we should still see a pretty good chemical spending. But right now, those three markets are, I think will trend well for us, with power probably being one of the better ones for us for at least the next 18 months. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then on Commercial & Resi Solutions, in addition to all the restructuring savings benefit, you called out the benefit platform leverage. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Correct. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Can you just fill that out a little bit more and how big is that of a benefit versus the old structure? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Well, it's really what we're changing \u2013 someone keeps asking the question how much is this, you just take out like cost, sales and sales people, engineering people? The platform structure is actually as a permanent structure as we change the way we do business where we're starting to integrate procurement, you're integrating some of the manufacturing, integrating engineering. You're actually taking some what I'd call real structural changes so it really lowers the cost, so what we've been able to do through this integration platform, you look at the margins of this business since we announced the Commercial & Residential Solutions business integration on our bar chart (52:49) you see a steady improvement in the profitability of this business. We had a very good improvement last year in the second half. We saw a pretty good first quarter here. So those are things that we see happening that will stay there and that also allows Bob to have money to invest incrementally. So Bob has been already starting to invest in some of the key areas relative to the food safety, some of the transportation stuff. And so I think that the reason I said the platform, this one in particular gives us a chance to reinvest in the business and pass some higher margin (53:17) on which I think you have been seeing for the last couple quarters in our Commercial & Residential business and should see for the rest of this year. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks a lot. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Dave. Is it time to bring out your Rally Monkey in the off-season in baseball? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yuck. Now, am I supposed to call you Christopher or you want me to call you Chris? Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Call me a happy Patriots fan. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Oh, good. That was a great game. That was a good game. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: It was. Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.: It was a good game . David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: The Rally Monkey is definitely out, Chris. I've got the Rally Monkey. Rally Monkey sleeps on my bed at night. It sits right there. It's ready to go at all times. You never know at my age you need a Rally, you know? Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yeah, yeah, not quite time to go out (54:13) . Hey, it's interesting to see the Automation Solutions profitability improvement really leading the end market underlying recovery there. Was that just all sustainable structural improvement or was there some favorable mix in the quarter? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We had some favorable mix. The business did do better, Chris. I'll be very honest. The business did better. They were on a good path. I think one of the guys asked earlier about this. They're on a good path. They're on a curve that you normally see a recovery. The cost reductions really have taken hold so we've got a bigger bump relative to the uplift in the profitability. They had a good mix. Obviously with the shift coming towards instrumentation, some of the flow, some of the (54:56), that does help us. Secondly, we also saw some currency help in the quarter, which we could have for a couple of quarters and we have to take some of that back. But overall, I want to tell that team has done a phenomenal job taking costs out through the last 18 months. And so when they start seeing some what I would say uplift in the trend lines, you're starting to see that improved profitability. But some things did go further away for the first quarter and hopefully that will continue in the second quarter. But overall, profitability was very good in that business. They did get benefit from mix, they did get benefit from a little bit of currency. But hats off to those guys. You're talking about how far down they are from where they were and then running those levels of profitability is darn good. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And on the corporate spend, what are we expecting for this year? And then, is this year consistent with longer term now that you're settling into a much different overall enterprise structure? Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.: So, Chris, it'll be still probably a little less than $500 million because we beat the first quarter, but I would say longer term that's still pretty much in great... Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, I think from a run rate standpoint that's about right. We continue to work on the corporate spend and it's come down dramatically over the last couple of years, but I think that's \u2013 there are some items in there that move around like incentive comp, but I think that's probably right for a run rate for this year. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, yeah, I don't see. We're almost done with the corporate restructuring and the downsizing based on a smaller company. We're also still tweaking a little bit about what is done at the two-platform levels, what's done in corporate. There's always that discussion. We brought Mike and Bob onto the OCs so they can participate in this, but there's a level of governance as you well know that I and Frank are responsible to the board. And so I think we're getting to the point that I feel comfortable with and then, when we bring Pentair on and we have to figure out how to get them incorporated onto some of our controls and stuff like that, we're going to have to add a few there. But right now I think we've got it where we want it. And again, that's a lot of hard work to do what these guys did, to take that structure out like we did. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Good color. And then just, seeing anything on the strong dollar from a global competitive dynamic? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. No. I don't think the global competitive dynamic's changed much right now. The euro's been bouncing pretty tight between $1.06 and $1.08. If it goes to $1.10 it'll be a real nice wind at my back. We've got our European structure right now pretty good, because we went through this process where the euro really weakened. So right now the dynamic world is pretty set and we haven't had a lot of changes. It's been more of a, I would say, what's coming out of the political arena more than anything else is creating some changes. But we'll see what happens here. Right, we're all \u2013 I'm watching very clearly what the Washington folks decide to do relative to trade, what they do to tax. Because we are in a situation in pretty good from the standpoint of a cost structure and so we're going to have to adjust and figure out where we go from there. We're about as competitive we've been in a long, long time at running at where we are right now. Frank just told me on the backlog, we're slightly down year-over-year \u2013 up sequentially which is what these guys look at. We're up sequentially, but down year-over-year. So from fourth to first we're up, but first to first we're down which makes sense. So the trend is going up. Somebody asked that question. Anything else, Chris? Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: No. Chris or Christopher's fine. Just don't call me Oppenheimer Chrissy. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Oh, I like that one. I'm always looking for nicknames. Chris, you take care. look forward to seeing you next week, okay? Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. I'll be in India. Bye. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, thanks for fitting me in. Appreciate it. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I just gave them authority to two more after you. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Well, I'm in Germany so I appreciate it. I stayed up for you, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: (59:02) I stayed up. In fact, I was going to bed and my son called me, said, dad, you need to turn the TV back on and I said, what? Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: You've got to watch Tom and Bill and see how it's done. Listen, I wanted to ask you, just circle back to restructuring, just a quick point. You mentioned the Pentair restructuring Valves & Controls might be $25 million instead of the \u2013 I think it was $50 million to $70 million that you quoted originally or talked about originally. You also talked about like $50 million in the core business and it was the current pro forma business. Do you still see that still playing out? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. I'll show a chart in charge next week. I'll give you quarter by quarter. It looks to me like about $50 million for our core business plus or minus that number. I can't call within $10 million and it looks to me right now around $25 million for Pentair. Again, I'll show you quarter by quarter, I'd show you how we think it's going to unfold here and what our saving's going to be. Given the fact that we're going to be as I say next week late in the cycle of getting Pentair on board, we probably won't get much of savings help for the first but we're getting some of the restructuring done that will help us early on in 2018. So that's what we see right now and we'll give you sizing relative to what we see from the other charges we have to do from a inventory standpoint, the valuation of inventory, the valuation of backlog. We have some estimates right now, but we're still working on that but we're ready to go. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Look forward to that. Also, I was at Asbury (01:00:27) last week, spent a lot of time in the Emerson booth. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: (01:00:34) Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I didn't even have to wear my fake mustache. It was all good and it was the busiest show I think in 14 years Dave which is either a quite good thing or a bit of a concern around peak. As you sort of look at that and by the way some of the growth in VRF for example, most of the OEMs were talking about 15% to 20% growth in VRF, also. How do you see that sustainability and by the way how are you guys currently seeing your positioning on the VRF side? Are you taking advantage of that? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We're definitely taking advantage and I'm going to have Bob talk about that next week for you guys. You know there's a lot going on around the technology area right now relative to the efficiencies, relative to the refrigerants, relative to some people not investing for some time, the energy stuff. I think there's a lot that's why the show was so strong. I think people, for a change, are going to have some money to spend and I think these guys are looking at where they can spend so that's why I think there was so much energy around that. And if you think about North America refrigeration, these guys are going through some of the biggest transformations they're going to have to ever do in efficiency and so I think especially in refrigerants, these guys are all gearing up and that's why people are so energized. And so I think we could have a good run here in North America through 2017 and 2018, which will be a good thing to have which we've been waiting for as you know. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes. Okay, great. I look forward to seeing how it all fits together next week. See you then. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Well, we try. I mean, don't get too excited. We might not do a very good job, you know. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Dave, you always do a good job. It'll be fun. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: And don't bring your camera. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: That's not me. Hey, Dave, that's a different guy. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. Next. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Hello, Rich. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, good afternoon. How are you? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Not too bad. You're the next to the last one. You got under the net. You're sort of like got your nose under the finishing line there. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I appreciate it. Quick one on C&RS. In terms of rigid tools, that piece of the business has got a fair amount of energy exposure. What are you seeing in terms of demand trends there? And how do you think some of the stabilization of oil and energy is going to help out on the Commercial & Residential Solutions side as we think about the rest of the year? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Rich, the question \u2013 and I've forgotten \u2013 somebody asked me a question about distribution earlier and I forgot to answer it, my fault but that question is one of the early signs, when we know that the incremental spending on MRO, the incremental spending in upgrading the facilities both in oil and gas or any type of facilities, it goes through the channel, the industrial channel which is the rigid. We start seeing that channel pick back up in October. And so what that tells me is that they're seeing activity within their core marketplaces relative to industrial world or oil and gas and the chemical world and they're bringing in the tools and equipment ahead of time and they're starting to spend. So we've seen that channel improve. We've seen our orders improve, our sales improve, so that's a good sign for me. So I want to watch that going back to my earlier comment, for the next couple of months because if they continue to do that, that means it's selling through. And then their customers are actually doing the ongoing MRO, they're actually doing some of the incremental facility rehabbing or upgrading. And so right now, the trend is good and I have a lot of indicators within Emerson and that is one of them and that one is on par where I think it should be relative to the cycle. And given the fact that I run it, I understand that pretty well and that tells me they should do pretty well here for the next couple of quarters. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And how far down is the business relative to peak? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: 20%. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Similar to process? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes, 20%. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Can I bring my Polaroid next week? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, you bring your Polaroid and we'll see where it goes. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : See you next week. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: See you later. It was good talking to you, Rich. Okay, who's last? Who's it? Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Steve Tusa's last. If I know it was Tusa, I would've cut him off. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, well do not... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Steve, how are you doing, Steve? Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I'm doing okay. Thanks for fitting me in. I appreciate it. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: And well, yeah, and I know because you never use cameras. You've never done that to me. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Absolutely not. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I know, you're very good at that because you're an honest person. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I expect now that things have turned the corner that there are going to be less slides omitted, is that what we should expect? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You didn't hear my opening comments, Steve. I talked about, I'm still having the decision. I mean had the guys and gals right across and I have five planners working with me and I have these red dots everywhere and Craig walks in there and starts looking like he's got the measles because he saw, you can't omit all those charts so we're in a strategy right now. This is the way I think. I'm thinking about omitting like 20 charts and then have them stuck somewhere that it feels like a hide and seek type of thing. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Way to blame Craig, that's real leadership. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Well, no, he's not going to get. He's going to get the chart, he's going to have them if I just do it. Now, I don't know I always have some elimination and I think over the years we've been, people have never abused it so we've been more careful about it so I give more out. But probably I'd say less omitted this year than I have in the past, Steve. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: (01:06:24) just fun of it, just admit it, have it rolled it up inside somewhere. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. So just on Pentair, what exactly has been the delay? Has it been kind of election at all related? And would you say that once you've got this kind of clearance from the U.S. that this thing can kind of close in a pretty like expeditious manner that this is basically the last major hurdle that you have to go through? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes, the biggest delay has been, we've had first of all we have a presence in the process world, as you know. We're pretty broad across the various technologies and we've had a presence in the control side. And I think a lot of both from a competitive standpoint, a customer standpoint and the challenge standpoint around the world, I think they all want to understand, okay, what would this be the impact to the industry. The U.S. was far more inquisitive about this than anybody else. They're the last of the basic approvals. Really not been government, the FTC has a lot on their plate. They've been expeditiously working with us on this thing. They've got a lot of mergers and acquisitions are working on, so I don't blame this on the government. I'd just blame it on the fact that they're doing a very thorough review. They're looking at a significant sized acquisition that will change the profile of our business and what that means from our customer standpoint. And I think they're checking the boxes like they should be checking the boxes. It's taken them longer than I thought only because you've got a lot of information that once they start getting into it they have to go through it but we're hoping here later this week that everything's signed off on, where we'd go and what we have to deal with. And that we'll close as quickly as possible as we can in March. And we've got everything ready to go from the standpoint where cash has got to be, what the organization so we're ready to go and hit the ground running and it's a lot of work of the FTC to understand the marketplace which they probably would normally not look at. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. So, Dave, you're generally a guy with a view and I think there's a lot of people out there who have opinions and a lot of guys are not giving their opinions but you're not one to shy away from that. What do you think is the ultimate outcome of the major buckets around tax reform? And in your opinion, when do you think that you get clarity on this? You're obviously creating all these plans and scenarios which you should be doing but what does your gut tell you on how far this is actually going to go from an execution perspective? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think we will get clarity as a nation by late summer, early fall. I think it will take time to get it rolled out and so that means that's why we're getting ready from the standpoint. I believe we will get some kind of tax reform which will include probably some trade renegotiations around that and what that means relative to how we bring products in and out of the country back-and-forth. But I think it'll be tied around tax approaches to come up with a more equal tax policy and structure for the U.S. companies which will be good for us. But I think it's going to take a while for them to get that done because there's a lot of gives and takes and it will obviously include repatriation type of approach on an ongoing basis around the world so we pay it, no matter where we make the money and get the money back. So I'm looking for clarity by late summer, early fall and that gives me time, as I get into execution later this year, early 2018 based on if I have to change anything. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then one last question, just remind us why your tax rate is so high and given you guys are pretty global company, if the U.S. moves to kind of somewhere in the 15% to 20% range how much downside you know \u2013 I would think your tax rate would already be lower than it already is. So I'm just not sure how much more \u2013 how much of a benefit that would actually be for you guys if you just said, hey, today you wake up in the U.S. it's 15% to 20%, where does that bring your consolidated tax rate to? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: The reason we have a high tax rate is because we're very strong and powerful and we manufacture a lot in United States and we sell a lot in the United States, we make a lot of money in the United States, we manufacture a lot in the United States. So we've always paid our taxes on the U.S. tax structure. So our effect tax rate in United States is 37%. So based on if you really had true tax legislation coming through, Steve, where there's some changes, maybe some of the cross-border movements around and some taxes here and there to try to rebalance that, our tax rate should move down into the 20s based on what happens to the final \u2013 how does it come out. But it really makes a difference of what they do with all the different ins and outs relative to the imports, the exports what they do relative to some of the treaties. But we fundamentally pay in the U.S. that type of tax rate. So if they lower the U.S. tax rate down to 20% or 15%, say 20%, we will move down towards that. But I expect that some of the other things will go against us. But overall, our tax rate should come down with true tax reform and tax policy rather than tax edicts, so it should come down. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. All right. Thanks a lot, guys. Good quarter. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you. All the best. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Again, I want to thank everybody for joining me today. I really appreciate it. I want to thank my organization for the great job they did the last three months and look forward to another strong second quarter. Look forward to seeing everybody in New York next week. As always, enjoy it. And look forward to taking Q&A and hear what everyone thinks about. Take care now. Bye. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Emerson's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be opened for questions. This conference is being recorded today, May 2, 2017. Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Craig Rossman, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead, sir. Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you, Denise. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's fiscal 2017 second quarter results. A conference call slide presentation will company my comments and is available on Emerson's website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. I will start with the second quarter summary as shown on page two of the slide presentation. Sales in the second quarter were flat on both a net and underlying basis. The quarter results reflected a continued improvement in our served markets as evidenced by March orders which were up 4% on a consolidated trailing three-month basis. While the Automation Solutions platform remained down, power and life sciences markets remain favorable and trends in oil and glass MRO continue to strengthen. Mid-single-digit growth in the Commercial & Residential Solutions platform benefited from favorable HVAC, refrigeration, and construction-related markets. All profitability measures increased in the second quarter primarily due to savings from restructuring actions taken in 2016. Earnings per share from continuing operations increased 2% to $0.58. On April 28, we officially closed the acquisition of the valves and control business from Pentair. Turning to slide three. Gross profit margin of 43.6% increased 50 basis points driven primarily by cost reductions while EBIT margin was up 30 basis points. Earnings per share included a $0.13 impact related to the discontinued operations of Network Power, Leroy-Somer, and Control Techniques. Turning to slide four. Global demand conditions were similar to the first quarter as growth in the United States, China, and Europe was offset by declines in Canada, Middle East/Africa, and Latin America. Turning to slide five. Total segment margin was up 40 basis points primarily due to benefits from restructuring actions. Accounting methods, corporate and other, and interest expense were all lower than the prior year. Operating cash flow from continuing operations of $601 million was down 5% while trade working capital improved 50 basis points led by improvement in DSO metrics. Turning to slide six. Automation Solutions sales decreased 3% on both a net and underlying basis as spending in process automation remained at low levels but continued to improve. General industrial markets were more favorable resulting in growth in our industrial solutions products. Power and life sciences markets continue their positive momentum and are expected to support growth in the second half of the year. Order rates continue to strengthen during the quarter which was evident in March orders which were up high teens on an underlying basis. MRO spending in energy-related markets continue to improve particularly in North America which was driven by shale and downstream customers. Margin decreased 10 basis points to 15.5% primarily due to deleverage on lower volume and $12 million of higher bad debt expense related to Venezuela. We expect the second half of the fiscal year to improve with underlying sales trends turning positive driven by MRO spending and small project orders. Turning to slide seven. Commercial & Residential Solutions sales increased 5% on both a net and underlying basis reflecting strong demand in global air conditioning and refrigeration markets and favorable conditions in construction-related markets. North America, which was up 4%, was driven by solid growth in residential and commercial air conditioning as well as favorable demand for professional tools by oil and gas customers and do-it-yourself products from big box retailers. Sales growth of 13% in Asia was led by mid-teens growth in China air conditioning and refrigeration markets. Margin improved 80 basis points to 23.7% primarily from leverage on higher volume and savings from prior year restructuring actions. A favorable outlook for global demand within our served markets supports our expectation for the platform to achieve mid-single-digit growth for fiscal 2017. Turning to slide eight. Based upon our first half results and an expectation of continued improvement in second half order trends, we're raising our full year guidance as follows. Net sales are now expected to be approximately flat with underlying sales up approximately 1% excluding unfavorable currency translation. Within the platforms, Automation Solutions net sales are expected to be down 3% to 4% with underlying sales down 2% to 3% excluding unfavorable currency translation of 1%. Commercial & Residential Solutions sales are expected to be up 5% to 6% on both a net and underlying basis. Earnings per share are being raised to $2.55 to $2.65 from our previously guided range of $2.47 to $2.62. This guidance does not include the impact of the recently completed valves and controls acquisition. Our expectation for operating cash flow from continuing operations remains at approximately $2.5 billion. And now, I will turn it over to Mr. David Farr. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. First of all, I want to say that we did have a good recovery in the second quarter, and from the performance level based on what we discussed on the February conference call we did slightly beat what we'd discussed in that call. Orders for the three-month roll were 4.5% positive in the three-month roll for the quarter. Sales were flat, slightly above where we thought they'd be. Our GP, gross profit margin, our operating profit margin, our EBIT margins were all up and, yes, Automation Solutions margins were up underlying but we made the decision to clean up potentially future receivable issues primarily around Venezuela, and we wanted to make sure that we're perfectly clean coming out of this quarter given what's going on down in Venezuela. So we made that choice here in the corporate world to make sure that we had no risk relative to potential receivables in Venezuela. So we made that decision and we did hurt the margin by 50 basis points relative to that. From the EPS standpoint, I said that the EPS would be most likely slightly down or, at best, flat. We did beat slightly our EPS last year. Our free cash flow was stronger and exceeded our earnings by over 100%. So a very good quarter and we have momentum. As we look at the current order pace, and you remember the blue band that we laid out in February in our presentations, from the standpoint of that blue band we're now running above the blue band. It doesn't mean we may not drop back down below the blue band or back in the blue band, and that was a chart that you did get \u2013 you did get that chart so don't accuse me of not giving you that chart, you did get that chart \u2013 we are now running as of this month, the current month, in the 5% to 6% level of underlying orders. So our order pace continues to do better. We're starting to see the mix change between shorter-term cycle orders and some medium cycle orders coming in. So it will mean that obviously we're going to start building some backlog as we go forward here in the coming months. The other thing that you'll see in the third quarter, and I want to talk very openly about the third quarter, we would expect our underlying sales in the third quarter to be up, up 4% to 5%. We'd expect our operating margins, the performance at the operating levels at the operation businesses, up for the quarter. The big issue that we need to discuss so people don't get carried away is from the standpoint of the corporate cost this year, we had an artificially low corporate cost benefit last year by the tune of almost about $30 million from the standpoint of one-time benefits we got last year, from a Byrd Amendment benefit that we got \u2013 it's a dumping duty that we got a sudden payment from pension, from other actions. This year, we're going to be having our corporate costs would be over, I think on the OID level, will be over $100 million. It will be higher so, therefore, we're going to lose a lot of money at the OIOD level primarily from last year's $40 million to over $100 million this year. And it's driven around a couple of areas. It's driven by that we now are booking some of the costs from the acquisition of Pentair Valves and Control. We will not have the benefit of the Byrd Amendment this time. We will have also the incentive comp because, other than today's stock price, the stock price has been doing pretty well, so because of the stock price rise we have a benefit of that. And with the pension accounting rules changed just last year, this year we have over $10 million of incremental makeup versus last year. So from the corporate standpoint, we're going to lose some of the benefit from the operation running much higher. So underlying operations, we'll see sales up, profits up nicely, margins up. And we will, I'm telling you right now, we will be plus or minus flat $0.01 or $0.02, flat from last year's EPS. Our upside and reality based on the order pace we're seeing right now resides in the fourth quarter. We did slightly better than our plan in the first quarter. We did slightly better than our plan in the second quarter. We've always felt that we'd be kind of flat here in the third quarter, and I mean it because underlying sales will be up but the corporate costs are going to offset that. And then the upside we see as we look at the fourth quarter, if underlying sales continue to move nicely and we continue to see that margin expansion we should see a pretty good EPS growth, earnings growth in the fourth quarter, giving that range that we talked about most likely in the $2.55 to $2.65 range, looking most likely around that $2.60 range plus or minus $2.62, $2.59. That's where we're looking at right now with a good fourth quarter. And it's because of what we saw. We had a unique benefit last year in the third quarter around operations. But operations right now are starting to see good underlying growth in the 4% to 5% range. Good, where I'd say operating earnings growing up in the 9% to 10%, 11% range, and we have to get through this one quarter here relative to the corporate issues which we face. So underlying from our perspective right now, the operations are running well and I look for a strong operating quarter and then I look for a really good, strong operating quarter in the fourth quarter and a good close to finish the year. So people may think that the numbers aren't moving as rapidly as they want to but they need to look at behind the curve, and if you see the underlying performance of the company right now it's clearly on a very good path. Our order pattern's very good and we're ahead of what we thought we'd be in February. We're ahead of what we've said in the conference call last time. And I feel very good about where we see right now as we go into the second half of the year, as we go into the last quarter of the calendar year and from that momentum standpoint. So that's where we sit at this point in time. The only last comment I would make around the world, as I look at the world because then someone will ask me, I see right now our North America business has continued to improve and we see good growth coming in North America now. Order pattern in North America has been very good and continues to improve. I continue to see improvement in China and other parts of Asia. Very strong growth in that part based on the product lines and the customer base we have there. I see good momentum continuing in Western Europe. Eastern Europe and Russia has not really recovered much yet. I do not see much recovery at all and I still see negative in Middle East/Africa. I still see concerns in Latin America. I do not see that recovery happening there at that point in time. I'm starting to see some benefit in the early stages of uptake in Canada. So most of the markets that I see right now, driven primarily by U.S., China, Asia, and Canada, and Western Europe. Those are the markets doing well at this point in time. We'll talk a little bit about the valves and controls from the perspective of where we sit at this point in time. We've owned it now for three days. It's very good to get through. We're doing a lot of actions. It's very early to tell what we're going to see at this point in time. As we've said back in February, we were going to have some earnings dilution and, from that standpoint, we still believe there will still be slightly earnings dilution. We only have five months now versus we're planning on a little bit more time at that point in time. We're probably, at that point, we're probably talking about six or seven months so it's still earnings dilution. We will try to give more clarity around this as we start analyzing where they stand relative to sales, the profitability, and so forth. So there's still slightly earnings dilution around the incremental restructuring, some amortization, and that's not different than I've said before. The one-time purchase accounting which we really are going to have to spend a lot of time on, that number is going to be less than we said before. I think we told you the price and the backlog, and we look at the purchase accounting it's going to be around $0.25 to $0.30 per share. It's probably most likely going to be half of that, maybe not quite half of that, but we need four or five months of work on that issue and to get that done and then we'll come back out and give you some clarity around that. From a cash flow standpoint, given it's only five months, we might have a little bit of positive free cash flow. It's really relative around how much restructuring we can get done in the next five months, and we're just starting. So we have less cash and less earnings. So, therefore, restructuring might eat up some of the cash flow in the earnings there but hopefully we'll still have a positive free cash flow for the five months that we own the company. Fundamentally, long-term trend hasn't changed. It's just that we owned it for less. We have less time and we've got to get our arms around it. And as soon as I give you some more clarity or I feel I can give you more clarity around it, I will but it will be slightly dilutive in earnings per share, actual earnings with the incremental restructuring and the amortization. It will have a one-time hit because of the purchase accounting and then we'll set out the numbers as we go forward. But still a very good fundamental deal for us. We're acting on it and hopefully the cash flow will be slightly positive for the year when it's all said and done. But nothing different there except maybe probably another $0.01 or $0.02 dilutive in the year because we have less time demands from a restructuring standpoint and a benefit standpoint. That's where we sit. Very excited about it. If any of the valves and controls people are on the phone, we're looking forward to working with you. It's an exciting acquisition, joining a very strong Automation Solutions business, and we look forward to working with you and with your customer base and our customer base, and really realizing both the growth synergies and some of the opportunity synergies. So really exciting opportunity for us from that perspective. With that, I'll turn it over to the open line and let people ask questions, and feel free to make comments and any questions you want. Operator : Thank you, sir. At this time, we will open the floor for questions and answers. And your first question will come from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good afternoon, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon. Before I'd make a comment, I'll also make a comment that this might be Rossman's last conference call because I'm looking for a position for him in some place out there. So if you guys have any ideas, please call me. But seriously, seriously, he has running his tape and with all the new positions. I'm serious on this. His name's in play right now so he may not be on the phone call ever again. I might be soloing it with Frank Dellaquila here. So that's a real scary thought that Frank and I are going to be doing investor relations with no one to cover for us. I forgot to make that comment. And Craig, I know he's laughing. He doesn't know it yet but his name's in play, and it's a fun situation. So it might be the last time he'll get to talk to me about this, my friend. Okay. First question, go ahead. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Dave, we've got some opportunities for him so stay tuned. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You do? Good. Okay. He found one already. Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.: He found one? Sure. Thanks. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Can you give us a little more color on your Automation Solutions margin? Just to clarify, you don't see any more risk in South America. But even if we exclude that impact, your margin was down sequentially with rising sequential volume. I know you talked about it at the Analyst Day, higher inflation pressure versus price. Did you see that or any other impact...? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No, it's not to do with that. It's nothing to do with that. It's all about \u2013 that's a currency impact from the standpoint \u2013 in the first quarter, we got a benefit. We have long-term contracts with customers that are priced in dollars and projects and even though the business may not have a lot right now, but we still do, and the way the dollar moves and some of the pricing in these transactions, it's all function. We got a benefit and it went against us this quarter. Next quarter, it could be positive. That's why, sequentially, they had a problem. It's nothing to do with operations, not to do with price cost. So it's nothing to do with that. It's from a currency which as this business gets too slow from time to time. So that's all it is. It all works out by end of year typically. Within 12 to 14 months, it all flushes out. That's what the issue is. Operationally, the margins were up... Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.: 17.1%. We're at 18.6%. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. So it's a good margin for the quarter. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Dave, do you think that the margins there can still do 17% to 18%? I think that's what you talked about at the Analyst Day for 2017. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. I think, in fact, if profitability right now \u2013 so we gave right now from the standpoint \u2013 you're talking operating or EBIT margins? So you're talking EBIT margins? Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: EBIT. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. So I think these businesses will beat the number. Yeah, it'll be the fourth quarter I think because there's businesses starting to tick up. They're going to have underlying growth in the third quarter. The margins come in so my fundamental belief right now is that margin will be better than we presented to you in the Analyst Meeting. So right now in the third quarter we're looking at over a point of margin improvement in Automations and probably the fourth quarter we're looking at close to 2.5 to 3 points of margin improvement. Overall, for the year we're looking at over a point. And so we're looking at slightly higher margin than we told you as we go forward here in the rest of this year. So they're starting to come forward. The tension will be for these guys is where they start investing and from my perspective I want to get back above a 17-plus percent EBIT margin as we finish the year in Automation Solutions. So my impression is try to get the midpoint of 17% by the final endpoint of this year for Automation Solutions. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. That's helpful. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: So I would expect us to see continued improvement, sequential improvement, and year-over-year improvement in margin in the second half of the year for Automation Solutions. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Dave, underlying sales in North America were down 2% in your second quarter but orders were up in March. I think you said mid-teens in North America led by oil and gas MRO and turnarounds. It seems like you saw a decent inflection in North American in March. Have you seen that continue in April? And then the kind of book growth you saw in March could continue. Could you see some upside? When you look at the second half of the year I think you're guiding to modestly up organic sales in Automation Solutions. That's what's implied in your guidance anyway. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, and the answer is yes. In April, I did tell you that April was stronger orders. North America has continued on a very good pace and recovery. We're starting to see including Canada now, and so Canada has started to pick back up which is a good sign because Canada has been very negative. I still think they'll be negative for the year but that we're actually starting to see that. The points, again, I'll repeat. The place we see the improving strength is U.S., Western Europe, China, the rest of Asia including India, and a little bit of improvement in Canada I think I've said. But to the rest of places, Latin America, Middle East/Africa, Eastern Europe, and Russia we're not seeing improvements yet but the key core markets have all started trend line very strong and half of the data points have been continued to map along. Hence, when I made the comment we're above that blue bar that I presented in February, we now have, I think, three months in a row that we're above that blue bar. And including April which we haven't put out, but that's where I see it right now. So the trend line is good, the mix of business is good. But keep in mind, as I've said, in Automation Solutions, as these order pace goes into the 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10% range, you're starting see more medium-term and longer-term projects get into that mix. The MRO is still going to be good, but I still have project mix such that I'm building a good foundation for 2018 at this point in time. That's where we sit. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Have a good afternoon. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: You too. Operator : The next question will come from Scott Davis of Barclays. Please go ahead. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You've got any opportunities for Craig Rossman at Barc, Scott? Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, Craig. It's been a pleasure. I have no opportunities. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: What? You don't want him to work for you, Scott? Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: In fact, we're hiring. Maybe I'll come work for you. Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.: I'll write Scott an offer now. Okay. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I'll work for Craig. I'll answer his phones. How does that sound? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Nice try. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: His career is still on the upper trajectory. I've got a flat line here but... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Don't give me that BS. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Well now that we have that going, let me bust your chops a little bit, Dave. Now that Pentair is closed, the valves business is closed, I mean, what's the playbook that's different from what the previous two owners did? I mean, neither one of them seemed to really be able to make much out of this business. You guys have probably more customers in common than they did for sure. But is it more of a cost issue? Is it marketing and sales? Is it all of the above? I mean, what's really, you think, the playbook that makes this work for you guys that didn't make it work for them? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: There's a couple of big differences here for us. One, we are the largest and broadest automation solutions house in the world as you all know right now from the standpoint of the systems, the flow, the measurement, and now the final control. We are also a business that's very, very global, where we have as much presence in every region in the world be it Asia, be it in the Americas, be it in Europe, be it in the Middle East and Africa. We are a business that actually had driven off of technology that we can pull into play into the new world somewhere on the digital work at that point in time. We're a business that actually have more mechanical and electrical leverage relative to procurement than anybody that's ever owned this business before. We are a business that have a customer base and customer reach where they bring a different customer but we also bring a different customer and we are involved in larger projects where we can bid on big projects of $100 million and we can pull all the package along which they could not do before. So we actually have a lot more to do both from a cost standpoint. But the most exciting part is from our customer standpoint as we now will have a broader package to offer up in the projects, both medium and large, and then also we can do all the service in the aftermarket which they really didn't have enough critical mass. They're having a good start and I have to give credit to Randy and his team. They started this but they just didn't have the critical mass that we have. I mean, if you look at the shift in our business and how we would able to protect our profitability in the downturn, I mean, our business went down just as hard as their business, maybe theirs is a little bit harder, but we protect our margins. Our EBIT margins in our automation business bottomed out in, what, in the 15% to 16% range. They got down single-digit and that's because our aftermarket, what we refer to our KOB 3 business, got up to over 50% of our sales in the downturn. That's the difference. That's our game plan. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And the customers, are they generally fired up to have a more, I guess, intimate player in the space own the asset? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. They're very fired up. There's a couple of reasons. One, is the function of that we actually can support them on the total project, so they have what I refer to as one throat to choke, so they have one player to go after which is Mike Train in the automation space. And secondly, the service thing and the technology and the on-time delivery. Those are all very important to us from the standpoint of how we manage our business, and we're much more regional. We play a regional strategy where we manufacture in the region versus more of a let's export-driven strategy. So, yeah, they're very excited about it. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good to know. Good luck with it, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: And I'm pretty excited about it, too, if you haven't figured that out. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Well good luck. If you can make it work it's going to be a home run for you because you got a good price. So good luck to you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: And if you can think of a good job for Craig, just give me a call, okay? Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I will. All right. Take care. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I'm looking hard, man. I'm trying hard. I'm out there raking the coals right now looking for him. Operator : Our next question will come from John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Dave, Craig. How are you? Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.: Hey, John. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Hey. Good afternoon. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Afternoon. So how much of the $30 million of Byrd and other things you talked about, Dave, were a compare issue for the second fiscal quarter or was that for the year? Or just a little more color there. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: The third quarter was an unusual year. If you look at our historical other other income deduction at corporate costs, just look at corporate. That third quarter last year was very, very low. It was down in the $40 million range and, historically, we're more in the $60 million to $70 million range. And now this one's going to be higher because we're bringing the valves and control in and we have some of the stock price and things like that. So it's a weird comparison. Underlying performance of the company is very, very strong, and the margins are expanding and cash are expanding as we go into it. I have the big offset, $60 million we have to offset in the third quarter. It's a fact. I mean, I can't hold my breath and have it go away. It's there. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Maybe this is a question for Frank. Was any of this relevant to the second quarter as we look at the numbers year-over-year? Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: No. No, not really. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Just the bad debt. No, but that's pushed back at the operation level. We pushed that back in there. That was the only \u2013 Frank? Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: At corporate, there was no significant delta year-over-year in corporate in the second quarter. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: This is the first time I've ever had to tell you on this. I mean, I looked at the numbers. It's the biggest one I've ever seen. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. Can I ask you then about the sequential margin? You gave, I thought, a pretty good answer on sequential margins in Automation Solutions. I did want to ask though, if you look at the MRO you had said last quarter MRO was picking up and that seems to be evident based on growth rates especially in the U.S. MROs got to be really rich mix. Is there some reason that the EBIT margins, Dave, you put up in Automation Solutions weren't a little bit better in the second quarter given the follow-through of MRO and the associated rich mix or is that still more to come or what? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Well I think that the North America sales, they hadn't really turned around yet for the whole quarter. And so we started seeing it significantly in March. The other issue people forgot, and if you remember we had a very, very strong fourth calendar quarter or first fiscal quarter this year in Automation Solutions, and a lot of that was that pent-up demand of MRO that came through and then it did drop off a little bit. And now it's starting to come back in a more flowing basis. So we just had a couple of months there that slowed down, and now the MRO is coming in. And the core profitability of the businesses is very good right now and I expect it to continue to be strong and sequentially get better. So we're in a sweet spot and the orders now are being fairly consistent from the global markets with five months of pretty good North America orders and things like that. I think that it's on a run. It's a good run. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Did you say in your commentary you thought the fourth quarter of Automation Solutions was going to be up, did you say, what, 2.5 to 3 points? So that gets it close to 20%? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Over last year, yes. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Over last year. So that's going to get it close to 20% in the fourth quarter. And that's based on all the... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's not uncommon for us. I mean, we are a profitable company in Automation Solutions. We actually do run 20% margins. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. No, no. I just wanted to make sure I heard that right. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean, if you think about it the sales will be up but from the standpoint they're starting to kick in and how much additional cost we bring back in. We're going to time this. I want our profitability to get back to some good levels before we bring in too much additional cost. A lot of pressure on us right now to put money back in in some technology and things like that. I want to get the margins going the right way for our shareholders. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just lastly, Dave. This mid-teen order growth that you've put up in Automation Solutions, how to think about that? Because the MRO business ultimately didn't drop, say, as much as rig counts and stuff like that; it was dramatically less. Is that sort of a normal bounce you'd see and that's kind of a growth rate that's going to peak but hold or does it get better or are you a little surprised at the mid-teens type of number you've put up recently? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. I think I've mentioned to people before on the road, out talking to people. I expect us to have some quarters just in 15%, 16%. I expect to have some months like that. I would expect us to see, even the rest of this fiscal year, some 10-plus, 15-plus type of orders in certain marketplaces on Automation Solutions. I mean, if the industry's truly starting to turn back into invest both in, first, the MRO and then into the small projects, then our order pattern should build. And, I mean, as someone asked me on the road a couple of weeks ago, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if we don't have underlying orders from Automation Solutions north of 10% by the time we get into that three-month roll, by the time we get to September. So it's not uncommon and it's coming off a hole. As you well know, we had a couple of quarters there, a couple of years during the up cycle last time where we were growing sales 12%, 15%. So I think it's possible. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. No, thanks, Dave. Appreciate it. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Just as possible to have a negative in a month. I mean, this is a volatile space right now relative to this market turnaround. So I think the trend line is good but don't be surprised with some volatility in a month-to-month type of stuff. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Because of projects? Is that why it would go all of the sudden negative? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes, yes. Projects. Yes. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Got it. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You win a project you book a price. I mean, yes, projects. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Operator : And the next question will come from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Hi. Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Maybe just a question on capital deployment. Now that V&C has closed, you did a bit more of a buyback in the March quarter than you'd done in the second half of last year. And, obviously, looking around there was a discrete automation acquisition of some size elsewhere during the last few months as well. So I just wanted to see what your latest thoughts were on the scope for doing M&A over the balance of this year or if buybacks are more preferable near-term? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. We continue to aggressively bid and go after the Automation Solutions acquisitions and also Commercial & Residential. Obviously, we're not successful in one of them. The intention would be is we still would like to see if we can get $500 million, $0.5 billion of acquisitions. I'm not sure we can at this point in time. We've talked to the board about share repurchase being in the $300 million to $500 million level, and that's where we sit right now and there's nothing changed in that. We're out working acquisitions. The opportunities are there and the question will be around is there something that we can land in the next five to six months? If not, then we're going to probably be driving our share repurchase back into that $300 million to $500 million level. We've only got, I think, about $100 million this year, correct? $120 million this year so we have some upside there. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Understood. Thank you. And then just my second question would be around that notion of what sort of price leverage you think you can get now that volumes have started to come back. It sounds like you think volume growth will accelerate. How are you thinking about pricing and capacity in your industries? What your competitors are doing on price over the next sort of six months? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I still think we're in a price cost window right now that's not good as I've said in the last couple of quarters. I think underlying material inflation, a component to inflation, is the point that's increasing. Our pricing power will solidify as we go through this the next couple of quarters. But as I look at the first quarter we've done, I think we're probably pretty neutral, maybe slightly red. I don't know, Frank, what the final numbers were. I would expect as we've just closed this quarter out, we'll be slightly red. I would expect us to be slightly red again. This is between price cost in the third quarter. And we're pushing pretty hard and hopefully we can close that to neutral to slightly green by the fourth quarter and clear it by the first quarter. So we're in that phase right now that we're pushing hard. Material costs are working against us, and so that price cost volume is working. But we've gone through this phase before and I expect by the time we get out of this calendar year our price cost range will be slightly green or neutral. So we're back into the sink. We've had to offset that pressure with other cost reductions across the company. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Understood. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Operator : The next question will come from Gautam Khanna of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: So just a follow-up on Julian's question. In the recent project bookings, have you seen much price erosion if you compare them to what you might've priced these at a year or two years ago? Or are these, in fact, accretive to kind of that view of price cost coming back two and three quarters from now or eventually? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: There's not a whole lot of big projects going on out there at this point. I mean, there's small and medium-sized projects and the pricing of those are in line with what we'd expected from a price cost standpoint or margin standpoint. There's nothing unusual here at this point in time. The bigger projects will be more late 2017, most likely into 2018, and that would be a more relative time period to really discuss what we see the pricing. Right now, people are looking for speed, they're looking for trying to execute. A lot of times, their projects have already been approved. It's already been specced out and awarded. Now they're going to dust it off. So it's a little bit early stages to see what the pricing is on the big projects. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: And just switching to C&RS. Very strong growth for a couple of quarters now in China. What's the duration of this kind of upturn we're seeing there and if you could just expand on what actually explains it? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Relative to China, historically I never look beyond 12 months on a surge of growth because then it has a tendency then it sort of swings back. What explains it is the new technologies we have around our cooling, our air conditioning, and around our refrigeration, and some of the new products and new technologies. And so they're trying to focus relative to the environment and trying to clean air and trying to get rid of some the coal-fired boilers and things like that. We have technology that we had worked with the Chinese government, and those projects are unfolding and we're one of the major suppliers. There's other suppliers but we're one of the major suppliers. And the China government has a big focus on this in particularly in the Northern China spot with trying to clean up the pollution and this is going to take a couple of years. My gut tells me that we'll have a big year for 12 months this year, over a 12-month time period. It'll die back a little bit. First of all, the comparison will be tougher but the programs are not going to die when we get into 2018. There will be just less of an impact coming off obviously a higher base. But right now, it looks like the projects will continue but the growth rates will slow but it'll still be at high levels. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot, guys. Good luck. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Operator : The next question will come from Deane Dray of RBC. Please go ahead. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Just for clarification on the Venezuela write-off. Dave, you made it sound like it was discretionary or maybe the timing was. But could you just provide some color there? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We had cleaned up some of the receivable base and asset base last year with the continued deterioration of what we saw in Venezuela, and this is before even things happened with the GM situation here. We got to assume we're not going to get anything back from these assets and we decided just to take care of it. Receivables? Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: You see, this is just reserving the receivables, the remaining receivables we had on the books down there. In Venezuela. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, that's all there is. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. And then back on Automation Solutions. You don't often talk or call out especially in the same sentence power and life science markets continue to be positive. So what are the key drivers there? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Well the power industry is investing in upgrading from around, if you think about some of the gas industry, you think about using less coal, they're looking at some of the new technologies to allow the plants to run more efficiently with some of the changes coming out of the EPA. I think this will continue to work nicely for us in the North American marketplace. And we're seeing continued power investments throughout Asia Pacific, and even parts of Eastern Europe are seeing some power investments. Now, life sciences have gone through a period here where, if you follow the life science marketplace, we're seeing and have been now for over 12 months an investment period where they're bringing new drugs in, they're bringing new facilities in and there we get, obviously, the control systems. We get some instrumentation and that's been one of the bigger project areas for us and we're doing quite well there. Now there's smaller type of projects but they're still good projects and so we're seeing that investment both in Europe, in North America, and we're seeing a lot of investments going on in Asia, both in India, Southeast Asia, and also China as they're all trying to create their own life science pharmaceutical industry. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. And then just last question from me would be we haven't heard any updates on this so I figured I would ask. Anything from the 15% stake in Network Power that you still own? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: They've only had it for a little while. I mean, I don't think anything is going to happen there for a while. Historically, I would say it'd be a couple of years before anything happens there. I think something will happen relative to our Artisan investment before Network Power because that's been getting close to four or five years now. So nothing there. I mean, I wouldn't expect anything out of those guys yet. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : No, I was asking in terms of its contribution. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Well we don't get any contribution. We don't get any earnings or sales off of that. Earnings, no. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: It's not an ownership stake. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No, it's just an upside stake. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Upside on the back end. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: If they do something well with it. Yeah. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: If they do well with the investment ultimately. Yeah. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Operator : The next question will come from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good afternoon, Dave and everyone. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Jeff. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hey. Nice to see the MRO turning. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Dave, can you give us a little bit of color on actually how V&C performed in the quarter? I know it wasn't yours but any color on revenue...? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. I don't have any idea. I have no freaking idea. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Really? Okay. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. I mean, no. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean, maybe you (43:03) but no. How they performed? Look, I mean, I know where they are relative to sales. I know a little bit of the orders. I know that profitability is down but they've been in disc ops now for, what, eight months. So from my perspective, I'm looking at from May 1 on, that's where I'm caring about and we're working it hard. So we'll talk about that. I think that the timing is going to be pretty good because I think within a couple of quarters we'll start seeing some improvement in orders and stuff like that because the marketplace is starting to turn. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And just thinking about how this rolls through your P&L here. Your guide excludes it but, obviously, we're all going to have to kind of model trying to getting this in. The dilution that you're thinking about for fiscal 2017, I would assume we see a sizable hit here into Q3. And then, I don't know, does it end up being a little bit of accretion in Q4, getting you to the slight dilution? Or how do we just think about the staging of that? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think it's going to be slightly dilutive for both quarters on just pure earnings basis, excluding the one-time accounting changes which we'll have to start booking in the third quarter. So most likely, we'll have a one-time booking in the third quarter. We might have to true it up a little bit in the fourth quarter as we get more knowledge on it. But the underlying earnings, I mean, it's going to be a little bit in the third and a little bit in the fourth. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean, we'll do our best to estimate the one-time purchase accounting but it'll roll through the P&L over the balance of the year and potentially a little bit into next year as well and we'll call it out. But, I mean, it's basically the backlog and the inventory that has to move through. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean, this is something that takes a little time and this is something we could not actually do that we had to stay away from it. And so it's really easy for us to look at earnings and look at what we have to charge from an interest cost or a charge from amortization and things like that or intangible. We can figure those things out pretty quickly. The inventory and the backlog will take us several months. I mean, we'll take an estimate in the third quarter and we'll take another estimate in the fourth. And hopefully by the time we get at the end of the calendar year, we'll get everything trued up. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : So just to be clear then, this $100 million Q3 OIOD does not include Pentair one-offs? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Correct. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: The OIOD we have in there for that piece, and we'll have some more, is basically deal costs. It's paying costs of doing this deal, legal fees, and banker fees, other things like that we've had tied to that. Now that we've closed the deal, we can run through the P&L and we'll have some more running in the fourth quarter, too. There is nothing in there other than what we have that we, Emerson, expended in getting this deal closed. We'll bring in... Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : That's what I'm trying to get at. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. That's true. So that's true. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yeah. Those bankers' fees and stuff don't repeat into next year so, I mean, just trying to think about what the real run rate is for OIOD ex the amortization step-up. Do you have an idea? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. I mean, we're working on it our self and we'll work on it for you, too. But the banking fees, we'll call out. I mean, we'll have some more in the fourth quarter. We'll do the same thing. But, I mean, I'm in the third quarter. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Third quarter. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Third quarter. So we'll keep you informed and they will be delta'd out obviously unless we have some other transaction going on. You won't have that impact next year. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And then just one final unrelated one for me. I don't think you're suggesting this, but we've heard from some other companies that maybe there's been some over-restructuring in some places and now there's a bit of a scramble to kind of catch a demand inflection. Do you see anything like that in your business or any down a supplier or two, down a tier or two? Any issues? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Nope. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : No? Okay. Great. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I'm not trying to wrap around anything. Nope. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : All right. We'll see you in SLA in a couple of weeks. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. Take care. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yeah. Operator : The next question will come from Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Please go ahead. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Rob. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I guess the first question would be in terms of the information on Pentair. Should we expect, kind of following up on Jeff's point, should we expect something pretty definitive, an EPG kind of walking through some refinements of what you've seen and how you think it's going to stage out over the next 18 months? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean, by telling you the EPG I'll have weeks. So I'll give a sense for a little bit of the business, okay? And so what's going on inside the business? And right now we have a lot of work going on trying to bring the two businesses together and that's far more important than pulling together stuff to put on a chart. Relative to the inventory, relative to the backlog, that information will take us several months, several quarters to finalize. Relative to what we see from the P&L, the sales, and the earnings, then I think we'll have a better feel. I can give you a little bit better range after three weeks. So that one we could do. The big number which is the one-time accounting impact, we're going to take our first stab at that relative to the third fiscal quarter when we closed it, and I told you it's going to be a little bit less than I told you in the chart we gave you in February and, hopefully, we can get that down even further as we get through it. But it's a function of what the inventory looks like, a function of backlog, and those are things that we have to get in and do all evaluations on. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Following up on Scott's earlier question about kind of big customers or channel access. I mean, the obvious point here is, perhaps, in the past the valves and controls, the final controls business has been effectively blacklisted in some countries and, obviously, you're not. So can you talk about the opportunities on the revenue side, perhaps, in Saudi or the Middle East or Russia that are just probably more self-evident for you than Pentair? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: On the big projects we can work with, from the countries that struggled with and concerns with, you call it blacklist and I call it sometimes the customer is not quite accepting some of them, we can work that issue. We, obviously, have great relationships and we have a very strong Middle East business, we have a very strong Eastern European and Russian business. We have manufacturing on all of those sites. From our perspective right now, we're starting to bid. In fact, the Pentair team allowed us to bid on several large projects even before we owned them, and when we bid and won on the total package. So we're going to continue to bring them into market. They were not maybe very welcomed in or strong and our organization is very strong globally. We have better customer relationships and we have access to the big projects because of it being driven by systems or control or whatever it is, we can go in and talk to customers. So I think that's going to be something that we can work pretty quickly over a two-year time period and get them back and engage. But we need to work on the regionalization of manufacturing that supply base so they can make sure they can deliver quickly in support of the projects we're winning. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Following up on Julian's question around M&A, clearly and maybe expanding it beyond the initial kind of fiscal 2017, but suffice it to say some of the large properties in automation, it looks like the ship has probably sailed there at least in the near-term. But could you talk about maybe on the Commercial & Residential Solutions side? I think I was tantalized by some comments you made about maybe getting more into industrial compression and obviously there's some assets out there. But could you talk about what could be the M&A strategy on the Commercial & Residential Solutions side in terms of what kind of properties? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean, I don't think the ship's completely sailed on the Automations Solutions. I think there are opportunities out there. We're always working on projects and maybe some of the big ones that won't happen. But there are projects out there all of the time that you can work on and we're working on several right now. The Commercial & Residential, I think that we'll continue to focus on the application, the software, and the measurement sensoring side of the business which really is core to us to deliver what we're calling the sort of the Plantweb of the Commercial & Residential area which is the industrial internet space. So there's some unique assets out there. Nothing of what I would say are large. A large deal there could be $600 million, $700 million. But I think that we're going to continue to buy some software and sensor-based acquisitions there and continue to integrate. The business, as you well know, is doing well right now. We're in the mix of a major global upgrade, an upgrade in investment, in the capital and delivery capabilities of that business. We're starting to see some, as you could see from the profitability standpoint, Bob and his team are doing a good job of leveraging that new cost structure and I think we still have opportunities here for the rest of this year going into next year. I think the opportunities are out there for us; it's just a matter of finding the right ones and then getting them on board. There'll be typically less competition in that space. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Dave, I would pack a fleece for next week. It's still cold up here. See you soon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I'm glad to hear that. Where's Tusa? Who's got the fleece? Is it Tusa? Operator : All right. The next question will come from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Happy afternoon, Rich. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So on... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Since you've got Wells Fargo, it's got a big position here in St. Louis, got any opportunity for Craig? Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I'll look. I'll scout our internet page. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I'd tell you what, I'm not getting a whole lot of warmth here for Craig. I mean, there's not a lot of love here for you. I mean, I might have to (53:11). I mean, I thought Rich liked you. Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.: I thought he did, too. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Lebron's looking for a backup shooting guard. So, I mean, or maybe not. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I thought he was looking for a beer man to hold the beer for him. I mean, I don't think I've ever seen that before in a game. I didn't believe I heard it at first. Go ahead, Rich. Fire away. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So on orders for Automation Solutions, you talked about a transition to mid-sized projects and eventually to larger projects. I know it's early, but as we think about the mix of the sales coming through, it should be pretty healthy I would imagine the rest of the fiscal year. As we can think about 2018 from an incremental margin standpoint, would you call out anything right now that we should consider from a mix of the projects within Automation Solutions? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Still a bit early there, Rich. I mean, as you know I watch this pretty closely and that's why I can give you sort of the background, the color into it. I'm already starting to see some of the projects that had been shelved and iced two or three years ago come back out, those medium, small projects. So in the early stages, as you saw the orders pick back up, we're starting to see the book-to-ship in that base business pretty quick. And so my feeling right now as I see that order mix, and that change is as we've shift into order, positive growth's going to be there. But let's say their order pattern is going to be around the 6%, 7% underlying growth rate. I think they're going to be more in the 3% to 4% real sales growth I think as they start building that backlog. But give me another couple of months to watch this. So that's what I see right now and that tells me that then we'll go into some good medium-sized projects. The MRO is still going to be there but it's going to make up the core growth rate of, say, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, and then as we start getting stronger growth in Automation, that will be those medium projects. And the bigger projects will start booking in 2018, late 2017, and we'll start getting those sales late 2018, early 2019. So it's a little early to say the mix. I expect those guys to have a pretty good margin assuming the MRO and the order book leads the year like I think it could lead the year. We should have a pretty good margin in the first half of 2018 as we go into 2018. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then just on just a shorter-term question...? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Keep asking the question because I'll get more visibility as I get into it. I mean, I won't get it in the next two or three weeks. But I'll tell you what, by the time I get into June I'll have a better visibility on this. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Will do. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I know you will. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And then on Commercial & Residential Solutions, just shorter-term. Do you have a pretty easy comp this quarter? Then it gets much tougher in the September quarter? Should we kind of think of mid to high-single-digit organic growth? And then tailing off in the fourth quarter, low singles? Something like that? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. Last year's third quarter was not good. So we're going to have a very solid mid-single-digit, a higher than 5 mid-single-digit growth based on what I think is going to happen in the third quarter for the Commercial & Residential. It will then be lower for a couple of reasons in the fourth quarter. It'll still be good, in my opinion, in the fourth quarter. One, if you look at the fourth quarter last year, they grew a little bit over 4.5%, about 4.5% underlying sales. China started picking up at that point in time and we saw some pretty good U.S.-based business. So I would say we're going to have a very solid upper mid-single-digit growth in the third quarter and then we're going to have a solid lower than 5% growth in the fourth quarter. That's what I see right now. You're exactly right. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then last one. On restructuring, any change to the $25 million for this year core? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: What are we seeing, $50 million? Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.: $50 million. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: $50 million. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That's $50 million. Okay. All right. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: $25 million Pentair, Rich. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : $25 million Pentair. $54 million. Okay David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You got it. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Great. Thanks. See you in a few. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. See you. Operator : The next question will be from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: There's my sweater vest guy. Where's my sweater vest guy here? Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sweater vest? It's a Patagonia fleece. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: See here, somebody said I had to bring a sweater vest to go someplace. I don't know where I'm going. I'm going to Boston. I mean, you're telling me is going to be cold up there. I need a sweater vest. And the only guy I know that has a sweater vest is Steve Tusa. Fleeces. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Speaking of Boston, I'm reading about some high profile, perhaps, executive opportunities up there if Craig is interested. Just reading that in The Journal, so that might be an idea. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Are they building a new headquarters up there? Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I'm not sure what you're talking about. I think it might be a good idea for Craig. Anyway... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I kid you. I mean, I've heard there's a lot of headquarters being built up in that region up there. Tusa, that's a great idea. Note to self. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, me too. I'll keep that in mind. So on the climate side for next year, you made a kind of an ominous comment in the press release about investing now against those high margins. I mean, can you grow margins next year at climate? And then when we think about the revenue comps on the back of China, can growth there be more than low single digits on the top line? I'm just trying to kind of understand the profile because it is been a bit of an unusual year with very strong China and high margins and you made a comment about kind of investing those away. So maybe just a little bit of color on how that kind of progresses in the next year. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I did not make the comment that we're investing those away. As you know, I still think we have margin ability to get this to 25% as we work the press (58:48) issues. I mean, the comment I want to throw in there is that as you know this industry, and you know this industry pretty well, Steve, there are some major changes coming in here, refrigerants and some efficiency standards relative to both in North America and in Europe that we need to make sure that we stay ahead of our customer base. And so we're making sure those investments are happening. You can't miss a quarter or two in that. I'm not talking about lowering our profitability margins. I just want to make sure that people, as they see the last couple of quarters or the last couple of years, they've seen pretty good margin improvement there. I just want to make sure that they realize that we're going to still have margin improvements in this business in the next couple of years but I've got to make sure we're also investing on this transition that's going to unfold in 2018, 2019, and 2020. We need to make sure that we take advantage of that and pick up some incremental business, incremental share, in that marketplace. That's our game plan. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That makes sense. And then just from an overall company perspective, it's good to see the Zorro jumping over the blue line there. Going forward is this kind of...? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: He definitely barely made it over the blue line and he doesn't have a whole lot of hop-back. He's now the oldest King Charles Spaniel at 15 years in St. Louis. So he's doing well but, boy, I tell you what don't ask him to go up the steps anymore. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's almost as long as you've been CEO, Dave. Fifteen years, right? Sixteen years? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So just on the order of trajectory here, anything moving around in the next couple of months? Can this mid-single digit you talked about in April continue to kind of migrate up into the high single digits over the next couple of months? Or is there some comps? You know just the comps and stuff like that? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Steve, it's going to be Automation Solutions. As you well know, in the Commercial & Residential, the one wildcard we have here is heat in north in the U.S. It was a bad year last year, so comparisons will be pretty easy but there's an element of risk in that area. I think the underlying housing, the underlying basic core spending, Commercial & Residential is good around the world. So that's the one wildcard. I still think that they're going to have pretty good orders in the mid-single digits. The Automation Solutions will be the driver. I mean, as I've said, we put the blue band out and, obviously, we've now had three months above that blue band. I think we'll continue to move on, go through the mid-single digits, probably get into 6%, 7%, 8%, but it's going to be driven by Automation Solutions. And so right now, as I look at North America, I look at Asia which is starting to recover, as I look at some of these marketplaces, I would not be surprised, as I've said earlier, that Automation Solutions orders are not 10-plus percent in the fourth quarter on a cumulative basis. That will pull all of these up unless there's a huge drop off of Commercial & Residential. We also start, as you well know, comparison in more challenging numbers in Commercial & Residential in that fourth quarter. But the trend line's pretty strong right now and if I look at the global GFI numbers, they're improving and have been improving. So the cycle's going right for us right now. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Seems that way. Thanks a lot. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: And, Steve, thank you very much. And I hope you know I'm just kidding you on the sweater vest. I just like to pick on somebody and since you happen to be on the phone I had to pick on you. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's fine. Better me than Scott. He's a little more sensitive to than I am so that's okay. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I know. You have hair, he doesn't. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I have grayed hair. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I didn't say that. See you later. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : To correct you. Thanks. Operator : The next question will be from Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merill Lynch : Hi. Yes. Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merill Lynch : So a question just going back to Automation. On the Middle East, we are getting quite a mixed message from a lot of your competitors and people in the value chain about what's happening there. So because your numbers were down but can you just talk about your geographical mix within Middle East and what areas in the Middle East are dragging the numbers down and which are actually strong? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean, right now Saudi, from an order standpoint, is the best of the best. I think the rest of the marketplace is pretty weak. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merill Lynch : Wow. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: From Africa. So, I mean, we're very much project business-driven there. So I would say right now Saudi has the best light for us. Kuwait is doing well. That's another one that's doing well. But those are the two that we see right now. So from our business standpoint, there's not a lot of big activity going on. It's primarily MRO, small stuff, and the business is basically \u2013 They think they're going to go with flat; I think they're going to be down for the year. So that's what I see at this point in time. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merill Lynch : Got you. And as the Middle East comes back, do you anticipate any problems with collections in terms of hit to working capital as you grow that business or is it just...? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. Our Middle Eastern customers have always paid us. They pay us on time. Our business, our products are kind of instrumental to running the plants. And so if they can't turn the plant on because they didn't pay me, sometimes it's a problem for them. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merill Lynch : And just a different question. ABB bought B&R and we just got back from Hanover. And a lot of focus all of the sudden, industrial controls capability is very important to being this gateway to getting the data on the cloud. And I know I've asked this question before, but given how the cloud is evolving has it changed your view on the need to have more presence on the industrial side? And I know this question has been asked before, but it does seem that IoT is evolving in this direction. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: The Europeans are driving it. It's being driven very hard by the Siemens (1:04:56) ABB in a big way. We have continued to expand on the hybrid and on the discrete side. So we'll continue to do that. I mean, that's why I show the charts. We show the charts that we move across that way. And we'll continue to buy. That was a very nice acquisition from New York. And so from that perspective, I understand where they're going from it and it's the same strategy we have ourselves. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merill Lynch : Terrific. Thanks a lot. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: So I'd like to wrap it up. I want to thank everybody for your time today. Appreciate the questions and, hopefully, I didn't upset too many people with having fun with them a little bit. But I am serious. Craig, as we're looking at Craig moving on to his next assignment and it will be inside Emerson, it will be something important. And then Frank and I will probably be covering for him because he did not do a good job at developing a successor which is something I'm really upset about but we'll take care of that in his bonus. But with that, I thank everybody and look forward to seeing everybody down at EPG. And I'll make sure I take a sweater when I go to Boston later this month. Thank you very much. Bye. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

LLC Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Emerson's Investor Conference Call. During today's presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. This conference is being recorded today, August 1, 2017. Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Tim Reeves (1:11), Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead, sir. Unverified Participant : Thank you, Chad. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Train, Executive President, Emerson Automation Solutions; and Bob Sharp, Executive President, Emerson Commercial and Residential Solutions. Today's call will summarize Emerson's fiscal 2017 third quarter results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. I will start with the third quarter summary, as shown on slide 2 of the slide presentation. In the third quarter, both segments grew sales to deliver 4% underlying sales growth for the company. Reported sales grew 10% to $4 billion, including the results of the Valves & Controls acquisition, which closed on April 28 during the quarter. The quarter results reflect strengthening momentum across our key served markets. I will take a moment now to discuss our June underlying orders. All commentary refers to June trailing three-month orders, excluding currency and acquisitions, which, for the consolidated company, was up 9%, marking the sixth consecutive month of positive orders. Starting with Automation Solutions orders, the platform was up 9% with growth across all world areas, except Latin America. Europe was up low single digits; Asia, up high single digits; and North America and Middle East/Africa both increased double digits. The broad-based momentum reaches across end markets as well with continued favorable trends in oil and gas, power, life sciences and chemical markets. Moving to Commercial & Residential Solutions orders, the platform was up 8%, led by North America, Asia and Europe. Growth in North America reflected acceleration in residential air conditioning and professional tools in oil and gas and construction-related markets, as well as continued high single-digit demand in refrigeration markets. Asia growth remains broad-based reflecting steady demand in HVAC and refrigeration markets, as well as continued strong electric heat pump activity in China. Demand in Europe remains strong, reflecting favorable conditions in HVAC and refrigeration markets. We are encouraged by the continued strength in orders, and note that these trends are consistent with expectations communicated at the Electrical Products Group Industry Conference in May. Moving back now to our quarter results, earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding Valves & Controls, was flat at $0.68, in line with guidance provided on the second quarter earnings call. Operating cash flow generation was strong at $774 million in the quarter, driven by improvement in trade working capital management. Turning to slide 3, profitability in the quarter was affected by the Valves & Controls acquisition, by both first-year acquisition accounting charges as well as dilution from operations. Excluding Valves & Controls, gross margin was approximately flat and EBIT margin was down 40 basis points, reflecting a prior-year gain of $18 million. Earnings per share from continuing operations was down 7% due to a $0.05 impact from the Valves & Controls acquisition, comprising $0.04 from first-year acquisition accounting charges and $0.01 from operations. Let's move now to slide 4. Global demand conditions strengthened versus the second quarter. Emerging markets were up low single digits and mature markets grew mid-single digits. Growth was supported by improving end markets in the U.S. and Asia and early signs of improving demand conditions in Canada. Growth in Asia accelerated during the quarter, led by China. Excluding China, the rest of the region also improved, growing at low single digits in the quarter. Turning to slide 5, total segment margins, excluding Valves & Controls, improved 80 basis points to 20.9%, driven by the benefits of restructuring actions and leverage on higher volume. Corporate and other charges increased $75 million, driven by $37 million of Valves & Controls' first-year acquisition accounting charges related to inventory and backlog amortization, $13 million of higher acquisition costs and a prior-year gain of $18 million on payments received related to dumping duties. Free cash flow from continuing operations was $668 million, up 24% versus prior year and year-to-date free cash flow was $1.5 billion, up 11% versus prior year. Free cash flow conversion, excluding Valves & Controls, was 143% in the quarter and 123% year-to-date. Trade working capital, excluding Valves & Controls, improved 1.2 points to 16.1% during the quarter, with improvement across all three components of trade working capital, led by improvement in accounts receivables. Turning to slide 6, Automation Solutions underlying sales grew 2% and net sales grew 12% to $2.4 billion, including results from the Valves & Controls acquisition. Energy-related life science and chemical markets continued positive momentum, with most end markets focused on MRO and optimization projects. Growth in North America was supported by a return to growth in Canada, reflecting renewed activity in unconventional oil and gas. General industrial markets were favorable, particularly in Asia and Europe, resulting in high single-digit growth in our industrial solutions products. Latin America remained down and has not yet begun to recover. Middle East and Africa was down 2%, but the market there has turned. Margin, excluding Valves & Controls, improved 170 basis points to 17.9%, reflecting the flow-through of benefits from restructuring actions and leverage on higher sales. Based on continued strengthening of our end markets, we now expect full year underlying sales for the segment to be down 1% to 2% versus our prior guidance of down 2% to 3%. And let's turn now to slide 7, and I will hand it over to Mr. Mike Train. Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.: Tim (8:05), thanks, and thanks for that last chart. We've been looking for that one for a while. Been two years of very rugged market conditions. And I thought it'd be a good idea to update you on our project funnel that we shared with you back in our February meeting. At that time, we laid out expectations that we'd see some recovery in our aftermarket products and services, our KOB3, as we call it, followed by smaller projects at existing sites and then eventually, the formation of some of these larger greenfield projects. I do believe we are seeing this play out as expected. On the large project funnel, we have seen significant growth in the funnel as more projects are being put back into play, principally in the oil and gas, refining and the metals markets. Chemicals in North America also remains very active and very good for us. We will see several projects in the funnel get approvals to proceed in 2018, probably half of what's depicted on this chart, should have decisions in 2018, and then I'll go through the award-order-execution sales process that typically follows and plays out typically over a 12 to 24-month period. So I anticipate we'll see some of these longer-cycle deliveries start to mix into our backlog as we get into next year. But it should set us well next year and I think even maybe better for 2019. So we're pretty excited about what we're seeing right now. There's a lot of good optimism out there. I just wanted to add if I've the time, been around the world talking to customers as part of the Operational Certainty, and Plantweb Digital Ecosystem launches and there's a lot more optimism out there as we go forward. Oil price has been bouncing around the $40s, that's made some people a little bit nervous, but I think generally they are putting a lot of energy into it, and they are open to ideas to operate better, and I think we're really striking a chord there. So I think we're clearly seeing them, I think some of the investment we're seeing now in the shorter cycle of goods is related to them willing to operate better. So, very positive I think (9:52). David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I'd like to add, Mike, I want to also thank you and your team for the first 100 days, the first 95 days of integration of Valves & Controls. A lot of work by you and your team, and all the Valves & Controls people out there and it's not easy and everything that's going on right now. And so high expectations as we go into 2018, but still an outstanding acquisition and really brings a lot as you know from a customer perspective. Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes, very exciting. Even more. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. Thank you very much. If you could pass it on to the team for me, appreciate that. Unverified Participant : All right, thanks, Mike. Turning to slide 8, Commercial & Residential Solutions sales increased 7% on both a net and underlying basis reflecting strong global demand. North America, which was up 6%, was driven by robust growth in residential air conditioning, and solid growth in refrigeration, professional tools and do-it-yourself products at big box retailers. Growth of 17% in Asia was led by China air conditioning and refrigeration markets. Excluding China, the rest of the region was up low single digits in the quarter. Margin remained near record high levels and leveraged 40% sequentially versus the second quarter. Versus prior year, margin declined 50 basis points due to unfavorable mix from growth in residential air conditioning and the usual timing lag between material inflation and realization of pricing actions. This is in line with margin guidance previously communicated, and we continue to expect higher second half sales deleverage at 40% sequentially versus the first half as discussed at the Electrical Products Group Industry Conference. Full year net and underlying sales growth is expected to be 5% to 6%. And let's turn now to slide 9, and I will hand it over to Mr. Bob Sharp. Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.: As many of you know, the Commercial & Residential business is comprised of some key franchises, if you will, very solid growth dynamics and certainly exceptional profitability and asset management. Names like RIDGID and InSinkErator and Copeland are really synonymous with the categories we serve. Our attention now is really focused on the top line, having the necessary number of incremental programs to drive sales growth above the market with a one plus kind of a point above market target that we have. A big part of that is the solutions focus, and a lot of our programs are around that. We're certainly meeting that this year comfortably above a point of market as we calculated, and we feel good about the programs and the momentum we have as you can see in our order rates going into next year. This chart shows a number of the key ones going on. In residential, certainly a big story for us is what's happening in China with heat pumps, driven heavily by Beijing's interest in air quality and some other dynamics. We have over 100% growth in that area this year after a very strong ramp up last year as well. A big news, if you noticed, one of our large customers launched some new 16 SEER to 18 SEER product with our UltraTech \u2013 multi-stage product, UltraTech, noting in the promotion that it's a Copeland technology and promoting comfort at a value, which we feel is a very key part of the U.S. market. There's been a lot of attention on variable speed over the years. In fact, this category, this area at one point was thought to be something that would be a variable speed application, and we consider it a very strong endorsement of UltraTech to have that news. You can see some other programs around sensing and European heat pump activity also. Over on food chain, we've launched ProAct Cargo. This is a combination of the Locus Traxx and PakSense businesses we bought. We have those together now as one business with a tiered product offering. It's ramping up nicely. And a big part of our attention right now is leveraging the international infrastructure that Emerson provides to these small companies to get at either the grower or the specifier side for a total international supply chain. That's going very well. Food waste is a big topic. Food is a very big issue for environmental emissions both on the commercial side with Grind2Energy as well as homes. There's a lot of opportunity for more responsible disposal of food using the disposers. And then we've got a nice program going on right now, a good synergy between the RIDGID business and refrigeration is that a customer of ours, who does the fittings for plumbing, sees refrigeration as a very important growth area for them. They like the idea that we can team up our pressing capability at RIDGID with our refrigeration knowledge and we have basically a troika working on this now and it's a very significant growth opportunity for us as well as this customer. So, a lot of good programs going on. Again, we feel good about the market we're having, the growth we're having now. We'll be at the top end of that 5% to 6% range we talk about and also feel good about the momentum going into next year. Unverified Participant : Okay. Thanks, Bob. Let's turn to slide 10 and walk through our 2017 outlook. Net sales growth is now expected to be approximately 5% including the results of the Valves & Controls acquisition. Underlying sales growth is unchanged from prior guidance at 1%. Automation Solutions segment underlying sales is revised to down 1% to 2% versus prior guidance of down 2% to 3%. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying and net sales growth is unchanged from prior guidance at 5% to 6%. With solid cash performance year-to-date, we now expect to exceed our $2.5 billion operating cash flow target. Based on strong operational performance and order trends we are raising our 2017 earnings per share guidance. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance is $2.58 to $2.62 and includes $0.05 dilution from Valves & Controls operations. On a comparable basis, our previous guidance per share \u2013 earnings per share guidance was $2.50 to $2.60, including the $0.05 dilution from Valves & Controls operations. As part of our continued portfolio repositioning, we anticipate an agreement on the divestiture of our ClosetMaid business in the fourth quarter. And now, I'll turn the call over to Mr. David Farr. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much. I want to thank Mike and Bob for stopping in and talking a little bit about their businesses. Bob's had a great year with tremendous premium performance and running at record levels of profitability across the company and really making investments necessary to serve the industry and being the leader that we are in this industry. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I also want to thank the entire global organization in delivering a very solid quarter in positive sales, improved profitability, extremely strong cash flow with \u2013 conversion of free cash flow to earnings in the third quarter of 140% and year-to-date running over 120%. So, a very strong execution, back to back years in cash flow and very, very important to us. As I said earlier, our first 100 days or nearly 100 days of the Valves & Controls acquisition are well underway. Integration is going extremely well and we're on track to have strong cash flow accretion in 2018 and earnings accretion, excluding the one-time earnings or inventory and backlog valuation, which will still flow through in the first three or four months of fiscal 2018. A great job to the whole Automation Solutions team, especially around Final Control and the Valves & Controls team. We're extremely excited about this team of the people. We're really excited about the opportunity with this acquisition and we see a lot of good upside, both in growth and also profitability and cash. The opportunities are still there. There's no difference from what we saw when we did the acquisition and the marketplace is starting to turn up and we're seeing those improvements as we come forward, so real excited about the first 100 days, but, again, we have the next 100 days and we got all of next year to deliver and get ready for the long-term value creation of this acquisition. The quarter came in as expected. I think if you go back and look at the transcript, I was pretty clear about the underlying sales and earnings expectations. I think I probably told you $0.86 \u2013 $0.68, I'm sorry, $0.68. $0.68 and \u2013 that's where we came in. It's just \u2013 we could see that that's where it was heading. The one positive of the cash flow and the orders were a little bit stronger and we're setting ourselves up for a very good fourth quarter and we're looking forward to having a good fourth quarter with strong underlying sales, improved profitability and strong cash flow. Looks to us, right now, as we look at the last couple of months, assuming we execute around $2.60, plus or minus a couple of pennies, that includes a nickel dilution from the Valves & Controls operations performance not included in the one-time backlog inventory valuations or revaluations. Orders are trending exactly like we thought they would as we reported in May at EPG. They're well within that band, and I still believe they'll trade in that band. The band at that point I think it was around 8% to 12%. I would expect maybe we could have a month at the high end of that band, and we could have a month at the low end of that band, but still trending pretty well where we thought they would. Good mix. And as I've said earlier, we really need another two or three months of knowing that mix of orders relative to Mike's business and how that unfolds relative to short, medium, and long-term growth rates and the cycles where the orders are coming in. But clearly right now, we're seeing a mix starting to move towards the small and medium-size projects. As Mike showed you, he's got an increasing funnel, which we track on a global basis and really, obviously, seeing some big projects coming out that will start hitting us in early fiscal 2018, maybe even towards the end of fiscal 2017. But, clearly, a lot going on. The wins as we see the global marketplaces and gross fixed investments, we're still seeing a very good performance relative to the fixed investments around the U.S., around Western Europe, around China, Asia. We're seeing some improvement from Middle East. If you remember the last call, I was somewhat concerned about the Middle East, but that's turning right now. Investments are starting to happen. And maybe, and I mean maybe, Mexico might actually start growing again, and so that will be good to see if they get some money freed up. So we have a lot of markets going our way at this point in time. Around the profitability improvement, Automation Solutions underlying business without V&C is improving on the trend line that we thought, a very good performance. Obviously, that we'll have to continue as we try to drive back towards our historical levels of profitability. The Valves & Controls business came in at lower-profit margins, as we all talked about last time, around that 5% EBIT. We're working hard to offset that margin, but it'll take several years, many years to do that. But from the standpoint of the underlying valuation or profitability of our Valves & Controls business, it's still going to be an 18% to 19% as we absorb this in the future. It's exactly what we laid out when we did the acquisition. The big opportunity relative to the solution package is the growth, and the new customers, new markets are still very good. Again, that will pay out in the future, not in the near-term. And the most important thing in the near-term in the next couple of years really is the potential trade working capital on all Final Controls relative to V&C and also our Final Control business. We still believe that we have $300 million to $400 million of trapped cash sitting in there in that working capital that will help us drive down our dividend to free cash flow ratios back below 50%, hopefully sooner than later. We're making great progress this year across the whole corporation and then cash flow, and we're seeing an improvement in the ratios and that's very, very important relative to the long-term capability for us to invest in the company and do what we want to do from an acquisition standpoint, and also make sure we maintain our dividend record and move towards actually starting to get off the minor increases towards more meaningful increases once we get back below 50%, toward that 45%. Clearly, a very strong focus point of ours and one that we're working hard on. And if we can deliver $300 million to $400 million of cash off the Final Control, that makes the net purchase price for that business even less. Relative to Commercial & Residential, they're running at tremendous performance right now, premium to the market and underlying growth and sales growth running at very high levels of profitability \u2013 record levels of profitability. Yes, people can look at it quarter-to-quarter and say, hey, looks like things are going bad, but keep in mind, that business delivered leverage at 40% incremental sales in the quarter and will do it again in the fourth quarter. That business is a very profitable business, and, yes, we have to deal with the price cost ratios, which are a little bit tougher than we thought just two or three months ago, but they're very manageable and we're dealing with those issues, and we're running at record levels of profitability and investing in the next generation for refrigeration, next generation of control and solutions, and really a good job relative to overall driving incremental growth, incremental profitability and Craig Rossman is here again today and after the first 60 days, he still hasn't screwed up the business, he's taken it over, but we'll give him another 60 days and we'll check on you, Craig, and we'll take a close look at you. I mean, just don't want you to mess up over there too much, and very important to me. I want to thank the improved earnings and underlying earnings and improved cash flow as we go into the second half this year. Strong operational performance across the company, and really I think a good finish to the second half of fiscal 2017, and really a good start relative to orders and our cost structure and our overall profitability as we go into fiscal 2018. So I'm looking forward to a good start and a lot of work we have to finish the year, clearly, and we have two months left. But I like the position we're in right now, I like the momentum we have across the company and I'm looking forward to getting this year behind us and really having growth both at the top line and in the earnings line and the cash flow line which is better than we thought originally. But one thing I'd like to close the call with before we open up questions \u2013 to take questions is that, unfortunately, many of you have known me for a long time and have been around a long time know the conference call, I've always referred to our dog, Zorro and Zorro (24:53) is probably on his last couple of months or couple of weeks or couple of days. He's been with me for 15 years, an outstanding King Charles. Guy's got tremendous heart, but his body is not quite there anymore, but I just want to let you know for the people that do know me and have known me talk about Zorro (25:14) over the years is we're down to the last couple of days and that's an unfortunate situation. But we'll get over it and we'll move on to the next one. And so with that, I want to close the call and take the questions for a few minutes. And with that, turn it over to the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question today will come from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Morning, everybody. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good morning, John. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Afternoon. My mistake, afternoon. Hey, did currency play any sort of significant role in the raising of the guidance versus when you set guidance last... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No, no. Not at all, John. This is not a currency driven movement here. This is just a little bit better performance relative to the underlying sales and a little bit better performance relative to conversion on profitability. So that's where we sit right now. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And then, Dave or Mike, do you have what Valves & Controls did maybe if you could pro forma it on the core growth basis in the quarter? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Core growth. What Valves & Controls did on their own self? John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, yes. Roughly. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Valves & Controls business was down, I would say. We had them for two months. They were down. Their order pattern had been down for quite some time. So the Valves & Controls business is still trending down the top line. As you know, we talk about, we're actually going to start pruning some of the product lines out of the Valves & Controls. We're actually going to sell pieces out of Valves & Controls. We told you that we'd shrink it first and focus on the core pieces that we really want and drive the profitability up from there. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: The oil and gas projects you listed out, Mike, I think the average I think I just ran the numbers quickly, is like $49 million a project. How would you say that compares kind of versus historicals? Because if you compare it to the other ones you listed, they're actually amongst the larger ones. So I'm just curious to put it in a context. Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.: I think the oil and gas projects we're looking at right now, there's some very sizable ones out there. I don't know if they are as big as that Prelude (27:40) type of thing that we've done in the past. But there's many of them out there. I think there's been a massive underinvestment the last few years and people are getting back in line and starting to evaluate these things. So we've added $1 billion to the funnel principally in oil and gas, a few other areas, but principally in oil and gas and there's a lot of interest there right now. A lot of things are being resurrected and starting to move. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just lastly, Dave, I mean, I think your orders run into kind of tougher compares toward the end of the calendar year. Do you believe just based on your experience, the cadence of business and kind of what you've got going on, that maybe we \u2013 you talk sort of about 8% to 12% for a month or two at the high end. Does this thing sort of settle at kind of a mid-single-digit type of order cadence kind of over the coming quarters? Or do you think it does a little bit better? Or how should we think about it do you think? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean, right now, it depends really what happens relative to some of the key markets and there's some GFI forecasts which are starting to get better towards the end of this calendar year and early into next year. But I still say that our cadence is going to probably be in the 6% to 8% range as we go into the \u2013 as we get past these easier comparisons right now. But that's my first gut right now. I'd be saying that 6% to 8% type of trend and we'll see what happens, but every month goes by we'll get a better view of it, but I would say it's going to be sold single digits, yes. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Appreciate it. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thanks, John. You're welcome. Operator : The next question will be from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Rich. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey. Just, Dave, on the guide with A&S getting a little bit better, less worse, for the year. Bob talked about Commercial Residential Solutions being at the top end, and then the overall organic growth... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I don't know the acronym. What acronym, Rich, did you use? I couldn't understand that. I mean, we have an Automation Solutions business, we have a Commercial Residential Solutions business. Help me out here, which one are you talking about? Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So Automation Solutions view... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you, Rich. Thank you very much. Thank you. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : A&S, Automation Solutions. So that was raised a little bit, less worse. And then CR&S was going to be at the top end of the guide. So there's no change in the underlying organic growth rate for the company, you know, negative one or plus one. Sorry. So is that just rounding? Or is that just... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's just rounding, it's rounding, Rich, and good analytical (30:12) work there. It's rounding. We're having better conversion relative to some of the margin and the profitability mix going well for us right now. Things are trending the right way, certain businesses are doing well right now. So I think that's what's going on from that perspective. We are a little bit cautious in the conversion of profitability. We know that Bob's business in the Commercial Residential Solutions was doing some investments, but he's still getting some pretty good growth rates. We know that Mike's business was this ember (30:39) always lasts a little longer than the pent-up demand lasts a little longer, so he's getting a little bit better mix there too. So those are all things helping us right now. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And then just back on the incremental margin as you start to \u2013 I know you don't have a ton of visibility into 2018 at this point, you need a few more months of orders. But how do we think about incremental margin? You had a great number this quarter for Automation Solutions in terms of conversion. As we think about what you have in the basket right now in the backlog, and the trends right now for mid-size projects, and then eventually getting to larger projects. How do we think about 2018? Just initial view in terms of how incremental margins start to play out over the next three to four quarters? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You are going to have to run \u2013 Automation Solutions is going to have to run in the mid-30s, to \u2013 what will happen again will be the mix, and that's what we want to watch over the next couple of months. But they're going to have to run in the mid-30s on the incremental to keep driving back up towards that 19% that we're trying to get to in the next several years. So, 19% EBIT. So that's what they're going to have to run. Commercial Residential Solutions the issue for me right now is I'm talking to Bob and his team. It's all about, can they continue to run a premium growth rate relative to the market. If they can do that, then they're going to be running at record levels of profitability, and obviously from the perspective of that, we'll drive a pretty good margin, but at the same time gives them plenty of room to invest with that growth. So that's where we see it right now. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then just last one, price/cost is still negative 25 for the year, that still (32:12)? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's going to be a little bit more negative now. Steel pricing has been a little bit more negative from the standpoint, but still very manageable at this point in time. I think it's going to take us one more quarter to settle it out as we get into fiscal 2018 it will be a little bit better. But as you've been hearing on the calls, it's been a little bit tougher out there this year relative to price cost. But fortunately, we have a pretty good process. We got ahead of it and Bob's team was able to offset it with incremental margins relative to the price cost this quarter. And it's just \u2013 it's a little bit more challenging now than what it was, but still very manageable. Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. I'll pass it on. Thanks so much. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much, Rich. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question will be from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good afternoon, guys. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Andrew. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Dave, how are you doing? So, you mentioned at EPG that their business is about five to six months behind Emerson in the cycle usually, and you bought the business, didn't have much backlog. But you didn't seem to allude in your prepared remarks that the business is turning or that it had turned? Maybe give some more color on that? Have you seen a turn in that business yet? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes, we have. Actually, Mike showed the board today the order pattern \u2013 I guess it was not Mike, but it was Rahm Kreshner (33:33) showed it, but we're running about six months behind, five or six months behind, and they're still slightly negative. The curve is up and you think they're going to cost, what, Mike... Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.: I think soon, because you know, we had positive orders in March. So I think they are coming. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: They're coming. So, they're coming up the curve. The incline's in the right way right now. If you think about the whole all Automation Solutions curve, they are coming right up that curve, but they're five or six months behind us right now. And so incremental we're out doing sales together right now, that's starting to work pretty quickly. So that's good news. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And Dave or Frank, I'm a little confused, maybe I should know this, but it looks like you did negative $0.01 in your operations in 3Q and then you're guiding to negative $0.04 in 4Q. Is that just extra restructuring? I know there's an extra month in there, you only had two months in 3Q but what is that in 4Q? Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.: It's restructuring and the amortization which is booked in the segment. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. One extra month of... Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.: Amortization. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Amortization. But you're right. It's $0.04 in the quarter versus $0.01. Exactly right. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then, Dave, just on the large projects, it does seem like Mike is a little more optimistic. You've said that you expect them to start coming back late in 2018. Is that still what you're thinking for the majority of these large projects? Or do you think maybe things have gotten a little better in that standpoint? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I'll give you my answer on that; Mike can give you \u2013 I think that \u2013 I think our customer base, the price of oil stability, the refinery business, the global marketplace, I think the large projects \u2013 or medium-size projects are going to maybe happen a little bit earlier. I'm still a little bit cautious about the large ones. I think there's still sight of line on capital spending for my \u2013 our large customer base. But clearly they're firming. And one can be more optimistic, but I'd like to see that funnel continue to shift to the left and continue to grow on the outer side. But my feeling right now is it's a little bit better but you still have to be cautious and \u2013 because I'm going to watch the capital. And I still think our customers are being cautious with capital right now. Now, Mike, what are you feeling? Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.: I think those are fair remarks. I mean we're getting into conversations with these guys because they want to get things ready to go. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.: And we're going to look at their next couple of quarters as they make their decisions. But I think there is a lot more optimism around getting some stuff moving now, so we're going to have to see how it plays out. We saw the reports last week out of the oil companies. We know where their heads are. We're working that. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. I think that there's one difference, Andrew, that last year at this time, I talked about that we saw the MRO coming; don't be surprised as we finish the calendar year fiscal year, we'd start seeing some pent-up MRO come forward. This year, that's continuing to go, but really what's going to happen this year as we go out of this year and go into next year, I think you're going to see formation of the money's being set aside for the projects. And that will be a key point for us as we go into the budget setting of our customer base in that January time period. And I think this year they're going to say okay, money's being allocated and the project is going to start being let. So maybe a month or two sooner, but will see. That's where I am right now. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome, Andrew. Operator : The next question will be from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you very much. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Afternoon. Maybe a first question on the cash flow and the usage of the cash. I think you talked previously about the $300 million to $500 million or so buyback range. Clearly, I guess you're coming in probably at the very high end of that for the year. Maybe just update your buyback thoughts and how you see the acquisition pipeline today? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: So the buybacks is at $400 million, and so that's where we are right now and I mean we're pretty well stocked for the rest of this fiscal year. Yes, cash flow is good, but right now, the buyback is pretty well set at the $400 million. We're not going to change it at this point in time. We're probably looking at the same amount next year, somewhere between $400 million and $500 million next year. It's our current view of it at this point in time. From the acquisition standpoint, I don't think there's been much change. I think we're still trying \u2013 looking this year at some incremental small deals. I don't know if we're going to get those done or not. But we're typically looking again, somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion over the next 12 months of acquisitions. So our cash flow right now is very good. And clearly at this point in time, we don't have anything major burning through that we're going to ramp up share repurchase or ramp up and do a big deal at this point in time. Frank, do you have anything on there? Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: No. I think that's exactly right. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: So that's what we see right now. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. And then just on the organic sales growth outlook, so I think you're guiding for about 5% growth in Q4, and at EPG you talked about 4% to 5% growth in 2018. So do we see this current trend as sort of steady? Or do you think your growth can accelerate on the revenue line, at least towards the end of the calendar year, beginning of calendar 2018 and then sort of slows down after that with orders? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. So on the growth rate in the fourth quarter, we're looking at about the same growth rate we saw in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And then I would say that we would \u2013 I mean I think what we \u2013 the 5% to 6% is the number I gave you at EPG in May. And I'm still saying at this point in time, I don't see any change at this point in time. So there'll be some slight acceleration and it's driven off of \u2013 it's going to be driven off of Automation Solutions. And from our standpoint, I mean Mike's business will continue to convert. And obviously he's got easier comparisons in the first half of this year because he was down probably on average 5%. And so he has a pretty easy comparison in the first half of next year. But I'm still looking around that 5% type of growth rate, 5% to 6% type of growth rate right now going into 2018, underlying growth rate. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. And on AS within the MRO piece of that, do you think you've made \u2013 you're quite some way now through that catch up MRO activity, and that will start to fade away? Or you think there's still a little bit of MRO pent-up demand left? Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.: My point of view is it's still strong. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's still pretty strong. I don't see \u2013 I think \u2013 I would never accuse any of our customer base of cannibalizing or not spending enough money on MRO, but I think they understand, and I think that it's going to be good for a while here. I think we're going to be positive for a while. We're seeing it in North America. We're now starting to see it in Asia. We're going to start seeing it in the Middle East. So it's starting a wave around the world right now. So it's a good thing for us at this point. I'd love to see it continue nicely in the first half of 2018. That would really give Mike a chance to get some of the medium-size projects onboard and working them. So that's what I see right now. I do not see a slowdown too much. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Operator : The next question will be from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Steve. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sincerely sorry to hear about Zorro (40:43). David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. I appreciate it. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : A lot of candor, a lot of banter over the years, but you guys both have had a very, very good run. So you should hold his head up high definitely. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I will, definitely. I've been doing that, and I brought my Rally Monkey in today, too, for Zorro (40:58) today. So I have my Rally Monkey in here, too, and I've got two baseball bats and my Rally Monkey, and we're all in here saying... Unknown Speaker : Got them right (41:04) David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean, I have to break Tim (41:06) in. I'm going to hit him over the head with a baseball bat in a second, but (41:12) did not warn him about some of the physical things we do in our conference calls like dropping baseball bats on my floor, but go to your question, Steve. Thank you very much for your comments. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes, and sincerely. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So on the Climate business, so obviously you have some raw pressure coming through. How do you kind of see there the pricing environment as you go in? I mean, I assume you're going to be negotiating on kind of that round of pricing with the OEMs this fall, or is that pretty much kind of \u2013 or maybe year end? I'm not sure. Or is that set in stone for kind of next year? Is that something that we worry about and have to assume the OEMs are going to execute on their price increases as well, because everybody's kind of feeling the pinch here a little bit in HVAC? Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.: Well, I think if you go back, first of all, in 2016, if you notice, we took a very nice step in margin, because we had material pricing that was very favorable versus the customer pricing changes. 2017, we do have a lag, and in some cases we have clauses where we'll pass through, so we got some pass through of that 2016 benefit we captured. And then, with the material inflation pickup, that causes a bit of a squeeze period, if you will. But, again, that's normal phasing. That'll play out into 2018. And then, for us, the cost reductions and product mix are a big part to the total equation as well, things like UltraTech, things like the K6 compressor and cost reductions, especially on DIY kind of stuff. And I would say, again, we've seen this coming for a long time. It's come as we thought, and it'll go in 2018. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. We have a lot of contractual stuff around as we go back and forth, and so there's leads and lags. Last year, we had a record, record quarter in profitability, and we had that kind of price cost deposit for us. So, Steve, I think we're pretty well set, and I think the OEMs see this coming, and we're working it right now, and clearly we give back and forth in this. So I think everyone is in pretty good shape right now, and we're not behind the eight ball here at all. So we're in pretty good shape. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then just on Valves & Controls, so we kind of move forward into this cycle and you have this new Pentair business. Perhaps not \u2013 selling in solutions may be a little bit different than selling your really, really high quality, rich margin type of products. Should we expect a different level of incrementals, perhaps a different profile of cash flow as you sell \u2013 as you go to market as more of a solutions provider as opposed to a just really super high-end device guy? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : No? It's same kind of pricing dynamics. You're not really \u2013 you're not just going for the revenue here? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. It'd be the same similar dynamic. Obviously, on the mix of our business, you know, Steve, in the mix of business, our control systems are typically lower margin and certification is (43:59) higher. Valves are sort of the medium, some of the Valves & Controls stuff are a little bit lower, but the mix is there. There's not going to be any change in profitability and cash flow. It's the same. Again, the revenue, the aftermarket, the key stuff here, which we're very strong in. There's not going to be any significant change in your modeling relative to the Automations business and the Final Control business at all. I think the one thing that we do have in the long-term, it's not in the next two or three years, is really a big increase potential in the aftermarket business. So, I think Pentair and Randy Hogan had just started this and he did not have the same critical mass we have. I think in years five, six and seven I think you're going to start seeing us better service contracts, longer-term contracts, we're already starting to see some of that. That will give us a better mix than they had historically themselves. Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.: We're working hard on the operational footprint as we go forward, so we can hit those shorter lead times with those type of products. That's the big difference. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. Big difference in the margin, too. I'm optimistic on it, Steve. I wouldn't worry about that too much right now. That's not my worst problem, there. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then one last question, very high level and no offense to your operating guys, but you never really had operating guys on the call before, your segment heads. What was the call on bringing these guys on? I mean, it was great color. Don't get me wrong. But I'm just curious if there's any \u2013 should we be reading into this at all? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No, Steve. How many times \u2013 never try to outguess me, okay? The reason I had them on is because we made some \u2013 you're something else man. Where's my Tusa Cashmere (45:42)? Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.: Put the bat down, Dave. Put the bat down. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I had committed to you in a session meeting (45:49) we had that I would have Mike come back after six months and talk about the funnel, remember? Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I talked about updating the funnel. So I had Mike, so I wanted Mike to do it live. I could've done it, but I'd rather have Mike do it and you have guys to have a chance to take some cheap shots at Mike. And then if I'm going to have Mike on, I might as well have Bob, so you guys can take some cheap shots at Bob and I know that there's a lot of concern out there about our flow-through profitability and things like that. So there is no call here. Just because Zorro's (46:17) struggling, the CEO is not struggling. I'll still outrun you. But thank you very much for that vote of confidence. These guys are over here dying right now, holding a baseball bat over my head. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I'll reserve the cheap shot for the next CEO. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. Thank you very much, Steve. You're a pal (46:34). Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We're not announcing succession here, Nigel. Don't worry about it, okay? Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I don't know how to follow that, but... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I made it to 2017, I'm going to make it to 2018, okay? Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. I have no doubt about that. I also echo Steve's comments on Zorro (46:55). Very, very sorry about that. But 15 is a hell of an age, so he's had a good run. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: For a King Charles, it's a hell of a run. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So just, obviously, you're not giving FY 2018 guidance here, but any help on framing out V&C for next year just in terms of revenues, underlying margins, restructuring? Any help there would be great. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay, I'll give you. Okay. So I would say that underlying revenues for V&C next year, we're not going to break it out, but it will still be negative. I think that as we prune it and we look at some divestiture in there, I think the core rate will start increasing, but the underlying V&C business probably will be flat at best, maybe slightly down as we continue to prune and we continue to do some things there and sell some parts off. From a profitability standpoint, clearly, what we're trying to do is we're starting at 5% and we've got to figure out how to double that. And the key issue for us is how do we get that? We've got to get back on track the plan that we laid out to the board and our shareholders and make it accretive to us, excluding the accounting charges of the valuation in inventory and backlog and that's the key issue for us. And then, obviously, driving cash flow near-term. I mean there's a lot going on right now, but I like where we are at this point in time. It will hurt us from a margin standpoint, but we're going to figure out how to make sure that we can deliver \u2013 we made a statement on cash flow accretion and slight earnings accretion in 2018 and that's the focus. So that's the framework you're thinking about right now. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right, right. How much restructuring do you think in 2018, Dave? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. I think it's going to be still be around $30 million to $35 million Valves & Controls restructuring. I think you're probably looking at probably the same about for the total or rest of Emerson. So from that perspective, I think you're looking at probably total $60 million to $70 million of restructuring next year. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And then just... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Maybe a tad higher, but yes, that's right. I'm just, yes, that's where I see right now. We're just going through the first phase but that's what we see right now. I think Mike's trying to get $35 million done right off the bat. Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.: We're hustling hard. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We're hustling right now. We have a lot going on. I would say we're going probably do the same amount next year. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then on the funnel, which is a great job, but the $4 billion, (49:21) what kind of hit rate would you expect on that, Dave? I mean, what's been your win rate on projects? And on the $2.5 billion oil and gas, anything to call out in terms of mix of geographies upstream, midstream, subsea? Any help there would be great. Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes, from a geography standpoint, again North America and Europe and some Middle East I think would be the principal places you would expect as far as activities go for sure. From a hit rate standpoint, I mean various kind of product lines. I would argue we've been taking share all through this period right now. And we anticipate this is going reasonably well. Our customers are coming forward with this for the technologies, towards our people, towards our aftermarket capabilities, our service centers. We're doing pretty well holding our own. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We may not get all the projects, but we will get a big chunk of the projects. And so we won't get all the projects. So we've done pretty well here. But I think the key issue for us will be Asia has picked up nicely, it's just a function of I think I said earlier, when the budgets are set at the end of this calendar year, our customers are looking at their cash flow, they're looking at the pricing, and I think we are going to have a pretty good capital spend next year, which will be good for us. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. That's helpful. Thanks, guys. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Take care. Operator : Next question will be from Gautam Khanna with Cowan and Company. Please go ahead. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Hello, Gautam. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Hey. How is it going guys? And I'll echo my sentiments on your dog and that's awful. But yes, a good run. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: He's still alive, but he's hurting. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yes, that's tough, certainly very. I understand. I was wondering if you could quantify the revenues associated with the product exits you've talked about at Valves & Controls. Maybe what they did last year in aggregate? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I'm not going to tell you off the top of my head, but, Mike, do you have an idea? Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.: I don't have it on the top of my head. It's not a huge number, it's pruning. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. Less than $100 million, I mean gut stuff. That's what we're looking at. We're going to pick here and there, and certain things like that. I just know in the short-term that hurts you as you go through that process, and the backlog has been liquidated pretty hard. So... Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.: And they're going to be pruned for a reason which is typically their... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Profitability, yes. Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.: (51:41) Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Got it. Okay. And regarding the cash opportunity at Valves & Controls, do you have an updated view on the timing of when you'll realize that? I think you said $300 million to $400 million in your comments, but previously was it $500 million? I'm just wondering how big is it? And where does it lie within the working capital accounts? And how are you guys going about attacking it? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. So I would say \u2013 I've never said $500 million, I have said $300 million to $400 million. Typically, what we're looking at right now is within 2020 we're looking at trying to get $200 million of that. I would like to see if I can get another $100 million out of that within by 2020. It makes a big difference relative to the payout ratio, our dividend or free cash flow. If you approach $300 million, we get closer to 45% on our payout. And that's ahead of schedule. And that's a big thing for us relative to our dividend or free cash flow payout. And where it sits primarily is inventory, and they have some issues with receivables because of their delivery capabilities just were not up to par versus what we would see, and our customers typically would not pay on time when you haven't delivered. And so those are the two areas we're working on right now. And I would say across all \u2013 it's going to be a Final Control thing we're going after, and that gives us a big chance of getting that $300 million to $400 million well within that by 2020. I mean you'll see it. We're going to have back to back years of free cash flow conversion of over 120%. And there's not many industrial companies that do that. And so I think that we're starting to see the benefit of that, and Mike's team is going to work it hard. And we're really going to push hard because Mike \u2013 Frank and I really want to be able to say that by 2020 we're getting close to 45% of our dividend to free cash flow ratio. That would be a very powerful statement for us to make. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Appreciate the color. Thanks, guys. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're welcome. Take care. Operator : The next question will be from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon. Dave, with the ClosetMaid process winding down there, just wondering if anything else is emerging at the margin of your portfolio? Or if kind of the repositioning and divestiture is more categorically behind you? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: The repositioning that we laid out in June 30 of 2015, the three programs, are behind us when we finish this. As we say we always have little things that we look at. But as we look at the business today, and the two platforms, we're set. And now we want to operate this and so we're moving forward. There's nothing in the works other than the little tiny product lines or plants that we're looking at relative to the Valves & Controls business. So we're set, and we're looking forward to get that behind us. And I know the whole team's working hard on that and it'd be nice to have that done and we can just run forward in 2018. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And Tim (54:46) mentioned the Middle East turning there. That was down a good bit. I'm just wondering, is that a characteristic kind of boom/bust cycle moving into a boom period you think there, with the kind of immature market dynamic in the Middle East? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. I think that \u2013 a couple of things going on. I think there's a little bit more stability from a cash flow standpoint and an earnings standpoint. They've underinvested and so they're \u2013 I mean if we look at our orders right now, the orders are \u2013 Mike has been (55:12) picking up. You have positive... Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.: Picking up. They're shorter cycle orders, but they're picking up. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: They're picking up. So I would say, I think we're going to be next year, that market will be positive growth next year based on what we're seeing right now. I was not as optimistic last call, but now I'm starting to see some good things. Mike's team's done a great job of getting Valves & Controls, include them back into Aramco, back into some Saudi things that we haven't been able to get into before. So a lot of good things are moving our way in the Middle East. I think the only market I see with any heartbeat right now in Latin America is Mexico for us. And Bob's business is a little bit different. He's doing well down there, but Mike's business in the big projects, there's just no money. Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.: NOCs in Latin America are the challenge. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.: And they're just taking their time. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: That's where we sit right now. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then lastly on the $2.60 full year outlook, what's the basis from the third quarter for that? Is it add $0.04 to the $2.63? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I'm trying to understand your logic here. Help me out \u2013 say that one more time and run it by me. I must have Zorro (56:18) syndromes here right now. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yes. So if you look at the $2.60 midpoint for the year, what are we using from the third quarter to bridge to that? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Oh. Unknown Speaker : $0.67. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: $0.68? Unknown Speaker : Well $0.68 is \u2013 excludes a penny of ops and our full guide has the full nickel of ops in it so you want to use... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: $0.67. Thank you very much. That's a very good question. Next? Operator : All right. Our next question will be from Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Please go ahead. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good afternoon, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Rob. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I guess the first question is, in looking at kind of this recovery we're seeing I suppose, how do we think about if we go into another oil and gas swoon here? Or how should we be thinking about it? Because we got the crosscurrents of underinvestment, pent-up demand, the turnarounds, but you could be in a situation where you could see material pull back here. So how do we think about kind of scenario analysis for 2018 if we start to see a swoon again? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean, I haven't really mapped it out, but if you start seeing also in the price of oil drop back below $30, $20 you'd see immediately our business, Mike's business go negative, and within the next couple of quarters it would be negative and so we'll be back into slight negative overall for the business. I don't see that happening at this point in time because the global marketplace is growing. The use of oil has gone up. I think the price of oil has stabilized, but there is that likelihood, but we don't see that in our customer behavior not do we see that in the marketplaces, but it would clearly set us back from a growth standpoint and then we clearly would have to curtail any type of investments and look at profitability and clearly look at what we have to do (58:22) V&C. But I would say that's a low probability for 2018 at this point in time. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: In terms of V&C now that it's closed and you have it under the hood a little bit, what do you think is the good and the bad and the ugly there in terms of your initial expectations? What would you kind of highlight as being the most positive surprise, the most negative surprise in terms of the acquisition? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think the one positive \u2013 the negative that the business had deteriorated in profitability a little bit more than we wanted to, so our delta where we're (58:54) coming from is a bigger leap the first year and I'm telling my guys that's what it is. We've got to figure out how to get that earnings up for 2018. That would be the worst. But at the same time on the positive side, I think the people across V&C are truly engaged and they're looking forward to working very, very hard with the Automation business, which is very global, very broad and one that can get into customer accounts and get things done. We also have the resources, the financial resources, the cash flow resources to invest in this business and so that's a good thing. So overall, Ed Monsigate (59:30) report with Mike today and Rahm (59:33) was involved in the business. Things are actually better overall \u2013 there's always some things underneath there but better overall than we thought, and we're looking forward to a very positive 2018, 2019. Just coming off a lower base, and we are where we are, and the cash flow will come out. The cash flow is there. We'll get that cash. We know how to get it up the balance sheet. Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. I would say very good bones. We like what the business looks like. Very good team members; really, really, really know their business. I think with the way we're propositioning moving their operating methods towards our methods, I think they're very excited about it, and we're working our way through it, and I think it will be very effective going forward. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you, Rob. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Go ahead. You got one more. You got one more question. Go ahead. We'll give you one more question. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I didn't want to be a mooch, but we'll get Bob involved. Unknown Speaker : (1:00:22) David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: (1:00:25) you still work for Stifel, don't you? You're a mooch. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Stifler's mom. Get it right. In any event, for Bob, maybe you could talk about just \u2013 do you feel good about the state of your business overall with respect to Copeland Compressors position? And, I mean, obviously, you've been incredibly strong market share there, great technology position, but do you think there's going to be a level of investment or a level of defense of the technology or share over there over the next three to four years? Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.: We feel good about Scroll. It's been a very strong run for literally decades now, and it's still got plenty of legs. The UltraTech has still got a lot of opportunity. As we said in the U.S. residential market, we think that's the solution on efficiency and comfort. And the Commercial side, we've got some new products in the kind of 10 to 20 horsepower area that are very competitive, and doing very well right now. And then, there's certainly some of the bigger-size stuff we put things together in tandem and trios and things like that. So, yes, there's \u2013 we like that range that Scroll plays within. It continues to push higher, and it's in commercial applications that are very helpful, and then combined with the solutions capability. We feel good about the prospects there. Like I said, there are other people calling the variable speed market in the U.S. not long ago, and now you see again in that middle tier customers explicitly showing that they're using Copeland Scrolls, and they got some very important sign of what's going on. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think the key issue here, Rob, is that the investments that we've been making for many, many years here both from the technologies around the Scrolls, the products around Scrolls, around the capabilities and solutions are really starting to pay off on a global basis. And so, the work that was done in Asia and China around some of these packages and we have a lot more we can do there. Same thing in Europe. Same thing in the United States. So Bob and his team have had a good couple of wins going to his back right now, which helps him a lot. And I think that several more of those solutions we'll be hitting later this year or early next year. So I think that our solutions approach here is not just a product focus. It's really starting to pay off, and we'll continue to invest around that. I'm very optimistic. The goal for Bob is to have a premium growth, like Mike has done in the Automation business for years. And if he can do that at the level of profitability he has, that's a big winner for Emerson and Emerson shareholders. Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.: It's hard to find a more competitive market than China right now. And this compressor of choice in the heat pump market is a Scrolls compressor from us. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your time. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Take care, Rob. All the best to you and thanks very much for your support and comments on Zorro (1:03:21). I appreciate that. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: That's it. And so what I'd like to say is goodbye. I want to thank everybody across the organization. And, again, thank you very much for your support on our organization. We still got a couple of months left, folks. We got to make this happen. And I want to thank our shareholders for their support and look forward to seeing everybody in the near future. And, again, I look forward to wrap up the year as we get into November. Thank you very much. All the best. Operator : The conference's now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Emerson's Investor Conference Call. During today's presentation by Emerson's management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. This conference is being recorded today, November 7, 2017. Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today is available on Emerson's most recent Annual Report and on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Tim Reeves, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead, sir. [0GL7XZ-E Tim Reeves]: Thank you, Keith. I'm joined today by David Farr, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. I will start with the fiscal year summary, as shown on page three of the slide presentation. We had a strong second half and finish to 2017 as demand strengthened in key served markets and economic conditions improved in most world areas. Our full year results exceeded growth and EPS targets communicated at our Investor Conference, and exceeded the updated EPS guidance provided on our Q3 earnings call. Underlying sales growth was 1% in the year. Reported sales grew 5% to $15.3 billion, including the results of the Valves & Controls acquisition, which closed on April 28. Profitability in the base business, excluding Valves & Controls, was solid. EBIT margin expanding 70 basis points to 17.9%. Adjusted earnings per share increased 8% to $2.64, excluding $0.10 of Valves & Controls first year acquisition accounting charges. Finally, solid earnings in trade working capital performance resulted in strong operating cash flow generation of 8%, and free cash flow of $2.2 billion, reflecting 130% conversion of net income and a new high for Emerson's 14.5% of sales. In 2017, we completed our 61st year of consecutive dividend increases and returns $1.6 billion of cash to shareholders. We closed out the year with September trailing three months underlying orders up 11%. We're encouraged by the continued strength in orders and note that these trends are consistent with expectations communicated at the Electrical Products Group Industry Conference in May when we laid out our top line expectations for fiscal 2018. Turning to slide 4. In the fourth quarter, demand remained favorable across both platforms, and the company delivered 3% underlying growth. Reported sales grew 13% to $4.4 billion, including the results of the Valves & Controls acquisitions. Sales were negatively affected by the hurricanes that hit Texas and Florida, and we expect to recover these sales over the next 12 months. Adjusted earnings per share was up 12% at $0.83, which includes Valves & Controls operations, but excludes $0.06 of first year acquisition accounting charges. Turning to slide five. Profitability in the quarter was affected by the Valves & Controls acquisition, excluding both the first year acquisition accounting charges as well as dilution from operations. Gross margin was down 40 basis points to 43.2%. This decrease was driven by the declining ClosetMaid business, which was divested early in October, and by unfavorable mix as disruption resulting from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. EBIT margin increased 130 basis points to 19.7%, driven by the benefit of restructuring investments and lower restructuring spend in the quarter. Turning now to slide 6. In the first half of fiscal 2017, underlying sales were down 1%, with strong demand in many commercial & residential solutions end markets, offset by slower global automation investment. Industrial business spending began to pick up in the second quarter as oil and gas prices stabilized and global economic conditions began to trend favorably. Full year 2017 underlying sales were up 1%, with reported sales up 5%. In the fourth quarter, we saw a continued strength in most world areas, with emerging markets up slightly and mature markets up mid-single-digits. Growth was led by North America, including robust growth in Canada and, Asia, where sales in China continued to be very strong and began to run up against tougher prior year comparisons. Outside of China, the rest of Asia grew low-single-digits in the second half, a reversal of first half performance, supported by improving demand in automation end markets. Middle East and Africa region was down in the year and in the quarter, but orders here have turned positive. And turning now to slide 7. Total segment margins, excluding Valves & Controls, improved 150 basis points to 21.5%, driven by the benefits of restructuring actions, lower restructuring spend and leverage on higher volume. Corporate and other charges increased $57 million, due to $56 million of Valves & Controls first year acquisition accounting charges. $44 million of this total related to inventory revaluation, which is charged to cost of goods sold, and $12 million is related to backlog amortization, which is charged to other deductions. We increased capital spending in the quarter 21% to $176 million, reflecting our more positive outlook on the global business environment. Trade working capital, excluding Valves & Controls, improved 90 basis points to 14.4% during the quarter, driven by execution around inventory management and accounts receivable collections. Turning to slide 8, Automation Solutions. September three-month underlying orders were up 15%, supported by energy-related life sciences and chemical markets, with KOB 3 demand continuing strong through the quarter and an increasing mix of KOB 2 small and mid-sized projects focused on expansion, upgrades, and optimization of existing facilities. Our underlying sales grew 3% in the quarter, and net sales grew 18% to $2.9 billion, including results from the Valves & Controls acquisition. Underlying sales growth of 10% in North America was supported by continued investment by shale customers, midstream upgrade and automation investments, and strong growth in Canada, reflecting a recovery in unconventional oil and gas investments. The Control Systems and Solutions business returned to growth in the quarter, reflecting investments in small and mid-sized system projects. Latin America remained down and has not yet begun to recover. Middle East and Africa was down but underlying sales \u2013 underlying orders here have turned positive. Our funnel for tracking large projects continues to grow, and we expect to have better visibility on timing of these projects in the first calendar quarter of 2018 as our customized \u2013 as our customers finalize capital budget plans for the year. Margin, excluding Valves & Controls, improved 300 basis points to 20.2%, reflecting the flow-through of benefits from restructuring actions, lower restructuring spend, and leverage on higher sales. In 2018, we expect strong KOB 3, an increasing mix of KOB 2 projects to drive 5% to 7% underlying growth. Turning now to slide 9, Commercial & Residential solutions. September three-month underlying orders were up 5%, led by broad-based demand in Asia, as well as continued strength in professional tools in oil and gas and construction-related markets. Sales increased 4%, with underlying sales of 3%. North America underlying sales were down 1% due to cooler summer temperatures and the impact of hurricane disruption during the quarter. Growth of 14% in Asia was led by China air conditioning and refrigeration markets. Excluding China, the rest of the region was up high-single-digits in the quarter. Margin declined 110 basis points to 23.5%, excluding the divested ClosetMaid business, margin was 24.7% and declined 60 basis points when compared with the prior year on the same basis. The decline was driven mainly by mix as cooler weather and disruption from hurricanes slowed higher-margin compressor replacement business. In 2018, we expect continued favorable end markets to drive underlying sales growth of 3% to 5%. Let's turn now to slide 10 and walk through our 2018 outlook. With an improving global economic picture and momentum in our key served markets, we expect underlying sales growth of 4% to 6% next year, with Automation Solutions underlying sales of 5% to 7%, and Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales of 3% to 5%. Our operating cash flow target is $2.8 billion, and we expect to convert free cash flow at over 100% of net income, in part by leveraging the working capital opportunity we see at Valves & Controls. Our adjusted EPS guidance is $2.75 to $2.95, or growth of 4% to 12%. Adjusted EPS excludes two items, $0.03 of Valves & Controls first year acquisition accounting charges related to inventory and backlog amortization; and $0.06 tax-related loss on the divestiture of the ClosetMaid business, which closed early in the first quarter and will drive a Q1 tax rate of approximately 40%. We expect Valves & Controls operations will be slightly accretive in 2018 including charges for our intangibles amortization and anticipated restructuring spend. And now, I will turn the call over to Mr. David Farr. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much, Tim. Welcome, everybody. And before I get into some other slides, I want to share \u2013 first of all, I want to thank all the people across Emerson after delivering a very strong year, outstanding year, strong growth at the top-line, strong order growth, as you saw in the second half of the year, very good performance relative to profitability in the margins, outstanding cash flow with our cash flow \u2013 the dividend \u2013 free cash flow to dividend ratio only being at 56%, which we, a year ago, we thought would be around 62%, so very good performance. From my perspective, the people across this company rose to the challenge that we put on their back as we went through the repositioning effort, as we moved into early parts of fiscal 2017 and I'm extremely proud of it. As I look at where we see 2018 at this point in time, I see orders continuing to be at high levels. I will share a chart with you in a few minutes, saying that the preliminary October looked at 12% underlying growth for the total corporation, with Automation at 15% and Commercial Residential at 7%. As I've also said to everybody over the last six months, as we've seen our order pace pick back up, particularly around the Automation Solutions, I want to make sure we understand the mix of this as we go through the last three months of this fiscal year, as we move into the January, February time period for a couple of reasons. One, our KOB 3, which is day-to-day MRO improvement of the facilities has been strong and continues to be the same pace. We're starting to see some of the KOB 2, which is smaller minor upgrades and our backlog is starting to build, our backlog built in the fourth quarter versus last year. We expect that to continue to happen. I want to make sure we see a steady pace as we continue to see our orders pace stay strong and also our backlog builds and we see that mix of business as we see our customer base start telling us what their capital budgets are going to be. As you know, our capital budget for next year's going to be up nearly 15%. We're talking and planning to be from about $480 million to $550 million in capital, so we are investing in the company. And if you look at the tax reform bill right now, there's a lot of focus on encouraging people to spend capital. So from my perspective right now, we're trying to be very careful relative to the pace of business, relative to our sales forecast. We have not changed the sales forecast, what I've been communicating now for several months, with the underlying growth rate of the total corporation in the 4% to 6% range; Automation Solutions in the 5% to 7% range; and Commercial Residential in the 3% to 5% range. I'll say it again, I want to see the pace of the orders over the next three to four months, I will then, at that point in time, upgrade the forecast and expectations that we see in our base business. Clearly, the momentum is on our side right now, the order pattern is consistently stayed within that band and now, as I said, we from time-to-time will go at the high end of that band which we did in September, and we are there in October. I'd expect us to see some pretty good pace along those lines. From a standpoint of the cash flow and profitability, we will continue to have very good profitability in the base business. Looking at decent conversion across this company, in the 30s on a combined basis, as we look at the two businesses, again, I will refine that as I look at the mix of business and as we go forward, that makes a big difference. Clearly right now, as the KOB 3 stays strong, KOB 2 starts coming in, profitability should be reasonable in the business. If we move towards that 7% type underlying growth rate automation or even better, then we're going to have start investing and to handle this growth in the top of business, so we'll be looking at all those trade-offs as we go forward. Right now, I feel good about where we sit at this point in time. Backlog building, orders good, world areas are all kicking in except for Latin America at this point in time. Commercial Residential is running at extremely high levels at this point in time. Order pace still is good. Clearly, we have an issue relative to North America with the three hurricanes and also the bad earthquake down in Mexico. I fundamentally believe we'll work through that and that will be a positive for us. But again, we need to see what happens here as move into that season and they start replacing some of those units. But profitability, again, at Commercial Residential is pretty good. We are upping our restructuring in the Commercial Residential next year and some capital spending as we get ready for repositioning for capital, or for capacity, and also as we look at further consolidation across the Commercial Residential under Bob Sharp and Jim Lindemann effort, and they're making great progress as you can see in the profitability and the cash flow. Cash flow, I think, will be north of $2.8 billion. We put a number out there, $2.8 billion. I fundamentally believe that we'll be north of that. I also fundamentally believe our free cash flow will be conversion of around 120% to 125%. Again, those are different numbers than we put in the press release. This is where I feel we are at this point in time. We have a lot of momentum within the process of integration of Valves & Controls. And for your information, and I'll share a chart with you in a few minutes, Valves & Controls orders for the month of October three month were all \u2013 (16:27) went positive. So we've been telling you that we felt they go positive, they went positive. And they went positive, as we continue to see the momentum across the organizations, as we share the synergies across our selling organization, our key accounts and we're getting into accounts that we never been in before and we're actually able to really start to really take advantage of the global network that we have in Automation Solutions, and Valves & Controls are now starting to see that momentum. We're seeing great momentum of improving their on-time delivery. We're seeing momentum relative to the asset management. You already saw some of that in the fourth quarter in the cash flow that came through. Again, I want to commend the whole organization around Automation Solutions, including a lot of help here at the corporate headquarters as they work through cash and we're starting to see that cash come through and I think we'll see that go forward throughout all 2018. Feel very good about that and from where we sit at this point in time. So, net-net, I fundamentally believe that the wind shifted. We have a couple of things we have to overcome. We'll give you a lot more details at our Investor Day in February, as we always do. But I'm giving you more insights to what we see at this point in time than we historically would in November. We clearly have a couple of things we have to overcome, one of them being when we made the restructuring in Brazil last year in the first quarter, we got a tax benefit. It was the right thing to do as we repositioned our Brazilian organization for what we saw going on in Brazil. We got a tax benefit. We have to overcome that in the full year. We will do that and, obviously, really challenges us in the first quarter. We also have lost the profitability from the business of ClosetMaid, which we did divest. And I'm glad we did divest. We've got that behind us and we, obviously, had to take a hit in the quarter as we booked that situation. So fundamentally, I feel good about where we sit. So if you look at the chart 11 here and talk about as I look at where we are relative to what \u2013 the journey that we started back in 2015, when we announced in June 30, 2015 to reposition the company, which is a healthy process. We've built a very strong company. We looked out. We said, look we need to reposition this company and focus on two fundamental platforms, which we've done. We repositioned, got that done. As we moved into 2017, we talked about growth. We talked about improved profitability. We talked about improved earnings. We talked about improved cash flow. And I fundamentally believe that we have moved through that phase in very strongly, and now we're moving into the next phase where people talk, hear me talk about getting back into a level of profitability to drive earnings per share in that $3.25 to $3.50 range as we talked about, I publicly talked about that around the 2020 range \u2013 in 2020. I've also talked about trying to get back to the cash flow levels in that $3.3 billion level, which would get us below the free cash flow to dividend ratios of the low 50% into the high-40s. Again, very important relative to where we try to go. We have a very strong company this point in time. We have a very strong organization. We continue to do bolt-on acquisitions. And clearly, we'll talk about what we see going on with Rockwell in a few minutes, but that's not what I'm talking about now. I'm talking about the core company that continues to do very well and continues to create value and grow and have a great future as we move into that next phase of accelerating growth, accelerating growth in earnings and sales and also cash flow. So if you look at 2012 \u2013 page 12, and you look at the leverage across the portfolio, if you think about the Commercial Residential Solutions business, we built this Commercial Residential business over time through strategic acquisitions, in fact, I worked on the Copeland acquisition as a very young planning expert in acquisitions back in the 1996 time period. We've gone forth and we've invested in technologies that have a lot of internal growth. We've made strategic acquisitions. We've repositioned this from a pure component type of play to more of a solutions play. And under Bob's leadership, Bob Sharp's leadership right now, he continues to make investments in that next-generation of not only technology, but the solutions on a global basis that really drive the fundamental standards we need across this world relative to energy efficiency, refrigerants, and basically stewards of this industry, and we are a major player. And we'll continue to make acquisitions relative to the technologies, relative to software as we continue to move up in this pyramid of solution. And you'll continue to see more of what we're trying to do, we actually talked about one with the board today relative to commercial solutions area and talking about that next-generation technology around control and around communications. But very successful program of both internally development, investments, acquisitions, integration and creating us a very broad global solutions play around the Commercial Residential business and very strong Commercial Residential business today, running around $6 billion in size, with margins in and close to 24%, 24.5%, very strong business from that perspective. If you look at chart 13, Automation Solutions. As you all know, I ran this business many, many years ago. I've been involved in doing acquisitions in this business. I've been involved in creating the whole process integration, including introducing Plantweb and the first control in the field products back in the mid to late 1990s, involved in making strategic acquisitions around the Westinghouse innovation, around buying companies like Daniel, buying companies around the various technologies, and so we built a very strong business from the sensors, the instruments, from the control, all the way up to data management, with the most recent acquisitions very much in the data management area. We build a very strong portfolio of technology, product leadership, solutions capabilities on a very global basis. If you look at our marketplace today, we're fundamentally a leader in all the global marketplaces that we serve today, be it Europe, be it Asia Pacific, be it Latin America, be it United States on a very broad automation solutions capability around the process, we've got a very strong capability, very much built on a technology at the same time supplementing that with acquisitions and expectations of being able to do more in that area. The final \u2013 the Valves & Controls acquisition we just recently did was a very strategic acquisition for us relative to bringing more capabilities, relative to bring a stronger solutions package for our customer and the integration's going well. We will continue to grow this business and we'll continue to improve the profitability and the cash flow of the business. And to-date, I feel very good of where we are and I fundamentally believe, as we close out the year, my hats off to Terry Buzbee, to Mike Train, and to Rob (sic) [Bob] Karschnia about the tremendous progress they've made in a very short time period. But clearly, they got a lot to get done in 2018, but the wind has definitely shifted at they're back. But we really have built this strong foundation on core investments, acquisitions, going from all the way back in the 1970s, all the way up here to now to the 2017 and we'll continue to do that, so I'm very pleased with that. If you look at how we created integrated solutions, Plantweb was something that I introduced as the leader of process. Many of you might remember, we had buses down in Houston ran around with Plantweb signs on kind of funky oranges and lime greens and bringing out the technology to Plantweb the first type of control in the field, the first industrial Internet of thing within the industry. So we've been continuing to build from a foundation of products, the technologies, integrated solutions to problem solving to now the top quartile performance. We have been \u2013 our business is all about changing and creating capabilities for our customers. And at the same time, helping our customers succeed, which allowed us to succeed, and we have continue to grow and prosper, and we've become \u2013 gone from a minor player in this industry to world's number one player in the process automation business. The time period that I've been involved with is going back into the mid-1990s to now 2018. As you can see from the participation standpoint, we have continued to grow the business. We've continue to add in both acquisitions and penetration in market. We go through periods in this business, yes it goes up, yes it goes down. We just gone through a down-cycle, it's now starting to turn around. As we look at it right now, this market is now growing. We are continuing to execute along that. We have a lot of new products, which is our core mantra within this industry. What we try to do is bring new products, new technologies out right when that market turns and the market starting to turn and we feel good about this marketplace. As we look at our automation business today as we move towards being $11 billion automation business in 2018. And so we have a lot of opportunities here. I think we have continued capabilities of outperforming the market, continue to have opportunities through acquisitions, and we'll have continued capability of creating a very broad global solutions, at the same time, investing at levels that they are very significant compared to competitors in technology and innovation and setting the industry standards that we need to set to help our customers be stronger and more competitive. If you go to chart 15, it's a chart that I actually showed back the first time in February 2016 in Austin, Texas. Showed it again last year, our fundamental discussion around be an automation business, be an automation marketplace, a very strong statement about we want to focus first going up that process, we're already in the hybrid marketplace, we're already in the discrete marketplace, but also move both up and across. The Pentair Valves & Controls clearly puts us down \u2013 coming down stronger in the process world. The Paradigm puts us stronger in the process world in the operations management and consulting world. We have made investments and we'll continue to make investments over in the hybrid market and discrete market place. This is a strategy that we've been talking about. This is not a new strategy. We've been communicating this. I've been showing this chart to the outside world now for over two years and we'll continue to show this because this is a focus for us. And with or without Rockwell, we are very strong company and we will continue to make acquisitions within this space. We'll continue to grow in this space and be a player. Our goals and our stated goal is to be a strong global automation supplier to this industry. And we'll continue to focus on that, and we'll continue to make the necessary investments internally and through acquisitions to make that happen. It has been a stated goal ever since our whole repositioning efforts has started from that day and going forward. If you look at chart 16, the orders chart I talked about, you can see the map we laid out, the Electrical Products Group in May. We stayed pretty well within that band. And in September, we were at the high-end of it. October, I just said preliminary right now we're looking at 12% right at the tip of that. I expect us to continue to do well here in the next couple of months. But again I want to reiterate, I've been saying this now three or four months, five months, I want to see the pace of business, I want to see the mix of this business, I want to see the cut to the capital allocation coming from our customer base, that will tell me a lot about what is the momentum, what's the pace of this recovery. Is this recovery a 7%, 8% recovery, is this recovery a 8%, 9%, 10% recovery, what is this? I fundamentally believe the recovery is going to spread out over two years. I think the recovery is going to be spread out over 2018 and 2019. But then, again, I don't control the recovery, the recovery is controlled by the market and what our customers have to spend. The pace right now is very good. The order pace is very good. The comparisons will obviously get tougher, but we clearly have a lot of momentum on a global basis and it's not just one or two key markets as we started out earlier this year. Our backlog has continued to build. We're still not back to the September level as you see, excluding the Valves & Controls. But I fundamentally believe that our backlog will continue. We are actually seeing very strong, what I call, KOB 2. These are minor expansions and upgrades. And not just the KOB 3 type of projects. The order pace that we started seeing in the last couple of months, I've seen that go up. It's one of the reasons our order pace is bumped up. I want to see the mix of that; I want to see where it's going to come from. But fundamentally, I like where we are right now, though the momentum is quite strong. Our new products are coming out very nicely and we are winning in the marketplace at this point in time. If you go to chart 17, this is a chart that we're showing you the Final Control numbers, which is the \u2013 that's what we call the Fisher and all the other actuation put together, the Final Control business that Terry \u2013 that now Ram heads up, he's the Group President. Terry Buzbee, now Ram. You can see the recovery has really taken off in that business. We've had strong momentum. Our estimated numbers are sitting there close to 20% in October. You could see, on a pro forma basis, together the numbers are around that 10% range and you can see that Valves & Controls actually have gone positive. And we see that momentum continue to build and we like where we sit at this point in time. But the partnerships, the main valve partnerships, the broader market exposure, those are all happening. New key accounts, the areas that we thought that we could see happening are happening and I have a lot of expectations as the market recovers that we'll continue to move this forward. We will improve the profitability; we will improve the cash management. You know Emerson can deliver on cash. We set a record this year of 14.5% of cash flow to sales, and it's a very good level. I mean there's couple of us in the industry that can do that. And \u2013 but it's a rare breed and we will have another good year in 2018. Clearly, the faster they grow the more cash we'll have to invest. But at the same time we'll also generate a little bit higher levels of profitability. So before we \u2013 I move to questions, and I know you may have one or two questions, but just before I move to questions, let me address the proposal we made to rock Rockwell Automation to combine our two companies. Emerson, you know, has successfully repositioned its portfolio over the last two years. I just talked about it. We've gone through phase one and phase two. We have two very strong platforms, Automation Solutions under Mike Train's leadership. The Commercial Residential Solutions under Bob Sharp's leadership. I like what I see with these two businesses. They're finding opportunities for growth, for profitability, that we had not seen before as we really focus hard on these two platforms. Both are performing extremely well right now and have very attractive growth outlooks. As you just heard, I think that the underlying growth for the next couple of years going to look pretty good, and it's a function of what we see around the world. But I still like what we see. And most importantly, we have a situation going on in Washington right now, potentially, that could really accelerate investments and capital formation which will help a company like Emerson. It was from this position of strength and our two platform focus and with confidence \u2013 strong confidence in our future that we attempted to gauge with Rockwell for the long-term global opportunities, for stronger growth and stronger profitability between our two businesses. In early August, we made a private proposal to Rockwell's board that valued the company to $200 per share in cash and stock, a significant premium to its unaffected market valuation at that point time. After that, proposal rejected, we followed up with a second proposal in early October for $215 per share in cash and stock which is a full and fair price based on public data information that we see today. The proposal will allow Rockwell and Emerson shareholders to benefit meaningfully from the superior growth in earnings, we believe, the combined company would achieve over the longer term. Rockwell is a premier high performing well-run company with strong management, strong innovation, and employee base who we believe share our values and culture of execution and exceptional profitability. Very good company, a company we've always looked up to and really appreciated what they've done in the industry. Both companies provide engineering focused solutions and are leading the way on digitalization in our respective markets. We're market leaders in the end markets we play in today. We continue to believe the combination of Emerson and Rockwell is compelling and highly strategic for the global automation markets for our customer base and for driving future technology for our customers for a long time. By leveraging the key technology platforms that are strengths of Emerson and Rockwell where these technology can mutually coexist and thrive. We would create an industry leader, better positioned in an environment where the global customer base is asking for a more integrated solution in the process world, in the hybrid world. The industrial logic behind this combination is very clear, in my mind and the board's mind. And the result would be a diversified company that's well-positioned to compete and thrive over the long-term and create value for our customers, our employees, and our shareholders. Rockwell's management has for many years described to its shareholders the importance of process automation for future growth. Emerson has the scale and the best-in-class process automation Rockwell has been trying to build for many, many years. And we provide an immediate solution for this need with our number one global installed base and global position in solutions, service, and organization. As our industry continues to consolidate to meet customer demand, we believe the opportunity to combine Emerson and Rockwell now is a timely, unique, and attractive proposition for both sets of customers, shareholders, and employees. Looking across our competitive set, no two companies are a more logical fit than Emerson and Rockwell or provide a clear path to strengthen customer relationships and generate enhanced revenue and earnings growth for many years to come. We are hopeful that Rockwell's board and management team will engage with us for the benefit of all stakeholders. But while we will be disappointed if Rockwell lets this unique opportunity go unexplored, we will remain disciplined in respect to price and we have a very viable strategic plan in place that we are highly confident as a company, as a leadership, and as a board as you've heard me discuss today and numerous times over the last 12 months. We will not extend this proposal indefinitely without a clear signal that Rockwell and its shareholders are open to a mutual beneficial transaction. We'll continue to work with our advisors, JPMorgan, Centerview, and Davis Polk to find a way forward with this opportunity. However, Emerson is very healthy and prosperous company and we're very focused in succeeding with or without Rockwell. That is all I'll have to say about Rockwell today. As I \u2013 and I'm sure you can appreciate, will be not taking questions on any acquisition proposal. With that, I'll open the call to questions about the earnings results. A very strong close in fiscal 2017 and a look at 2018. I appreciate you understanding and honoring that because you will get \u2013 I cannot talk about it if you ask me. So thank you very much and I look forward to the Q&A section from our shareholders at this point in time. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Scott. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : I'm dying to ask about Rockwell, but I'm not going to because you... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You can ask me and I'll give those statements, if you want to just ask me, and I'll say, you know. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : I've got very thin skin, so. Anyway the question I want to ask this is. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You start your own company, it's because you got thin skin. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Just today, only today. If I got the stock right once in a while, my skin would get a little thicker, but anyways. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You can't get everything right, Scott, come on. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : I'm going to ask a roundabout question that isn't exactly Rockwell, but \u2013 and it's more about size of deals. And if you think in terms of, you've about bolt-on acquisitions and, even in hindsight, Pentair Valves business wasn't really all that big in the grand scheme of things. But are we to maybe take away from the Rockwell gig that you are comfortable putting together or putting out or looking at bigger stuff? And does it have to be automation? I mean, is there \u2013 would you invest in \u2013 I mean discrete automation, say. Would you invest in other kind of automation assets to get you to this maybe not the same exact place, but get you to a place that's a little bit different from where you're at right now in discrete? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. I think that, from our perspective, as I communicated using that slide relative to the process automation and hybrid space, we are willing to explore significant acquisitions we've said it over the years in to expand that business presence around the hybrid space, around the discreet area. As we've gone through this whole repositioning effort, Scott, our focus is highly focused on automation as we define automation today in the Commercial Residential. At this point in time, I think we have big opportunities, both small, medium, and larger opportunities. Clearly, with this type of transaction, move like we did with Rockwell it's a very compelling strategic fit between our two companies. I fundamentally believe organization today can digest larger strategic deals, but they have to be within these two spaces. We are very focused at this point in time. We think there's unique opportunities there and we'll continue to play that. But from my standpoint, we move on after a certain point in time. We start looking at other opportunities which we have in our plate within the automation, but don't look for me and this management team and this board at this point in time to move outside these two spaces, these two platforms. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Okay, fair enough. And then just as a follow-on, I mean you talked about taking CapEx up 15% next year and oftentimes what we see is when CapEx goes up, kind of core expenses go up. I mean, do your operating expenses need to come up which is kind of a backdoor way of saying, are we going to see a full operating leverage in 2018 before \u2013 I mean, you mentioned after debt (39:20) cost back eventually, but I'm more particularly interested in that next 12 months or so? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: From my perspective, where we are in this curve I'm interested in having appropriate leverage which means we've got to have a three in front of us. And... Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Okay. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: And the reason \u2013 yes, as you spend capital, now we've been planning and systemically stepping into the capital and I think we can manage that from the standpoint, as you know we don't really cut capital real deep nor do we go crazy on the upside, we just have a couple of larger projects that will be some big capital numbers which is, so it's not a lot of them, there's like three or four major capital spending projects, that we have a big chunk of that. So we could easily handle that and still have good leverage. The key thing for me is I've been communicating outside as I've watched the Automated Solutions orders which have continued to do well double-digit. From my standpoint as I see that mix of biz happening, we start seeing growth rates of the first five then six then seven and seven-plus or eight then that's where we're going to have start triggering the investments that we need to support our customers on a global basis. So I think in the early stages, we want to see the appropriate leverage. And then, over time, we're going to have to take some of that leverage and invest it. But as we get into 2018, my sign is I want to have the appropriate leverage and the key thing for me right now is see the whites of the eyes of the growth rate, the top line. And what that means I want to see the Automation business going to the high-end of the range we gave you. I want to see Commercial Residential business moving towards that 5% which I think they can. And then we'll start saying, okay guys, how do we invest and maybe get a little bit more growth? But that's I'm in the period right now that I want to see it. I want to, if you've ever surfed, I'm going to ride at the front of the wave for a while here as we have been riding in the last six months. I do not want to ride behind the wave which means I would not have appropriate leverage. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : That's very clear. Thank you, Dave, and good luck with all the stuff. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much, Scott. And good luck with your company, too, by the way. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Steven Winoker with UBS. Steven Eric Winoker - UBS: Thanks. Good morning, Dave and all. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good morning, Stevie. Are you free to talk now with your new firm, huh? Steven Eric Winoker - UBS: Well, well, no views or opinions just questions still. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. Steven Eric Winoker - UBS: So, Dave, I don't want to dive into Rockwell either than that Scott said but there's a question without Rockwell. If Rockwell does not happen as you've talked about in the past, what's your ability to either partner or just organically do something that's been so difficult to build on the discrete side and the hybrid side, can you make something work internally within internal organic investment and the right partnership that actually make a dent in that market? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think there are ways to do it outside a strategic fit like with Rockwell. There are ways to do it. There are through acquisitions and there are through joint ventures and partnerships. There are ways to do it. As we've looked at the process side as we continue to invest in the hybrid side, we know that in order for us to be successful in a good time period, we're going to have to do that. And so, that's why the focus is really picking up and we have opportunities, we talk opportunities again with the board today. And so I think that you'll see us that we'll be pushing there. It clearly is a more building approach versus a very large one strategic move at one time but there are opportunities there and we have, as you can see, the return of sales growth and the probability and cash flow is allowing us to do to be go out and find these opportunities for us for the future. So I think we're in a good position right now. And I think the opportunities are out there and people see that we are very, very focused and very true to be a global automation house. Our customers see this and our competitors see this. And so I think that we're well-positioned to do more even outside if something didn't happen to Rockwell. Steven Eric Winoker - UBS: And that product as well as installed base in technology? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes, it is. It's across the board. I mean obviously, from the standpoint of, just in the hybrid and the discrete side, we need clearly some different channels, we need some different technologies and that's why you have to do the acquisitions or ventures. But I think we have the capability to do it internally, but I think to get there faster and get there on a timely manner and do it right for our customers, we will \u2013 most likely we'll have to do the right type of acquisitions or right type of joint ventures. Steven Eric Winoker - UBS: Okay, great. And then you talked about this recovery potentially being more of a two-year recovery and some of the things that you're waiting to see. How much of what you're seeing is sort of MRO catch up versus new capacity, upgraded capacity in the initial discussion? And when you think about that GFI growth that you normally talk about the kind of acceleration once you hit 4% or GFI hits 4%. How should we think about it in that context because it feels like we're right in the middle or right at the beginning of all this happening? So some perspective on that one... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We are definitely beginning to see and so what we're seeing right now as we look at the order pace and our sales pace over the last six months or seven months with Automation Solutions, it's heavily what we called the KOB 3 the service MRO type of base, what our customer base have had to reinvest and to improve their efficiencies, improve their quality, to improve their obviously safety. And we're now starting to see what we called the KOB 2 side where they're doing \u2013 starting to do some minor expansions. We fundamentally believe this recovery in the initial phases will be heavy on the KOB 3 and KOB 2 throughout all of 2018. And what I'm trying to watch right now is the pace of the KOB 3 is pretty steady at this point in time, will accelerate a little bit more if there's more capital being allocated in the January, February, March budgets of our customer base. If that's the case and you're going to see more short-term investments, which will be good for us. And then we'll start to see in the KOB 2 minor expansions, which also help us late in 2018 and early in 2019. I fundamentally don't believe the bigger projects will start happening to us. We're bidding on them right now, but they will not really start happening until late 2018 early 2019. But the pace of the recovery is pretty much similar to what we see in the past, except we have a customer base that I think are being a little bit more cautious. Now with the price of commodities, all sorts of commodities firming and go in the right way, we might see some acceleration. I also see my customer base getting more healthy from a cash flow standpoint. And so those are all good signs. So I'm encouraged that we're going to see improve capital and reallocation towards the type of spending that we see in automation, which will be good for companies like us. Steven Eric Winoker - UBS: Okay. I'll pass it on. Thanks, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much, Steven. Welcome back. Steven Eric Winoker - UBS: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Chris. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hey, I was wondering the Valves & Controls margin outlook, it looks like you had a little bit of negative EBIT in the second half of 2017 there. Do you think 5% is a good level for next year or kind of work and back to that by the second half of 2018 maybe? Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: No. I think we'll be better than that as we exit the year. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: We'll still be running uphill in the first half of the year. But it should be when we lapped the thing, at the end of May, we should be accretive and we should be heading towards good high-single-digits as we go into the second half of the year. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. From the standpoint of, I mean, we want to get double of that. We want a one in front (46:48) of that thing soon. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Again, that's operations that's without the amortization and then the restructuring is going to be lumpy. So we're building in the certain amount of restructuring in. But depending on how things develop, we might end up doing more next year, so we don't have a really good beat on that right now. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I like the pace. I like most of these guys doing a good job. The whole organization of Valves & Controls there with Final Control's getting engaged, and so I would say we're slightly ahead of where we thought we'd be right now. And what I'm looking for without the amortization and restructuring, I want 10% and then we'll go from there to 12%, and then we'll go there \u2013 I mean, that's what I'm looking for and so for the guys like Ram and your team out there, I'm thinking 10% for the year, and I'm sort of like a target-driven type of guy if you haven't figure that out. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Sounds like that would screen well against the EPS range. And then... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I communicate over the conference call as all the people listen to our conference, I got 80,000 people listening right now the conference call. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: You've given me stage fright. Hey, the free cash flow guidance looked again exceptionally strong, great conversion. As you transition out of fiscal 2018, is there a challenge in the near-term to holding the absolute levels of cash flow into 2019? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: If we have a continued improvement in our profitability, continued improvement in growth and with what we have with the Valves & Controls opportunities, in the Final Control area, I think we still have a good run of cash flow conversion opportunities both in 2019 and 2020. I think if we map out and we look at how do we get to $3.3 billion of operation cash flow in 2020, we have to continue and convert well north of 100% and that's going to be a lot of that is getting the cash, basically $400 million, $500 million of cash that we see in the Final Control balance sheet right now converted into cash flow. And I feel very good about it. We've done this over the years very well, and I think with a little bit of growth and improvement in profitability and investments we need to make there, I feel good about getting that $300 million to $400 million of cash flow over the next three years, and I don't think it's a one \u2013 I don't think it's a two year thing here. I think we've got several years of run with it. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You take care. All the best to you. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, good afternoon Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Rich. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So just on \u2013 from a customer standpoint, with your key customers, are you hearing from the customers that it's important to have the full suite of offerings and solutions. And is this \u2013 have seen evidence of that, because we can't see that on our end and just curious if that's partly the motivating factor. I mean, obviously, there's clear reasons why this could came together. But just curious if there's any evidence from customers that they want this? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We're seeing more and more requests on the larger projects in certain industries that they want to see an integrated solution both on DCS and on PLC and other type of control end-to-end customers, and particularly they're going into the industrial Internet of thing and they're more software, and they're more management control. So we're seeing this requests both in the power industry, in the chemical industry, in the pharmaceutical industries. We're seeing this across the various industries these days, in oil gas. And so customers are asking for this. And I think that it is an opportunity for us in the United States to put two very strong players together with a strategic fit to create a better solution for our customers, and our customers are clearly asking for this. I can find \u2013 I'm sure you can find examples of customers that are saying no, but I can find there's more customers saying yes. And so I fundamentally believe that this is the right thing to do for our customers to keep them competitive, to allow them to produce more efficiently, especially with the newer technology when they want to use less and less people out there. So the answer is, yes, we're getting asked. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then just as we think about fiscal 2018 guidance, can you quantify the sales that were lost in the quarter and how meaningful that could be for 2018? And then just on China for Commercial Residential Solutions, it was a great year in 2017. What's your growth outlook here with the comps being pretty tough? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. So, on the hurricane. So, I got all my friends out there, my auditors, my friends, and everything like that. My fundamental gut \u2013 and this is David Farr speaking from \u2013 see I only have 36 years of experience, business experience, so I'm a young kid compared to Tim. I think there is an impact around $30 million to $40 million in the quarter. It's not a huge number. And don't ask me to go audit that because I won't spend a nickel on it. This is just my intuition seeing what I saw from our customer bases and saw what went on in across the key markets. There was a lot of devastation and I want to thank my organization for rising up and helping people in their own company, but also people outside their own company, as we went through this tough time. It will spread out over the whole year because it's going to be \u2013 it's going to take time, obviously, in the residential marketplace to rebuild. It will take time in the automation space and the projects that were delayed. So I don't think you can see a meaningful bump. I just know it's there and I know, over time, we will get that back. And I think we'll get that back over the next 10 to 12 months. And so, it's a positive wind to our back that's all I can say to you there. Now let's go to China. We had it very good in China. We grew in total, I think, a little over 10% globally for the whole year, what was that \u2013 what was the number for the whole year, Tim? I know \u2013 Tim doesn't have 36 years of experience in this industry, so still looking at the book. I mean he's taking awhile. What did we grow in China? [0GL7XZ-E Tim Reeves : Hold on, 15.4%. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: 15.4% for the whole business for everybody. So from my standpoint this year, as I look at the momentum we see in orders and Automation Solutions and opportunities still on Commercial Residential, I'm looking in the high-single-digit. It will be a lot tougher. But I will be disappointed if we don't approach the 10%. We may not get to 10%, but basically what I'm seeing the activity around Automation Solutions and orders based on what I'm hearing early stages out of the Commercial Residential, it's going be tougher. But I still think that we're going to be looking at \u2013 I think we're going to be in that 8%, 9% 10% range, still a good year. And we do well in China, as you well know. I'll be there next week. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You take care. Great talking to you, Rich. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yes. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good afternoon, Dave, and gang. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Rob. Where you're hiding out today? You hiding here in St. Louis, or where are you hiding out? Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Suitable undisclosed location like Boston. In any event, since we can't talk about Rockwell \u2013 so we can't talk about my favorite topic, Rockwell. Let's just talk about \u2013 maybe you can talk about incremental margins over the next couple of years from Automation Solutions given the fact that you have two scenarios, one which kind of a stair-step of growth and the other maybe more explosive growth which will lead to more investment and the relative mix. But how do we think about kind of incremental margins structurally in that business over the next couple of years and maybe take into account the accretion such that it is Valves & Controls? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: What we've been talking to the team about internally on this, I want to get back to 19% over the next couple of years here by 2020. That means that so incrementally they're going to have to be in the 30s as we go forward here. Some of it's going to be, obviously, the improvement of Valves & Controls, some of it will be across the other businesses. But even with what I would look as a good recovery, a very solid recovery, I fundamentally believe we can get back into that 19% by 2020. Now, as you know, we peaked close to 21% in this space, clearly with Valves & Controls, it's going to take us a lot to get back over that 20%. But I fundamentally believe that we can get back to 19% within this next three-year window. And we'll get into that \u2013 into with the opportunities that I see there. I don't see why we can't do it. I mean it's \u2013 we should be able to do that. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, just as a follow up on Valves & Controls. Obviously, one of the potential strategic value that could be coming out of it is, obviously, reversing some of the under-penetration you had in the Kingdom. And you did travel over to Saudi, I think, with Trump and \u2013 The President, excuse me, in May. But how do you think... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You should be more respectable there. Come on, I mean, I... Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. No, no. El Presidente. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. It's hurting me, Rob. Not just \u2013 I'm the Chairman, you know, what I'm saying. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: But in any event, you have been over there, but obviously we've had some pretty interesting kind of Game of Thrones headlines over there. I mean how do you think about in the context of maybe getting share back there, the outlook for the Middle East? And then, where do you see the risk on the geopolitical side as well, given the fact that you've been in the region recently? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: A couple of things. One, we are making headway. We have been given approvals to be able to sell back and come off the list to sell our full product offering in the Kingdom. I will be back in the Kingdom in January. We are opening a whole new innovation center right there in support of Aramco. And \u2013 so I'll be in there meeting with the CEO of Aramco and talking to them. Our capabilities are well respected and known within the Kingdom and what we have to offer. They fundamentally understand that our processes, our disciplines around our business on Automation Solutions is different, and that we'll make sure that we follow the rules and regulations. We followed their local content and stuff like that. So I like where we sit right now with the Kingdom and the opportunities and we'll continue to invest and we'll continue to go. I mean clearly, there is some shaking out. I mean clearly they have a different political system than we do where someone says you're going to go and you're going to go and come in, it's not like an elected process. We're watching this. But I feel still very good. I'm seeing them \u2013 our business pick up in orders in the Kingdom. Across the Middle East, clearly, I think we're going to have a better year. And from my perspective, I look at, again, the combination of the potential compelling strategic fit between Rockwell and Emerson, to me it looks pretty good even in the Middle East, too. Both of us do well there and I think we have opportunities there. So I feel okay with the Middle East. I think we're going to have a decent year in the Middle East. And clearly, there's always risk relative to political and also war issues relative to the Middle East, but feeling pretty good about that. Right now, I like where we are. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good luck with your November. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Two more. Hello, how are you doing? Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Well, hey, thanks for fitting me in. So maybe sticking to Rob's last question on incremental margins. So, Dave, you talked about 30% over the next few years in Automation Solutions. I'm just trying to understand your guide here. You've got mid-single-digit type growth across your businesses and it seems like you've got lower incrementals baked in for this year. So help me understand what's going on in both Automation Solutions and C&RS just from a margin standpoint? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean, I think that we have baked in the 30%. I mean, I \u2013 the only headwinds we have at the macro level at this point in time, if you look at those EPS, is obviously clearly the impact of the tax rate and also the impact we have probably neutral relative to corporate around the final tranche of our \u2013 we've gone to an annual stock incentive program. It is a three year incentive program. The headwinds are pretty neutral there. So I think, right now we're giving you the \u2013 if we approach 6% we'll have obviously a little bit higher earnings, if we approach the lower end we're going to have less earnings. I feel we'll give you more details around the pieces in February, but I feel right now we have a forecast that's very doable one with the way the wind's going at this point in time. So there's no hidden agendas in that number at all. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And I guess maybe just sticking for that, well, for one second just of the price, what's your embedded price cost for 2018? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Pretty neutral. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: It's neutral. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Right now, it's pretty neutral. It might be slightly negative, but it's pretty neutral at this point in time. I mean, there's a lot of moving parts but it's going to be better this year than it was last year. And so, clearly, we're having to deal with net material inflation, we're going to have to \u2013 we figure out some pricing and it's going to be more rear end loaded as we come out of this. But I think it's pretty well focused at this point in time. And I feel pretty decent about it. It'll gets tougher in the first couple of quarters and get easier. So I like where we are right now in this area, too. I think we're in a good position. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And maybe if I could follow-on with one last thing. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Go ahead. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Look, the orders have been great in Automation Solutions, right? And what's interesting is if you kind of look across the rest of the space, and the value chain, power and chemical CapEx has been a pretty lively discussed negative from a lot of your peers. I'm just curious, what you're seeing in that end market, because I think those two end markets still represent at least a quarter of your Automation Solutions business. So be curious to hear what you're seeing there? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We're seeing our customer base; we're winning right now in this space. We brought some unique technologies out and we've been able to help in this area. So we've been winning across the board. If I look at all of my end markets, if I look at all the key markets I serve, for oil and gas to powered to chemical to pharmaceutical, the mining \u2013 even mining is doing well for us right now because of the support that V&C got for us \u2013 gave us. We're seeing a pretty good momentum. And we've had good spending capabilities in the power and the chemical, people are upgrading and they are investing in the technologies for the improvement in productivity and efficiency. So we've seen a different marketplace than everybody else. And so we've been clearly gaining in this space. And as you well know, we are very focused, we have a lot of new products coming out and I think we're winning at this point in time. So I feel, I like the fact that we're outperforming a lot of people in that space right now, it's good news. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks. Thanks, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. One more question here. Thank you. I appreciate everyone. I can't get to everybody, but call Tim Reeves. Operator : Okay. Thank you. And that last question is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thank you... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Gautam? Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: ...for fitting me in guys. Yes? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I can hear you. Not as well of course. I can hear it. Go ahead. Go ahead. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. Good. Good. So, Dave, you mentioned, you've done \u2013 you and the rest of your team has done a heroic job of improving the balance sheet over the past couple of years and you mentioned in your scripted remarks that you're going to remain disciplined. I was wondering if you could give us some insight in how you assess the opportunity cost of your capital. If you can give us any sort of metrics on what type of a hurdle rate you have for acquisitions in terms of cash on cash returns? What type of weighted average cost of capital you and the board look at to measure that type of return? And then as a follow-up if you can talk about whether there are enough independent discrete properties out there in discrete automation to allow you to kind of do this on a niche basis or do you have to go big. So any sense for financial framework and then can it be done outside of a Rockwell type sauce (01:03:32)? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. So, the first one, I'm not going to give you that much insight because that's, obviously, something that we, as a company, think about. And we've made very strong returns over the years and some people say, I have done some good ones and some bad ones. We've all done good ones and bad investments. But from our standpoint, what I mean by discipline, we will make sure that we will create value for our shareholders from the standpoint of what we see and a combination of any strategic large transaction such as a Rockwell and we have to support that within our own board. We have to support that with our own sense of risk assessments. Again, we've done certain things like \u2013 I think Pentair Valves & Controls would be a classic example. And someone says it was a small deal, but at $3.15 billion, it's not a small deal. It's a pretty big deal. And I think we stayed disciplined on what we thought we could make an adequate return on that. Clearly, it's also size \u2013 we risk assess something depending on where they happen we size the company, the technologies. Clearly, a transaction like Rockwell is well within our known space. We are a major player in automation, so we feel less risk around that. It's all I can tell you that this is something that we really feel quite strongly about. But at the same time, I'm not going to kill the company I run today to make a transaction happen. Now relative to the opportunities out there, the answer is yes. There are smaller opportunities out there that we can, over time, continue to make acquisitions, someone asked me \u2013 someone talked about that, yes, they're smaller. Yes, I can do some joint ventures. I can do some technology sharing. So there are things we can do. So we will make a decision. We're a healthy company. We'll move forward and make the other investments if we're not able to make the very large strategic acquisition that we talked about. But right now, there are other opportunities out there that we think got them that can make sense for us. It will take us longer to go that route, but we're a successful company, we'll continue to make those investments. But we're going to stay very focused on this automation space and the commercial residential space. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: But to your point on discipline \u2013 I just want to be clear, in terms of the delta between whatever return you promised to the board and your weighted average cost of capital on a large transaction, is that \u2013 it doesn't have to be a much wider gap, i.e., you anticipate a much higher return to compensate for the opportunity cost of that capital or are you willing to go lower for something there? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No, I will not. I mean if you go lower below your lower cost of capital, you're obviously destroying value. And that's not something this board nor I. We have never known we've made deals. Now we have had acquisitions that did not pan out. Clearly, we made mistakes, but we would not normally go in there and say we're going to destroy value. That's not what I \u2013 I have a fiduciary responsibility as a Chairman and CEO of this company to make sure, as does this board, to make sure you make the right strategic deals. If I can't demonstrate in a reasonable level of risk assessment with discussion amongst the board members and their advisors, then I can't deliver or say we can make value then we're not going to do that. So that's how we look at this thing. We've been involved in transactions and deals for a long, long time, and we will continue to do that way. So I'm going to break it off here. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I want to thank everybody for joining today. And then the key issues, couple points I want to make. Emerson today has a very strong business profile where the two platforms are doing well. I think the momentum is very positive on our side. I think we had a very good 2017 outlook for even a better 2018 relative to our standpoint of growth and profit improvement and cash flow. Clearly, I think that the Rockwell opportunity has tremendous strategic fit with Emerson. It clearly fits in the opportunities for our customers and for technologies and for the communities and for our employee base, it's very positive and something we're really going to work hard at. However, we do have options outside the window, so we're not going to make this forever. It's a finite situation. At some point in time, as I told my board today, to their board meeting, that we will move forward. If we're not able to engage and do it, then we have other opportunities we can move forward on and continuing to invest in the company, continuing to prosper as a company and continue to do well for our shareholders. So with that, I want to again thank everybody for joining us, I want to thank all the employees for having a great 2017 happen and now look forward to a strong 2018. Thank you very much everybody. Operator : Thank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to Emerson's Conference Call. During today's presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. This conference is being recorded today, February 6, 2018. Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Tim Reeves, Director of Investor Relations of Emerson. Please go ahead, sir. Tim Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you, Denise. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's first quarter 2018 results. The accompanying slide presentation is available on our website. So I'll start with the first quarter summary on slide 3. Sales in the quarter of $3.8 billion increased 19% with underlying sales up 7%, reflecting continued favorable trends in our end markets and a strengthening macroeconomic environment. We closed out the quarter with December trailing three-month underlying orders up 7% and we expect to stay in a 5% to 10% range as we go forward. Profitability was strong. In the base business, excluding Valves & Controls, gross margin was up 170 basis points and EBIT margin was up 70 basis points. GAAP EPS increased 9% and was up 18% excluding current and prior-year tax items. We accelerated share buybacks, as discussed on our November 28 conference call. And in total, we repurchased over 7.8 million shares in the quarter. And together with dividend payouts, we returned over $800 million to shareholders in Q1. Overall, the first quarter performance was stronger operationally than we had anticipated a few months ago. Turning to slide 4, first quarter gross margin was up 170 basis points excluding Valves & Controls. Margin improvement was driven by operating leverage and the benefits from prior-year restructuring actions. Price/cost in the quarter was approximately flat. Other deductions increased $55 million due to Valves & Controls' first year acquisition accounting charges, foreign exchange losses and higher amortization expense. Turning to slide 5, from a geographic perspective, demand was broad-based with both mature and emerging markets accelerating in the quarter. Mature markets grew mid-single digits, led by the U.S. and robust growth in Canada. Europe was flat; however, orders are trending favorably and we expect positive results in Europe in the second quarter. Emerging markets were up high-single digits, led by China which was up 23%. Excluding China, the rest of Asia was up mid-single digits. Latin America was up 4%. Middle East and Africa was down 5%, but orders here are trending favorably and we expect growth in the second quarter. Turning to slide 6, total segment margins, excluding Valves & Controls, improved 70 basis points to 18.6%, driven by leverage on higher volume and the benefits of prior-period restructuring actions. Corporate and other charges increased $50 million, including $25 million of Valves & Controls' first year acquisition accounting charges. Operating cash flow was $447 million, an increase of $37 million or 9% versus the prior year. Free cash flow of $351 million was up 13%. Trade working capital, excluding Valves & Controls, improved 20 basis points to 18.2%, driven by execution around accounts receivable collections and payables management. Turning to slide 7, Automation Solutions underlying sales grew 9% in the quarter and was led by North America and Asia. North America underlying sales were up 14%, reflecting continued investment by shale customers, midstream upgrades and high-teens growth in Canada. Asia underlying growth was up 13% with China up 22% and the rest of the region up mid-single digits. Growth was driven by MRO spend and increasing mix of small and mid-sized projects and continued favorable trends in key discrete and industrial markets. Margin, excluding Valves & Controls, improved 120 basis points to 17.8%, reflecting leverage on higher sales and the benefits from prior-period restructuring actions. December three-month underlying orders were up 7%, reflecting strong global energy-related, life sciences and chemicals markets. We are raising our full-year sales guidance for Automation Solutions. The first quarter results and orders trends support full-year 2018 underlying sales growth of 6% to 8%, up from prior guidance of 5% to 7%. Turning now to slide 8, Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales increased 5% with reported sales flat, reflecting the divestiture of the ClosetMaid business on the first day of the quarter. Demand was led by Asia with China up 24% and the rest of Asia up high-single digits. North America underlying sales were up 1%, as steady demand for professional tools was offset by difficult prior-year comparisons in residential air conditioning markets, as a period of late-season hot weather led to strong channel replenishment orders in the prior year. Margin increased 20 basis points to 20.1%, reflecting leverage on higher sales and the ClosetMaid divestiture, partially offset by warranty costs. Overall, growth and profitability of the segment reflects a continuation of the cycle that started in the second half of 2016. December three-month underlying orders were up 5%, reflecting strong global demand in air conditioning, refrigeration and construction-related markets. We are raising our full-year sales guidance for Commercial & Residential Solutions. The first quarter results and orders trends support full-year 2018 underlying sales of 4% to 6%, up from prior guidance of 3% to 5%. Let's turn to slide 9, which summarizes the impact of U.S. tax reform. On an ongoing basis, Emerson will benefit from a lower tax rate. For the full-year 2018, we expect a consolidated tax rate of 25% to 27% and, in 2019 and thereafter, approximately 25%, which reflects a full 5 to 6 points' improvement from historical levels. The table on the right steps through the impact of adoption-related items on our first quarter results. A repatriation tax on foreign earnings of $185 million was offset by a $98 million reduction of our net U.S. deferred tax liability and a $130 million repatriation reserve accrued in prior periods. The net impact of these items in the first quarter was an income tax benefit of $43 million or $0.07 of EPS. Turning to slide 10, which steps through changes to our EPS guidance, the table starts with our November 7 adjusted EPS guidance, which excluded two items \u2013 Valves & Controls' first year acquisition accounting charges and a tax-related loss on the divestiture of the ClosetMaid business. These items totaled $0.07 in the first quarter results and were offset by the $0.07 benefit of tax reform items discussed on the prior slide. As these adjustment items are offsetting, we will guide only on a GAAP basis going forward. As shown here, we are raising the low end of our guidance $0.30 and the high end $0.20 based on stronger operational performance, higher share repurchases and the benefit of a lower tax rate. Finally, let's turn to slide 11, which outlines our updated guidance. We expect underlying sales growth of 5% to 7% with Automation Solutions up 6% to 8% and Commercial & Residential Solutions up 4% to 6%. GAAP EPS of $3.05 to $3.15 is up 20% to 24% versus the prior year or up 11% to 15% excluding the impact of tax reform. We expect operating cash flow of $2.9 billion and we expect to convert free cash flow at 120% of net income. We are increasing our capital spending outlook to $575 million or approximately 3.4% of sales, reflecting our more positive outlook on the global business environment. In addition, we've provided second quarter guidance of underlying sales up 7% and GAAP EPS up 21% to $0.70. And now, I will turn the call over to Mr. David Farr. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much, Tim. I want to welcome everybody, and I truly appreciate you joining us for this conference call. I also want to thank the global Emerson organization for their tremendous performance and a very strong start to the new fiscal year of 2018, with sales, underlying sales up 7%; the margins improving, underlying margins improving; EPS up 9% of GAAP at $0.61, truly having a very strong start to the first quarter of our new fiscal year; and cash flow up 9% at approximately $450 million. So a very strong start. And as Tim just explained, we're raising the total guidance for the year and we will be going back to the measure that I believe in quite strongly and it's called GAAP. And with the tax reform activity and our performance now and the repositioning running through the company, we now can return back to reporting and discussing GAAP earnings, which I think is a relevant measure for our corporation. Again, I want to thank the global team for tremendous execution in particular around the final control team under Mike Train and Ram and with support of that, which we'll update you a little bit about at the conference next week, but clearly doing a great job of integrating and getting some great momentum around the orders, the sales and profitability. So a really good job, well done. As we look at the world today, I feel very good about the trends we're seeing. We always knew our order pattern would have to slow down from the very fast pace coming out of big hole, in particular around the automation business, but the pace of dollars of automation orders are maintaining a very high level of actual dollars, well over $2.35 billion per month on a roll basis. And so it's a good number on a three-month roll basis, is how we look at it and we knew this would happen. The underlying orders are actually very good around the world, and it's why we've always felt that it would slow down into this band we see right now and will generate, as we look at it, 6% to 8% underlying sales growth for Automation Solutions business. And that is a very good number. I've never felt \u2013 as we've talked about it numerous times now, I've never felt the first year out of the box would be a double-digit year. We did not see that, and we'll continue to not see that; however, we see a very strong two-year recovery here a little bit differently than we've seen in the past. And I've been through several recoveries, as you all know, on Automation Solutions business. But overall, the trend line is very good. We're seeing very good orders again in Commercial & Residential, maintaining this 5%, 6%, maybe 7% underlying orders and really seeing some pretty good pattern and support. And they're well into their second year now of the recovery and on very good momentum both in the underlying business and also new technologies. As you look at the world of Emerson, Automation and Commercial & Residential in North America continues to be pretty good. We have a very good start. I don't see that changing. I see our U.S. business being strong for the year and I feel good about that and I see continued investments. In fact, as I look at the underlying gross fixed investment trend lines, which have bumped up since tax reform was passed, it does look at a very good pace of business for the next two years in the U.S. and North America around fixed investment, which is very good. Second, if you look at what we're seeing going on in Asia, China had another very good quarter both in orders and sales. And I see no indication that we will actually slow down. We'll have a very good year in Asia and China. And I expect \u2013 in particular, China, I expect a solid double-digit growth in orders and sales, which at first I didn't think was going to happen, but now as I see the pace of business and investments, I feel better that we should see 10-plus percent sales growth in China, which is an improvement. Relative to the rest of Asia, the order pattern continues to improve. We're seeing the good cycle of businesses and I feel very good about where we sit at this point in time across Asia Pacific, even outside of China. Just coming back to the Middle East and Africa, yes, we had \u2013 sales were still slightly negative, but we've now seen three or four or five months of orders pattern improving, going positive. And as this expects, we had to fill the hole. We filled the hole and now \u2013 from the backlog standpoint, and now we'll start seeing, I would expect, positive sales as we go into the second quarter. And I think we're on a start of a good run of investments in that region, which we haven't seen for the last couple of years, but I feel good about where we sit at this point in time. The last key market's Latin America. We've been waiting for the turn and we've got it. We had a positive sales quarter after basically 12 negative quarters out of Latin America, and order pattern looks pretty good. Sales pattern looked pretty good. So it looks like Latin America has turned for us and that's on a positive surprise is a positive for me, as was China. And as I look at Canada, I see that investment continuing to going up there. So there's some things that are positive for us at this point in time. Out of Europe, our order pattern continues to be positive; and not unusual year for us. We have some quarters that are positive, some flat, some slightly negative. Overall, we expect Europe to be a very solid 5% type of growth marketplace for us this year and we see the pace of business activity going on around that. But clearly, as we go into the second quarter, we, at this point in time, see another good solid 7% underlying sales growth, which will generate good, obviously, double-digit consolidated sales with the addition of our acquisitions and no real divestiture impact of mix magnitude in there. So we see a very strong double-digit top line sales growth with over 7% underlying growth and we're expecting a very solid $0.70 GAAP EPS for that second quarter around 21%. We're getting ready for our visit to New York and our annual investor conference, which will be held at the New York Stock Exchange this year. Fundamental focus is going to be on reviewing where we see the trend lines heading, which have turned more positive from our review last year. We had a stronger 2017, looks like we'll have a little stronger 2018. So, we're going to give you what we see as the trend line from the 2016 to 2021. Keeping those same measures in place, you can see where we see the pluses and minus takeaways, see the profitability that we see unfolding in the business. And then, most importantly, at the end, looking at the tax impact, the overall impact relative to our cash flow and also impact to our earnings, which both will be positive from the perspective. We want to show the core businesses, what's going on, the impact of this faster growth, stronger marketplaces, and then the impact of the tax reform on overall positive impact to the numbers that you'll see coming out of Emerson over the next couple of years. So, as I look at it and wrap it up and go into Q&A, very strong first quarter. Rate the year, we have momentum, we have good order patterns around the world. Everything is slightly better than I thought. I am okay with the order pattern. I know people might be panicked because things roll, but we fully expected this and we expect this thing to trend into this line and we'll talk further about that next week, but, overall, we like where we sit today. I am not going to talk about the long-term numbers here today because that's all about what we're going to be talking about next week, but I'm here to talk about what we see in the quarter. But needless to say, the OCE, we're very pleased with the operations and the performance in the two platforms in this first quarter, and we look forward to continue to have a very strong total fiscal 2018 based on a very good start to our first quarter. So with that, I'll open the floor up for the first question. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Farr. We will now begin the question-and answer-session. Your first question will come from Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Please go ahead. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, Dave. Hey, everybody. Congrats on the strong quarter. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Hey, Rob. Thanks. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Looks like decent momentum across the board and you called some turns in some areas. So I guess the first question I would have is, with respect to China, you've put up some great growth recently and after there's been very volatile data set probably in the last 18 to 24 months. But given what we've seen with the market pullback here, I mean obviously, there's some concerns about rates, but there's also concerns about overheating in China. And could you talk about maybe the risks you see in China throughout the course of the year? How you feel about the pace and momentum of the business there? Just give us some comfort and color around any kind of China risk. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. Given I'm an expert in what's happened in the marketplace in the last three days, I'm sure I can help you here. But from my perspective, clearly, we've seen a very good investment in the two businesses. On the Commercial & Residential, it's been tight around refrigeration, it's been tight around the environment, and the issue around trying to improve the quality of air. And from the perspective \u2013 can it get overheated because of the government trying to push an issue too hard? The answer is yes. As we see it right now, we do not sense that. I'll be back over there in another month. I feel good about it right now, but there is a concern from the standpoint of the investment period that maybe is a little too aggressive. And historically, what's happened is that they would dial it back, but we don't sense that at this point in time. But that will be a concern for us as we look at this. On the Automation Solutions side, it's very broad-based, so it's not just one type of technology. It's not just one type of industry. It's a very slow, steady type of investment that they're making both for improved quality of their products and quality of their facility inside their country; not only for their own country but also for some of the exports around the world. So I don't sense any overheating there at this point in time, but the one area I do concern about is the government trying to \u2013 on the Commercial & Residential side, trying to drive the environmental issues. And at some point in time, they'd say, hey, we drove it too hard. Let's back that off. And that could create that downturn. But right now, based on what I see in the order pattern, based on the customer pattern, I would say we're going to probably do 8% to 10%. And now, we're talking most likely we're going to be doing \u2013 I think we're going to do double-digits coming out of China. And clearly, with the Commercial & Residential business this quarter, they did a 20-plus percent in this quarter on top of last year's 40% quarter. The odds are extremely high that that's going to get tougher and tougher as we go forward here in the second half of this year and early next year, but they're still going to have growth opportunities throughout Asia, as I look at Commercial & Residential. So they're growing across the whole region. So obviously, a concern, but I feel decent about it right now. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: As a follow-up, obviously, I think you talked pretty definitively about the positive impact of tax reform here and what it could mean. And I think there was an uptick in your own CapEx and the level of business and fixed investment spending across the board. But maybe you could just talk about what are you expecting to see, qualitatively, across certain end markets or geographies, driven by tax reform here that would drive the underlying macro numbers higher, specifically? And why it gives you confidence that perhaps growth can accelerate and extend here. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: From the U.S. manufacturing base, we were given a very, very generous tax reform package. It's very much focused on investments in this country from a technology standpoint, capacity standpoint, something that we have not seen in this country for over 30-some-odd years since the mid-1980s. From the perspective of the companies that we communicate with and we obviously serve, they see this as an opportunity to be encouraged to make those investments and they're going to make those investments. The underlying demand in the U.S. right now is good, so from a demand standpoint, for the first time, we see both the demand and then we're also seeing incentives to make investments. So, what we're hearing and seeing is the upward pace of investment will continue to go in a positive way, and that will \u2013 as long as the demand stays here, both here and internationally, you're going to see these investments continue across our customer base. Now you're going to see in different industries that investments will be stronger than others. Seems like the oil and gas industry and some of the pipeline industries you see in the United States. That's a good thing. You're seeing some downstream. We're seeing a lot of good projects down in the gas, in the downstream marketplace right now in the Gulf region. So in general, we're seeing a lot of our customers are talking about increased investments. We're still seeing a strong focus right now in the short term, what I call quick payback-type investments, especially since you get fast depreciation in the United States. We're starting to see some of the small or medium-sized projects start getting on the books, which will be more for the second half and later part of this year and early next year. And we're seeing the discussion of the longer term projects, but they all see the benefit from a balance sheet standpoint, lower taxes, faster depreciation. And I firmly believe U.S. industry is not going to miss this opportunity. We are not going to miss this opportunity to invest in the infrastructure in this country to drive faster growth, to drive the productivity, and to drive our competitiveness. We were given an opportunity to demonstrate that we were not competitive, and we were given the opportunity to demonstrate that, okay, now do something with it. And I firmly believe that business leaders in this country are going to do something with it. And if not, then shame on us because then we deserve every hit we get coming out of Washington. From my perspective as a CEO and as a leader of the National Association of Manufacturers, we are increasing our investments. We are focusing on the next several years where we're going to take advantage of this. And I think our customer base will begin the same thing, Rob. And we're going to try to continue to get this information out when it becomes more and more knowledgeable. But if you look at the gross fixed investment numbers, they're trending up and I expect that that will continue here throughout 2018 and early 2019. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks very much. See you next week. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: See you next week, Rob. Operator : The next question will come from Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Andrew. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a question on Automation Solutions. You highlighted MRO and small and medium-sized projects. I would imagine these are very good for margin. What kind of visibility \u2013 you've sort of highlighted you're starting to see big investments coming up in the U.S.? What kind of impact will these projects have on your margin? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: The normal cycle \u2013 our margin \u2013 when we have funds (25:40) scheduled out for the 35%, we're looking at the 35% flow-through profitability on the Automation Solutions. It takes into consideration that balance between as we go into those projects, into the larger projects. So we're well into tune that they're very large projects, which won't really start hitting until late 2019, 2020. They will obviously put more pressure on margin. But by that point in time, our facilities are running a little tighter, a little more productive. And so typically we can absorb that. There's nothing unusual in the cycle right now, Andrew, other than, I would say, the sustained period here we're going to have because of the tax law relative to small or medium-sized projects. So I don't worry about the margin and the business. Especially if we see strong investment in North America, which is our core market, the actual \u2013 the pressure will be in the positive side of the margin, not in the negative side of the margin. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got you. And just a follow-up question. I think in your press release, you sort of highlighted that you would consider looking at, I guess, wages in North America. But how should we think about inflationary pressures in 2018, given that a lot of other companies actually are also announcing wage hikes and you have raw materials going up? How should we think about inflation and price/cost? Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. We've been \u2013 and I think you guys heard me. We've been seeing underlying salary and wage increases going up now for the last nine months. At a trend line, we're above 3%. We are not a minimum wage company. We are a company that pays for high skills. And so we have to make sure that our compensation structure, from a wage and salary standpoint and benefits standpoint, we stay competitive and we will have to adjust. We are in a period here that clearly it's very important for us to keep our price/cost in line and make sure we keep ahead and we start having to tweak our prices on upward basis. As we see the commodity pressures building up, we see the wage and salary pressures building up, which are all good things from a mild form of inflation. But clearly, what we have to do is stay ahead of this. And the sections that Frank and Steve will be having with the two platform leaders is we're going to have to be talking, okay guys, you've got to keep putting the pressure on the price increases because we will see the upward pressure on the commodities, the upward pressure on salary and wages. And we must make sure we keep our pricing in line as we go through this time period. We've gone through a period where we were behind the eighth ball. And right now we are in sync. And it's very, very important now as we stay, and we stay in sync here over the next couple of quarters. And I think, Andrew, this is an issue that I ultimately talk about it. And at this point in time, we are ultimately talking internally because we see the pressure is increased material, increased salary and wages. And therefore, we're going to have to slightly bump up our prices. Now that will create, obviously, a higher growth rate at the top, but also we have to make sure we have the resulting cost reductions and price actions around these. So this is an interesting time period, which we have not seen for a while. But we do know how to operate in this time period, and I feel good that we are well inside the scope of where we need to be right now. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you. Very good. Good questions. Operator : The next question will come from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Steve. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: So just on kind of the cash flow and the dynamics around CapEx, when do you expect to kind of hit this run rate? And you look like you'll a little be under the kind of 3.5% this year. Will you be above it for any of these years over the next couple of years as a percent of the sales? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, I think that if you look at \u2013 okay, if you look at our capital spending, if you go by quarter, we typically start slower and we build up in the year-end. It's how we decide. It's the way the company is set up and what goes on inside the company. If you look at the overall, I would say that our capital will be \u2013 is lumpy. We could \u2013 this year, we could be a tad under 3.5%. Next year, we could be a tad over 3.5%. We have similar projects that we might be looking at new capacity, a new facility somewhere, that we'll start working on late this year and make your capital occur in 2019. So I think on average we'll probably be somewhere in the 3.3%, 3.4% range over the five-year time period. But the key issue for me is, as I told my board, unlike the government which clearly had shovel-ready projects all over the place, we don't have shovel-ready projects inside Emerson. If we have a project that we need to do, we do it. But what I'm looking at right now with the stronger demand in our key couple businesses and a shifting where that demand is coming around the world, we're going to need to make some different type of investments here in North America, in particular the United States, to be more productive and have a lot more flexibility around our facilities which we haven't built into them in the past. So I think this is going to build and I would expect 2019 and 2020 will be bigger capital than this year as I look at it based on what I see and feel right now, Steve. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: As a percentage of sales, right, you meant? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: As a percentage of sales, correct. And the dollars are still going to go up, yeah. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: And so \u2013 and when you look at your cash flow statement, there is this kind of other account. I think there might be some \u2013 that's where you kind of adjust for perhaps your cash taxes versus your book taxes. I don't want to be knit picky, but is there anything now with the lower book tax rate? Anything in that kind of other account that's been a couple hundred million bucks in the last few years and would the new portfolio have \u2013 does that shrink in size or does that go closer to zero, is it less of a factor? I am just trying to kind of get to what the run rate conversion is here going forward. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. Let me \u2013 I'm going to try to grab the chart, Steve, that you're talking about, okay? So I know what I'm talking. Is that in the press release or is it in the slides? C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: No, just from your 10-K. It's 2015, 2016, and 2017 from the 10-K. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Oh, from the 10-K. I'll look at it. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: I'm just trying to get at what the sustainable conversion is here because you guys \u2013 you've talked in 2021 as it being like 105% to 110% or something around that. Now CapEx is bumping up a little bit. You've got some of this tax coming through, so maybe just a little bit of clarity on that. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Steve, I think what you're talking about in that add back is mainly the GAAP pension expense gets added back and then we have the cash contributions that come out of the cash flow and then it's equity comp that gets added back as well. So, no, I don't expect... C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: I don't expect there's going to be... C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: So, that's sustainable? Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: ...a change in that as a function of tax reform or the different configuration of the portfolio. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: Great. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: So let me \u2013 Steve, it's a good question, given all the challenges around this world today about quality of cash and earnings, so let me \u2013 as we get ready for next week... C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: I don't know what you're talking about. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Me either. I just made a statement. You know me. I just made a statement. I got my rally monkey. I've got my bull here. I got a baseball bat and these guys \u2013 it's amazing what they say when they're thinking. But let me \u2013 let's take a look at what we're going to \u2013 because we're going to give you a cash forecast and we're going to give you obviously P&L forecast next week, and let me take a look at what we think the sustainable rate is going to be. As you point out, and you've pointed out to me numerous times, I have a unique window here right now because I have the final control cash opportunities, which we are obviously starting to execute on, which is going to run now for three or four years. I have some increased amortization because of software companies coming on board from that perspective. So, that helps us from a cash flow standpoint. So the question is, as we go through this cycle, we're going to be able to run at a little bit higher rate on a conversion basis than I have historically, and I think that's a very fair question. It's also a very challenging question for me to answer, but I think that I owe you that and the shareholders can we run 110%, 115% conversion? This year, we're talking about running around 120% again, which is a good number. And I do have some things helping me right now, but the question, as we go out of this cycle, is the number going to be 105%, 110%, or 112%? And I think that's a very fair question to ask. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: And then one last quick one just on R&D. Are you kind of full up there on R&D investments, or RD&E? Or is that going to tick up and trend up as well? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think the key issue for me, as I've talked about the trend line of our orders, our trend line of the sales, is in the two key areas. If I see Automation Solutions really starting to take on some bigger projects, they want to bring in some new technologies, then we're going to have to ramp up some R&D. But that will be commonplace if I start seeing our \u2013 our sales order would mean this year, we're going to be more in the 8% range, and I see a pretty good filler relative to projects coming at me. Then we might start ramping up at a couple of new technologies to make sure that we can satisfy that demand that we see coming from our customer base for 2019 and 2020, in particular around our Plantweb Internet of Things. So I think that right now, we're good. But if I start seeing this growth rate pick up a little bit, which could possibly happen, then you're going to see me tweaking a little bit more engineering moneys into here because I want to get ready for the next-generation technologies that our customer base will be going towards as they go into 2020 and 2021. That's what we're going to be watching now. That's the next pivot point that we should be at, and that's the place you should be pushing me. Relative to Bob Sharp's business, I think at this point in time we've continued to give Bob the moneys he needs as he is running at very high levels of profitability. He had an unfortunate situation of a quality issue in the first quarter that we had to deal with and we dealt with it and one of his products, I think, in the thermostat area, and we've dealt with that. But we're giving him the money he needs relative to that next-generation investments to really \u2013 to pull through his digitization in the cold change stuff which you'll hear him talking about and \u2013 so I'm making sure he's got the money he needs right now because there's some good growth opportunities there for that business. So, that's what I see. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: Makes complete sense. Thanks, as always, for the comments. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : The next question will come from Steven Winoker of UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Thanks and good afternoon, all. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Steve. Are you legitimate; we can talk to you? Or what \u2013 are you back in the game here or are you still on vacation? Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Come on, Dave. I assumed you'd read every single page of that report. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Oh, oh, that one. That \u2013 oh, I used that one to put myself to sleep with over the weekend, I'm sorry, I did read that. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Oh, thanks for that big eye. I've got to consider that next time. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Oh, gosh, Steve, I look forward to seeing you next week. Come on up and say hi to me for a change. You've been a stranger for a couple of months. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just following compliance. Anyway, out and good and all that. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I am full compliance. I mean that's why I got my rally monkey. I got my dog here. I've got a bull looking at me right now. I'm full of compliance. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm straight and up, straight up in the air. So listen, I just wanted to chase up the cash flow discussion a little more with regard to 2018, not the longer term. On page 16 on the presentation, you just give the 150% operating cash flow conversion on GAAP, right, step-up from 130%. So I just want to make sure that... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Operating cash flow. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah, so I just want to make sure that that \u2013 the key drivers are there in terms of the change or to what extent \u2013 what are the biggest components of that step-up? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: That's \u2013 you're going to have taxes there. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, you've got taxes there. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: For our guidance. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Right. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: So the \u2013 yeah, that's the differences primarily. There's two things going on with the taxes and a little bit improved profitability overall. Those are the two numbers right there. As you know, given our level of profitability, if we grow a little faster and our margins are \u2013 obviously we're saying we're going to have a better earnings, that helps us. But the big chunk there is the taxes. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And then as you said, you'll give us some more color around that hopefully in terms of longer term. Yeah. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We're going to try to make sure, Steve, because there's two big moving parts in what's happening to Emerson versus last year at this time is we have stronger underlying performance from a sales standpoint, economic standpoint, and then we have a tax reform. So I'm going to try to be as I thought, Tim worked very, very hard to be transparent with you guys on it. You guys may not think that was transparent in all his charts he gave you, but we're trying to be transparent relative to how these numbers are impacting. We'll try to do that again next week for you, so you can get your models set up because there's a rebasing going on right now you're going to need. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And then secondly, maybe diving in a little bit to the Commercial & Residential side of things, on compressors, you're talking about pricing and the need to keep pace on pricing versus cost and how hard that is. And you've been through this multiple times before. Some of the folks in that area are certainly saying that they believe they have a little more, I think a little more pricing power themselves and comfort level with their supply base in terms of their ability to kind of hold costs as well. What are you seeing in that part of the area relative to competition and your ability to get price in that area? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We're in it for the long-term and our customer base know that. And so we work very closely with them. We do get the pricing and we clearly have to make push shoves back and forth, sometimes in and out of sync, sometimes in sync. I think, overall, this will be \u2013 with the \u2013 when you look at copper, you look at steel, you look at the continued commodity increases going on, on the Commercial & Residential side, there's going to have to be a trend line upward across the whole industry. And they have to be very careful from the standpoint \u2013 and we understand that. And that's why we work closely with them. We don't want them priced out of the marketplace either in the end market. So I think that there's some pushbacks always, but I think, over time, we figure out how to make those tradeoffs with changing our products to get them the price point they need and then we can change our products to make sure that we get the cost price points that we need. And as you know, there's not one \u2013 just talk of compressors, there's not just one compressor. We can make changes within a compressor to get what they need and to change that price/cost structure. So there's a lot \u2013 there's going to be a lot of give and take. I think the industry knows right now we're looking in the period, as someone pointed out earlier, potentially we could have higher inflation here. And so we're going to have to start making tradeoffs for both of us to make sure that we both don't get eaten alive in this whole price/cost situation. I think that being a major supplier in this industry, we have that ability to do that with our customer base, and we'll continue to work that. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : And you forced mixed up in the past as well, which has helped. So I'm not sure if you see opportunity there too, mixing up the... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We have a window here again with \u2013 in the commercial standpoint in refrigerant that we will mix up in that space as the transition happens. And the residential side, it's a little bit different this time. I think we're going to see more of a mix up on the commercial in the channel in the next 12 to 18 months in North America. So it's going to be a hybrid approach here. We're going to be making some pushes and shoves. And in the end, we want to come out this ahead, just like they want to come out ahead. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Thanks, Dave. I'll see you next week, and I want to hear the critiques on that report. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Definitely. I will dust it off. It must be underneath my pillow right now. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Good. As long as you have it. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Hopefully, I didn't get too much drool on it. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : That's all right. Better than most. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. See you later, my friend. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : The next question will come from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good afternoon, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Rich. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So on Automation, with regards to investments, with oil where it is, it's up much higher than a year ago and investments have picked up, but you talked about being able to maintain the incrementals at a pretty healthy level without having to make significant investments. When do you see that starting to play out? And I guess that gets into some of the KOB1 projects starting to get booked. And so any color around KOB1? What mix of the orders it is right now? And then, how you see these investments getting layered in over the next year or so? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think what we're seeing right now \u2013 and we're going to share with you basically our project business and what that funnel looks like. We're going to give you the snapshot, which clearly is going to be bigger than the last time we shared with you, which I think \u2013 Tim, when was that? The last conference call, wasn't it? Tim Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes, it was in November, I think we did. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: End of November. So we're going to give you the snapshot and basically, it's consistent measurement across the board. What we're seeing right now are the initial phases around the world of larger KOB2 type of projects where people have done initial expansions or part and now they're going back and they're dusting that off. And that's coming back in the funnel on a rebid or just moving forward depending on where they feel comfortable relative to the cost of the project and the timing of the project. That is already starting to flow. We're starting to see that. And I would expect to see more and more of those bookings as you go forward here this year. On the larger KOB1 projects, which we're starting to bid and talk about, and I know Ed Monser is going to try and talk about one project that he sees going on right now across the final control in particular, we're going to start seeing more and more of that come late in 2018, early 2019. Yes, there's going to be one or two projects out there, but I think that those projects really won't \u2013 starting to play into 2019. So when I'm talking about higher incremental investments is if I start seeing our growth rate sales \u2013 and I see sales, and obviously, orders before the sales, if I start seeing that number clearly looking like it's going to be at the high end of the 6% to 8% and potentially have a chance to cut across that, then we're going to have to start this year. Now, the question will be is, if we're growing faster, we're going to obviously leverage. And obviously, the numbers will look okay in the short-term and when it will come back to haunt us will be in 2019. But if we're starting to see this happen and we're starting to see the larger KOB2, that's what I'm going to trigger off, not the KOB1, because if I start seeing the larger KOB2, which we're going to talk a little bit about next week, that's where we're going to have to start putting some money into play to make sure we protect ourselves from a customer perspective, both from a manufacturing, sales and service organization, because this business, as you know, comes up. And these aren't small products or projects. And so we've got to make sure we can produce them and then deliver them. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So the earliest is really next year is when you would start to see the impact? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. I mean you're going to see \u2013 you'll hear us talking about it, but the dollar, that will be next year. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then on V&C, outside the amortization, you're still tracking to exit the year in the near double-digits on an EBIT margin basis or is that coming in better? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, I think we'll be there. I have no reason to say we won't be double-digit as we -- this year. And I want Ed to talk a little bit about that. Ed Monser is going to give a presentation on what he sees. The team's doing a great job. We are this month starting \u2013 in January and February, we're moving off of the Pentair OMT system, which is \u2013 that's sort of like jumping off the top of this building in a corporate here without a parachute and hoping you can land without breaking a leg. And that's going on right now. So, that's my concern this quarter is to make sure that these guys can get off that into a normal operating system and get away from that Swiss model. But overall, I like where they are from a margin standpoint, sales and order standpoint. And they're starting to talk, which I'm really excited about, technology and where they can bring some new technologies and make some investments in technology, which that business hasn't made in a long, long time. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And then, how about working cap, real quick on that piece? Anything... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: They're slightly ahead of schedule. I would say that \u2013 I would say for the year, they're going to deliver \u2013 my gut tells me that final control will deliver very good cash flow number for us this year. I fundamentally believe that we will have a $2.9 billion. It could be a $2.92 billion. I think we're going to have a good operating cash flow this year. And it's going to be driven off of the work final control does. I mean everyone else is important in the company, but the real delta is there. And I think that Mike Train and his team and Ram Krishnan and his team have a focus on that. They know they have a chance to deliver cash flow to us and we'd really like to see that happen because that makes a big difference in the returns. It also gives us the flexibility that we need from a standpoint of dividends and then share repurchase. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Right. Great. All right. Thank you. See you next week. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: See you next week, Rich. Operator : The next question will be from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Good afternoon, everyone. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Jeff. How are you? Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Doing well. Hey, just a couple more things on V&C, Dave, if I could. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah? Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Could you just give us a sense of what's going on with their orders? Are they primed and ready to take orders, so to speak? Or you're more focused on integration here in the near term? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We're focused on orders. Clearly, there's things we want to get done from an operational standpoint. But we \u2013 if you look at our V&C business right now, we're growing. It's the combination of final control and V&C. It's around 10%. And what's very important to us right now is getting them into the site, which goes back \u2013 I think it was Rich asked me the question. On the projects, so what I'm trying \u2013 we're trying to get them engaged on the KOB2 projects on a full capability. And that's what we're trying to do at this point in time because the early stages of projects are starting to happen. We are building out, as we've talked about, a final control solutions package. And now for the first time, we are going out to the global customer base and saying we have, here it is. And if you look at the projects, some of the biggest componentry is typically around the final control package. So, that's pretty important to us. We don't want to miss the initial phases, those upticks. So, yeah, we're focusing on restructuring, repositioning and making sure we're delivering the profitability and the trade working capital. But in reality right now, what we're also out there working really hard and why Mike Train and Ed Monser and Ram Krishnan \u2013 Ram works so hard on trying to make sure that we got the global sales organization in place. This is so important to us right now, Jeff, because this cycle is happening and we want to get back on track and it'll make a big difference for us relative to recapturing market share that, unfortunately, was lost in the last downturn when the lack of attention in this business. So I like what we see right now and if we can maintain this level of growth in underlying orders, the projects are coming and this will really set us up for a very strong 2019. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And then just on the V&C financials, Dave, the $25 million of acquisition charges, is that inclusive of the run rate amortization or is that more like step-up in other type of...? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: The last piece of the step-up of the word counting rule I've ever seen in my life, as Frank knows, where you have to re-mark or write-off the profit and inventory and the backlog. And so they had a lot of backlog and they clearly had a lot of inventory. And this is the last phase, the last piece \u2013 Frank said I maybe have a couple of more million left next quarter, but I'm not talking about it. This is the last piece of that. That's what that is right there. That's the last piece of that accounting revaluation of backlog and profit and inventory. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And then just one more for me. I think some folks are viewing the strength as almost a glass half empty. Demand is good, therefore you need to spend capital, therefore that's a negative. I think I heard you say at the beginning of this call that even with higher spending you're quite comfortable that your incremental margins can traffic in the mid-30s. Does that hold looking out into 2019 and 2020 when you're looking at these higher levels of CapEx? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, we're going to \u2013 we're on track to get back to the levels of profitability, the 19% EBIT margin that we talked about last year with the V&C. We are on track to get that in the same cycle, so even with a higher growth rate, I still feel very good at the stronger growth rate, we're on track to get the mid-35s, the mid-30s on the incremental margins. We feel good about that at this point in time. The only place I see that we'll have to start spending money is that growth rate goes up, but given the fact that what's going to happen is if growth rate goes up, our spending will always be behind the growth, so we're going to probably have pretty good leverage. It's when those rates start coming in sync. So I feel very good about the margins, incremental margins out of the Automation business for the next couple of years. The cycle started, and we have bumps and things in a quarter or two, yes, but overall I see no reason right now that we're slightly ahead of last year for margin, we're slightly ahead this year and I think we'll get to that 19% that we talked about in the Automation Solutions with V&C by the 2021. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. Thank you very much. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much. Appreciate it, Jeff. Operator : The next question will come from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Hello all. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Hello, Chris. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hey, Dave. You mentioned hybrid as a good source of growth in the press release today. Kind of an interesting call-out given, I think, that was part of the rationale on the Rockwell look. But how efficiently would you say that market served today from the discrete and process sides respectively? And are you seeing any separation among the people that have been focused on it on the past 10-plus years? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No, the reason we called out the hybrid is because if I look at the underlying industries that use a lot of the hybrid technology, those industries have been the strongest places for investments, say for a classic example would be a pharmaceutical. Now from my perspective, I think that you have a clear group of leaders in the hybrid space today. There's three or four of us that are pretty strong. I think there's \u2013 if you look at the \u2013 and we'll talk a little bit about, as you look at the breakdown of others in this industry, I think there's some consolidation efforts and some squeezing that could happen here. There's room to grow for the four major players and to take out more share within that space, and I think that you're hearing a lot of the key guys in this space talk about it and I think there is plenty of room here for the next three, four, five years for us to gain into that space. But from my perspective, I think the initial phase is some of the hybrid investments underway are good and you're going to start seeing some of the old line process automation areas of investments happening later this year or going into next year, but right now the hybrid space is what took off earliest and I think that's good and there's room for it to run. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. And then a bookkeeping question. On the walk from the prior adjusted EPS, you have the $0.05 to $0.15 adjustment for operations and repurchase, but you add the low end of that $0.05 to $0.15 to the high end of the prior range. Is that just conservative or if you're seeing the stronger markets will you fund more restructuring or something? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. We'll pay for (54:12). We just had a good first quarter. We beat and we raised more than we beat the first quarter. I want to make sure that we're not setting ourselves up to some number we can't make happen. So that's what's going on here, Chris. I think that there's no additional restructuring underway. If we have \u2013 there's nothing hidden in here from the P&L. If we can get a little faster growth and margin conversion, you're clearly going to get the earnings. There's no hidden. There's no incremental investments I'm trying to hide here. I'm trying to make sure that we put a forecast out for you that we can deliver, plus or minus the pennies that we talk about every quarter, and that's all it is. And it was a good beat and we raised. And I didn't feel like I have to go crazy on a raise. Tim Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.: And mechanically, we're bringing the bottom end up, so that's a bigger number. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Right. Got it. Thanks. Operator : The next question will be from... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No good deed goes unturned. Okay. What was that? Sorry. Go ahead. Operator : I'm sorry. The next question will be from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Hi, it sounded, no good deed goes unpunished on Joe. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: No, that is true. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I guess if I don't want to be the heat, I should quit being CEO, but I sort of enjoy being CEO. It's a lot fun. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah, you must enjoy it. It's been some time. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Almost it's 17 1/2 years. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So maybe my starting question here is on just this incremental margin discussion specifically around Automation Solutions. If I pull out the V&C impact this quarter, I get to like a high 20s-type incremental margin, which is a little bit lower than I would have guessed just given you've got sort of... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No, I think it's more like 40% \u2013 35%, 40%. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: More like 40%? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, I mean we could take you through that. Frank, you've got the numbers there. We've seen it. I saw people talk about that. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Yes. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: If you take out the acquisition impact and some currency headwind that we have in there that's not obvious, it's mid-30s \u2013 mid to high-30s. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. Okay. Got it. So, that ticks that box. And I guess in terms of just you guys have been talking about price/cost being neutral for the quarter. I think, Dave, going back to like last quarter, I think the initial assumption was that it was going to be slightly negative in the first half of the year and maybe making it up in the second half. So is there a chance then that price/cost can be positive as we progress through this year? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Well, I thought \u2013 I wouldn't bet on that one. I think going back to, it was a very good question somebody asked me but if you look at the pieces that go into the cost side of this, there's more pieces on the cost side that are going up than we've seen in a while. So we're going to have to make sure we keep that price piece moving up with it. It's not going to be big dollars, but we're going to have to \u2013 we had pretty good mix from the standpoint of some of the KOB3 type of stuff. We had some pretty good mix in some of the businesses in Commercial & Residential. Right now, I think if we can \u2013 I will consider this a win for us this year if we're $1 green. I mean, I'll buy everyone a drink on that one because this is what's going to be, I think, the most challenging thing for us, Joe, this year because of the fact that we see a lot of moderate inflation pressures coming at us, but I feel very good that we could offset that because we've been getting ready for this for a while. And I'll repeat it again. We're going to have to work very closely with our customers here to be doing some mix and the matching and some changing here to help them solve their cost price, and they're going to have to help us solve our cost price because this is not something that's going to be a brute force effort here or that'll come back to haunt both sides, which I don't want to see happen, as you can imagine. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah, that makes sense, Dave. If I can maybe fit one more in here, we haven't talked about... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Go ahead. I ain't going anywhere. I'm still CEO. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: 17 years and counting. If you take the $3 billion or so that you have on your balance sheet right now and you talked in the past a lot of that is international, are there any \u2013 is there any hindrances to bringing that cash back and getting it invested? Is there some type of timing that we should be thinking about on that cash? Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: No. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I'll let Frank answer that first and then I'll give you my two cents. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: No, Joe, we're expecting to bring back little over $1billion of it this fiscal year. I would expect to bring back a substantial chunk in the second quarter and then probably another amount that'll take us over $1 billion later in the fiscal year. So, no, there are no impediments. We'll be bringing almost half of what we have overseas back in the next year or so. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. So we \u2013 one of the good things the tax reform does for us is it gives us that freedom to make that call when we want to do it. We only have a couple markets in the world that really our cash will get trapped. It's hard to move it around into one of those markets. In China, basically every about 12 or 18 months we get cash out. We've brought out over $3 billion since I've been CEO out of China. And so we've a lot more freedom, a lot more flexibility under this whole new tax reform. That gives the U.S. companies a lot more competitive opportunities here which we have not had in the past, and that's one of the advantages. And I'll say it again, if U.S. companies don't take advantage of what Congress passed in this tax reform, then we're flaming idiots. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: All right. On that note, thanks, guys. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: All right, Joe. Operator : The next question will be from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Deane. Where you hiding out today? Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Just downtown Manhattan here. Living the dream. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Living the dream! Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yes, sir. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You got like your feet up on the desk having a drink, Mai Thai or something like that right now, Deane? Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : No, no, no. That's for later. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : No, still \u2013 we got to drill down in something as exciting as the tax reform and just to follow up on Joe's last questions there. Were there any surprises as you kind of work through the angles on tax reform? We had you pegged coming in around 27%, and it looks like that benefit is significantly better for you. So, what were the kind of puts and takes as you went through that? And what's that step-up and further benefit in 2019? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. I mean as you know, I was a very much engaged in this process as the Chairman of NAM and working with the Congress and the White House. And then also, Frank's team was right with me the whole time. I think that from our perspective, we've always felt it was going to be around 5 or 6 points of just pure rate benefit for us and there was \u2013 in fact at the 11th hour, they took a little bit away from us where we \u2013 from the standpoint. But overall, we \u2013 it pretty well came in line where we thought it was going to be. I was pleased, and we've been positioning ourself now for the last 12 months. So from the pure payment, we're going to have to pay the government over the next eight to nine years. I think that number, we can minimize that number a little bit. The overall sort of restatement off what I'd call fixing the deferred tax on our balance sheet, I think that's \u2013 we're clean there. We didn't have anything hidden in there that we had to write off. And then the other benefit that Frank and his team did is when we did the sale of the two \u2013 the businesses, we made the decision to go ahead and book the tax costs. So, that gave us a big benefit that when we waited to bring the money back that we're actually saving about $125 million of actual cashes on taxes here because we waited because of the lower tax rate. So overall, Frank and his team, they knocked this one out of the park. And so from our shareholders' perspective, they've got a lot of benefits here both this year and then next year, we're going to obviously get a lower tax rate. And then you look at my competitors which are international companies, we're going to be \u2013 on a tax rate now, we're right there. We're competitive to anybody, and I'll take my cost structure and my flexibility on anybody any day. So I like where we are right now, Joe (sic) [Deane], and I think we're in a pretty good shape. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then if you could just clarify on the CapEx spend increase, how much of that might be influenced because of the tax advantages on CapEx? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Deane. I thought it's Joe. I apologize, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : No worries. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: From my standpoint, there's two things going on. Long-term, the way I went in and I was pushing so hard working with Congress is we have a aging workforce in North America right now. And as we see the underlying demand come into the next generation of products in Automation, we're going to have to invest to make sure our facilities are more competitive from the flexibility and the type of stuff we want to do with our manufacturing. So the increase in capital we're going to see is mainly around Automation and some incremental capacity and flex-type of capacity that we're going to need to serve this U.S. marketplace because our strategy has always been we stay local for serving. So we manufacture here in the region here just like we do in Europe, just like we do in Asia. So I think what we're seeing we're going to have to do is spend a little bit more money on the Automation side of this company and that means we're going to have to spend some incremental capacity. And I would say that we'll also bring some bricks and mortars because we're going to have to reconfigure our facilities, which always means new bricks and mortars at the same time. So I think it's going to be pretty good for non-res here for the next couple of years. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good. We'll see you next week. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: See you next week, Deane. I apologize for calling you Joe. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : No worries. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. Operator : The next question will come from Gautam Khanna of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Gautam. It's good to talk to you again. You've been hiding on me? Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: A little bit. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Don't comment on that one, Gautam. You just ignore me on that one. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: That's fair. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: That's fair. I just gave you the only thing I wouldn't take. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah, yeah, I agree. Couple of questions. I guess, first, you mentioned one of the milestones you're sort of tracking on the V&C integration this month, but what else can we look for over the next 12 months? What are the big milestones we should be kind of paying close attention to as you integrate the business? Anything you can give us on that. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. There's three things I'm watching very closely. One is the ability for us to create the solutions packages in the final control that when we're going out to bid, it gives us a competitive advantage. And what that will mean is the order pattern opportunity within the final control should run higher rates than the rest of Automation Solutions. And that gives us a chance that means we're \u2013 from my perspective, that means we're regaining some of the lost presence that we got lost in the \u2013 they got lost in the last cycle. The number two thing we're tracking very clearly that you'll be able to see is the fact that we're talking about, from a margin standpoint, yes, V&C is still diluting to our margin, but a less dilutive impact. And therefore, as you go into the second half of this year, you start seeing the positive impact of the V&C as we wrap around it because you're going to start seeing that live now as we get in that second half. So another milestone we want to watch and something that I'm watching to make sure this team gets their job done. And the third issue, from my perspective, is all around the cash flow. If the cash flow at corporation continues to outperform in the upside, and it's a function of we're still growing nicely the profitability, but because the final control organization is able to get the trapped cash and off their balance sheet from the receivables and the balance sheet from their inventory, if they continue to do that, that will be the third thing. So you'll keep hearing us talk about better cash flow over a quarter or over six or nine months and that tells me that they're getting the job done. Those are the three things I'm watching for the final control organization out there. And that's why we want to see happen because that means they're really bringing a better flow of cash and return and growth to the corporation and hence for the shareholder, which two things are happening. Given the fact the tax rate went down and we're delivering on the savings and growth, that means the return for my shareholder is going to be better than initially planned. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: That's very helpful color. And maybe just a last one to dovetail to your cash flow discussion. You've done a number of tuck-in acquisitions, Cooper-Atkins, you mentioned cold chain, and what you'll talk about next week. But can you characterize how the M&A pipeline looks right now? Do you have any \u2013 what does it look like in terms of size of opportunities, what you expect might actually transact over the next year in terms of dollars spent? Any sort of color around that. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. Yeah, I'll give you some color. Right now, from our perspective, as we look at the transactions today, these are very much transactions which are private transactions. We are engaging with private owners. They're part of a private equity firm trying to come out. They're part of a large corporation. And so right now, we probably have $2 billion to $3 billion that we're actively engaged in. And what we'll report to you is we're trying to get another $500 million, $600 million done this year. What I'd like \u2013 in reality, what I'd like to see if I look at today versus the end of this calendar year, which is the end of 2018, I'd like to see us, in reality, get closer to $1.5 billion to $2 billion done. That's the type of magnitude we're working on right now. We have \u2013 because of where we've been through our repositioning, we probably got ahead of a lot of our competitors and where we are relative to our ability to absorb because we've got the divestitures done and we've got a good head start in V&C. So, what I would call the right number for me right now is not $500 million for the next \u2013 rest of this year. I'd like to really see a number, which is more like $1 billion to $1.5 billion to $2 billion type of range before the end of this calendar year. And that would be, to me, where we should see and that's the type of activity we're working on right now. Now, we may not get them done, but that's what we want to do. We want to try to get that done and that would make our plan all the way out to 2021 a lot easier to execute on because that's front-end loading the acquisitions. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot, guys. See you next week. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Take care, Gautam. And I'll see you next week and thank you very much for the time. Operator : The next question... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: With that, I'm going to wrap it up. Any more questions? Is anybody out there? Operator : There are a few more, sir, if you want to take them, or we can move to the closing if you'd like. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I'll take one more question since you got me trapped. I'll take one more question. Operator : I'm sorry. It will be from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please go ahead. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: On second thought. Okay. Andrew, how are you doing my friend? Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, Dave. How are you doing, man? Just getting under the belt. I like it. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Andrew, you got your tail underneath the door. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Absolutely. So, I just wanted to ask you about Europe in the sense that it was down, but you've mentioned that orders are positive there and it should be better. Europe has had very strong GDP growth, as you know. So is anything going on there, is any reason why it shouldn't grow low- to mid-single digits as you go forward here in 2018? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No, there's nothing going on. From our perspective, it's more of a timing. We had some very large businesses over the last couple of years and we're having to fill that backlog in the Automation Solutions side. On the Commercial & Res, we're doing okay in Europe. It's just a function of timing on the projects for us in Europe. And clearly, from a competitive standpoint right now with the dynamic change in the dollar, we had a slow start to sales in the first quarter, but the orders, I feel good about it. When we talk to the projects, we see things going on. I feel good about that, so nothing unusual. Now, if I have another quarter that I'm disappointed in Europe, then I'll be starting to say, okay, what's going on here. But the only other thing I could tell you that it probably created that weak in the first quarter in Automation Solutions in the first year, if we had our main distribution center in Germany went through an Oracle conversion in the last six months, I can tell you right now it's not gone well and so we struggle with shipments, but that's my bad and my mistake as a CEO and we'll fix that, but overall we're doing okay and if we have another bad quarter, then we're going to figure out what the hell is going on, but right now I feel okay because I think everything is being done right. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, Dave, and that's helpful. So just in Commercial & Residential Solutions in North America, I just wanted to follow up. Last quarter, you had some hurricane impact and maybe there's some reconstruction work to be had here in 2018, so have you seen any impact from that and maybe just talk about the visibility into that particular market? I mean it was up, but it was up marginally. What do you see going forward there in North America? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We see a very good non-res marketplace from the rebuild going on. I think in the housing market, there's a lot of issues relative to around labor and ability to execute, but the timing of replacement market, the timing of the new technology, I mean we really have a situation for the next 12 to 18 months that should be pretty good for us in the U.S. marketplace both in non-res and residential, so I mean we have to continue to execute around that and I like where we are at this point in time in North America in non-res, and again as it wind up nicely for the Automation Solutions in North America, Commercial & Residential should be lined up nicely too for the rest of this year going into 2019 based on the factors that you just threw out there, Andrew, so I like where we sit at this point in time. We have to execute around that. The key issue for us at this point in time is we have to make sure we're starting to make those incremental capacities both in capacity from equipment and also in people, and that's something that we're decent at. We've written it down and now we want to write it up a little bit here, so I like where we are and we should have pretty good winds to our back in this one. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, Dave. See you next week. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: See you next week, and again I want to apologize for cutting you off there, Andrew. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: With that, I'm going to wrap it up. I want to thank everybody. Tim, great job with the charts. I mean for Mr. Transparency, probably can't even spell transparency, but good job there, and Frank, thank you very much and the organization out there. Really good quarter and now we've got to deliver the second quarter, folks, because our shareholders are expecting better and since they've said I sandbagged them on the upgrade, I hope they're right, but we'll see what happens after that second quarter. So everyone, you take care and I'll see you in New York next week, and pray for no snow unlike Boston a few years ago when we moved to Boston and got five feet of snow, what a heck it was and so you all take care and we'll see you next week at the Stock Exchange. Bye. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines.",

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Emerson's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. This conference is being recorded today, May 1, 2018. Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Tim Reeves, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead, sir. Tim Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you, Denise. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's second quarter 2018 results. The accompanying slide presentation is available on our website. I'll start on slide 3 with the second quarter summary. Sales in the second quarter of $4.2 billion increased 19% with underlying sales up 8% and strong growth across both of our business platforms. Demand conditions remained favorable and were consistent with our first quarter. The U.S. and China led growth and trends were favorable across all world areas. Underlying orders have trended in the 5% to 10% range that we expect to continue through the year. Profitability continues to be strong. In the base business, excluding Valves & Controls, EBIT margin was up 170 basis points on solid incremental margins. Price cost remain neutral in the quarter. GAAP EPS increased 31% to $0.76. We continue to buy back shares. In Q2, we repurchased 3.6 million shares. And in the first half we've repurchased over 11.4 million shares and returned almost $1.4 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Q2 wraps up a strong first half for Emerson. And overall, the quarter was stronger operationally than we had anticipated a few months ago. Turning to slide 4. Second quarter gross margin was up 40 basis points, excluding Valves & Controls and EBIT margin was up 170 basis points. A quick note on our first half profitability. In the first half, gross margin excluding Valves & Controls was up 100 basis points and EBIT margin was up 130 basis points driven by operating leverage, the benefits from prior-period restructuring actions and execution around normal ongoing cost reduction efforts. Price cost in the first half was approximately flat and we continue to expect a neutral price cost impact in the full year. Turning now to slide 5. From a geographic perspective, the momentum we've seen over the past few quarters continued in the second quarter with broad-based demand and favorable trends across the world areas. Mature markets were up high-single digits led by North America. Europe was flat in Q2 and in the first half, but order trends here are favorable and we expect solid growth here in the second half. Emerging markets were up high-single digits in the second quarter led by China, which continued to deliver robust growth across both business platforms. In the first half, total Emerson underlying sales were up 8%. Turning to slide 6. Total segment margins excluding Valves & Controls was up 130 basis points in Q2. And in the first half, the segment margin was up 100 basis points again excluding Valves & Controls. The acceleration of growth across our businesses has resulted in modestly higher working capital levels and we expect strong free cash flow conversion in the second half. Turning to slide 7. Automation Solutions underlying sales were up 10% in the quarter and 10% in the first half. Favorable trends continued with strong demand across process, hybrid and discrete end-markets led by North America and China. Strength in oil and gas was driven by MRO, small and midsized projects and turnaround activity. Demand in chemicals markets were supported by petrochemical and specialty chem upgrade and optimization projects. Our global power business whose markets have seen a steep decline grew net sales and orders in the first half, reflecting strong participation in plant retrofit and Greenfield investment activity. Automation Solutions segment margin was up 20 basis points and was up 240 basis points, excluding Valves & Controls. Improvement was driven by operational leverage and the benefit of prior-period restructuring actions. Our Final Control team continues to hit key milestones and the Valves & Controls business is integrating very quickly into the broader Final Control business. With Valves & Controls we are on track with synergy plans and we are seeing the margin improvement read through. Turning now to slide 8, Commercial & Residential Solutions. Underlying sales grew 4% in the quarter and 4% in the first half. In China and in broader Asia, strong demand continued in air-conditioning and refrigeration markets. Growth in North America reflected strong demand for professional tools, while air-conditioning demand slowed due to cooler weather and timing of channel inventory stocking. However, the underlying economics for air-conditioning markets remains positive and we expect solid growth in the second half. Margin decreased 10 basis points as material inflation and mix was partially offset by operational leverage, higher price realization and the benefit of prior-period restructuring actions, and aided by the divestiture of the ClosetMaid business which was sold on October of 2017. Let's turn now to slide 9, which outlines our updated full-year guidance. Please note that this framework does not include the impact of the recently announced Tools & Test acquisition. We will provide and update the guidance after the transaction close which is expected in the fiscal fourth quarter. We expect total Emerson underlying sales to grow 7% at the high end of the previous guidance range with Automation Solutions up 8% and Commercial & Residential Solutions up 5%. The GAAP EPS range is increased $0.05 at the midpoint to a new range of $3.10 to $3.20 or growth of 22% to 26% compared with the prior year. This guidance assumes a neutral price cost impact as we continue to offset material inflation with price realization and cost reduction efforts. The expected effective tax rate for 2018 is 25% to 27%. And now, please turn with me to slide 10, and I will hand the call over to Mr. David Farr. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much, Tim. I appreciate it. And, first of all, before I talk about the slide, I want to welcome everybody. And I want to thank everybody across Emerson for a tremendous quarter, the Emerson people around the world, including our new acquisitions from the Valves & Controls and the Paradigm and the Cooper-Atkins, I want to thank all those people as they've integrated very quickly and understand the core principles of Emerson. We had a very strong quarter and a very strong first half of our fiscal year. I also want to let you know that with me today I have a brand new Stan Musial autograph bat from a longtime friend and also a shareholder who figured I needed a new baseball bat given that Tim's been taking the brunt of the other baseball bats for a while and he keeps breaking them. But I do have a new Stan Musial bat with my rally monkey holding on to the handle for good luck. Now, back to the chart on Tools & Test, I wasn't here for this acquisition, but you have to understand these are two unique brands Greenlee tool and Klauke that we've wanted to acquire for many, many, many years. As you all know, I ran Ridge Tool at one time and we used to talk to the folks at Textron about these two acquisitions. These are unbelievable unique brands, very powerful brands. And like the Valves & Controls acquisition, we see unique capability of integration, unique capability of taking these brands and along with our core brands in this area here and making it much stronger and creating significant value for our shareholders. Yeah, some people might say it was an expensive acquisition, but there's not many assets like this out there. You can count on one hand, the brand recognition of assets in this space, be it Ridge Tool, be it Milwaukee, be it Greenlee, be it Klauke, be it \u2013 you can go work a couple more but there're not many brands like it. And that's why we're so unique about it. And I'm really glad that the CEO of Textron made a decision to really focus on other businesses like we did when we made our decision a couple of years ago. But very strong opportunities and growth and we really look at the leverage opportunities between some very powerful brands and creating a strong business for our customers, but also for our shareholders. And I was not able to join the phone call because I've been on the road. I was around the road \u2013 around the world for 13 days, seeing what's going on in the world of Emerson and it is going well. And I'll talk a little bit about that in a second. But first of all, I want to again say strong execution by both platforms. The emerging markets is emerging to \u2013 as we talked about it in February, I think they take a stronger role in growth in the second half of this year and going into 2019 and 2020. As I see it unfold right now I like what I see relative to some of the emerging markets. The only emerging market that we have not seen really kick into growth at this point in time is Latin America. It's been sporadic one quarter up, one quarter down. But I think that will kick in. But the world of Asia, the world of Middle East, Africa, the world of Eastern Europe all kicked in very strongly, and I see good strong growth opportunities for the next several years. As I went out and talked to customers as I was in Germany and Italy, the Middle East, Singapore, and then also the Philippines, the project business is building. As we've been talking about the small, medium-sized projects are the first one on the shoot and they continue to build along those lines, which is very, very good. And I'm really glad to see that. But now I'm starting to hear about larger projects, which are being formed and starting to be bid on, which will really solidify our growth opportunities as we move into 2019 and 2020. But the shape of the recovery is good with the U.S. clearly leading this right now. But from my perspective, we're going to see the emerging markets come in and drive faster growth versus the mature markets as we get into 2019 and 2020. Overall, both businesses are executing around the profitability, around the investments. I feel very good about the growth rates. We're separating ourselves from the pack in many, many markets like China, like the Middle East and a couple other key markets like India around the world. And I like what's happening at this point in time. Cash flow is still on track to deliver around $2.9 billion for the year. Clearly, right now our growth rate is running a tad higher than we said originally. Therefore, we have a little bit of working capital primarily around receivables as the growth has kicked in, but from my perspective nothing of a concern yet. As I look at the total year, I mean \u2013 and Tim had mentioned already in the slide, we see our growth rate around the 7% plus or minus a little bit there. We like where we are at this point in time. As I look at the Automation Solutions business, it looks like it has some upside. Commercial Res really depends on getting a stronger weather pattern, which we're starting to get right now relative to some mort and some better weather from construction. But overall, we're shaping up to have 7%, good solid 7%-plus type of underlying sales growth for the year with a good solid earnings per share in this $3.10 to $3.20 range at this point in time, excluding any of the impact of the acquisitions. For the third quarter, as we said, we see a very good underlying growth rates, somewhere in the 7% to 7.5% range. We're looking at earnings per share. And I'm telling you \u2013 I'm giving you the range but as you guys try to map out the year as we raise the guidance for the year, we see right now $0.85 plus or minus a couple of pennies, along with that 7% to 7.5% range of underlying growth. Another good progression, another good quarter. And, clearly, we're obviously seeing a pretty good fourth quarter coming at. We'll see what happens as the cycle continues in the Automation Solutions. But that's what we see at this point in time. But I'll open the floor up for questions. Overall, again, I feel I want to thank everybody for the strong execution around the world and the both platforms and the integration of the businesses we made acquisition-wise, a very good job. And we're looking forward to another solid quarter as we move into this third quarter and our fiscal year 2018. So with that, I'll open the floor up for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and answer session. Your first question will come from Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Good day, everyone. Hello, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Hello, Jeff. Good to hear from you. And hopefully, you're having a good weather. It's beautiful here in the Midwest. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Sun has finally come out. I think spring has finally arrived here on May 1, a month later. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: God, it's been a long cold wet spring here, or I guess you can't call it spring, I guess a pre-spring. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hey, I ask this question almost kind of tongue in cheek but there's a lot of people out there that are kind of saying the cycle is over and this is as good as things get. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You must have listened to catcall. You must have listened to Caterpillar phone call. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yeah. No, catcalls on this call right? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No catcalls, this call. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : So how do you feel about the longevity of the activity that's unfolding in front of you? And is there any particular thing that you are concerned about from a macro standpoint? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean, I don't think the cycle is any different than I've been talking about over the last 6 to 12 months. I think that 2018 is going to be a good year for us. I think 2019 for the automation space could be slightly better depending where we finish, Jeff. Because you know, I've always talked about, if we have a stronger 2018, that will take a little bit away from 2019, but I still see a very good 2019 based on the project business at this point in time. I'm always worried about any type of trade wars. I'm always worried about any type of confrontation in the Middle East or something like that. But right now, the customer base has the money. The pricing is staying up relative to the commodities and they need to invest. So I feel good about it. And we have a lot of great new technology coming out. The timing and the integration of Valves & Controls and that support of that organization as they've come in and leverage across what we're seeing across Emerson right now has been very, very positive for us. So I'm very optimistic. I've said that I thought that Automation Solutions could have a stronger growth year in 2019 than 2018. I still believe that. The cycle has not peaked. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Interesting. Thanks. And then just on V&C. Obviously, you gave us the margin progression ex-V&C and we've got the acquisitive effect on sales. But there is a little bit of other M&A going through Automation, now like Paradigm and the like. Could you just put a little bit of finer point on the underlying V&C margin execution in the quarter, kind of where it's at and where it's at at this point? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I'll let Tim answer that. I'll let Tim answer it because he thought this would come up and he's got the numbers here. He talked to Ram up in \u2013 but it's progressing like we thought it would. The orders are extremely strong. I just saw some orders from Europe and they're doing well. But Tim, why don't you tell him where they are progressing? Tim Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.: So the history since we closed on the business last April, it's been in the sort of 4% to 5% range and that excludes restructuring and the amortization. And so what we saw through this first quarter was kind of still in that range and we expected Q2 to be up and start to track toward the double-digit margins in Q4. And we did see that. So it was up. It's high-single digits in Q2. We expect high single digits Q3, and then we should be into those double digits Q4. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's getting harder and harder for us to be able to manage it. I mean well, we're going to try to give you an indication where it's going. It's definitely moving that way, but the integration is going and it's getting tougher and tougher. But it's progressing. Well, I mean, if you look at the overall profitability of the Automation business, if we were having problems with V&C, it's big enough to move it. The Paradigm is not big enough to move it. But right now I like, from a working capital standpoint, a sales standpoint and the profitability standpoint, we're making great progress. We got to visit a lot of sites around the world. Frank was with me. And so we got to spend some time with them. So Jeff, I think we're in the slot there right now and the business has picked back up. So our timing is pretty good in this one. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. Thanks a lot. Very solid, appreciate it. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: All the best to you, Jeff. Thank you very much. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yeah. Take care. Operator : The next question will be from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Scott. Where are you hanging out today, New York or somewhere? Where are you going? Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : New York. It's where I hang my hat. But, no comment. Anyways, Dave, you said you were... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: There is nothing wrong with New York. I'm from New York and Frank's from New York. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Why don't you pay our taxes? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Well, I don't. I can't change \u2013 I pay my fair share. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Aren't you one of those states that pay half the taxes and collect more than you pay. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's really tough when you cross the 50% pay level. I know that, it's a hard one for all of us to handle. I'm not quite there. You might want to move to a lower tax state. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Well, I would take 50% of what you make Dave, but 50% of what I make may not do much for you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: What is this? Get live. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : All right. I'll focus on work here for a sec. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. Let's focus on this. Okay. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : You said you were just in the Mideast and your orders were, or your sales actually were pretty darn strong. And have we officially seen a turn? Do they have any money over there for projects? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. They have turned. And it's been turning now for three or four months. And I was little bit more cautious late last year it's turned. The money is coming. You got money in Saudi, you've got money in Kuwait. We're seeing money coming out of Africa now, even the North Africa. They're having to put money back in. For them to get the revenue, they have to invest and get the oil and the gas out. We're seeing Qatar starting to put some money back in. So the answer is, yes, and our KOB3 and then KOB2 business right now is very good. So they're putting the money back into repairing and upgrading and trying to get little bit more out from productivity. And the bigger projects are coming, and the bidding, then that will again be coming down the road, but very active right now. And I think that we have a good couple of years here, I think, at this point in time. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Okay. And, Dave, one of the things that got us more positive on your story, it was just the utility market and Ovation. You'd made some positive comments about utility, but give us a sense, I mean it feels like that market's been dead for many, many years. Is there some real legs behind an upgrade cycle, automation side and the utility side globally? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: So when you break it down globally, if you look at the emerging markets, there's a lot of new capacity and upgrades going on and so we're seeing that. But in the mature markets, primarily North America, what we're seeing is enhancement investments into the current capacity. There's not a lot of new capacity going into the U.S. right now, but they're investing in trying to make their facilities more productive. And given our installed base in North America of all the power plants, we have a very good inside run there. And then also, with our new embedded PLC, which we're going after, that's a very active products \u2013 project for us inside the utility marketplace too. So right now, we're seeing positive orders, as we did last year in North America and on a global basis. We have continued to invest in this space. We have continued to make the necessary new product investments. And I think that a lot of our competitors have been backing off. And I think they're giving us an opportunity here that \u2013 and you know me, Scott. You've known me for a long time. I seize opportunities. And we're \u2013 I was up in Pittsburgh last week and spent a whole day with them. And we're looking at how we continue to widen the gap of our penetration around the world. And I think that \u2013 I feel good about the next couple of years in our power industry. And it's a very \u2013 it drives a lot of other core products at the same. So every \u2013 I mean, from a transmitters to control valve and instrumentation, it really drives other good businesses for us. So I'm more optimistic than you are. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Good. Good luck, Dave. I'll pass it on. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thanks. Operator : The next question will be from Steve Winoker of UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good afternoon, Dave. How are you? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Steve. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : It's good to hear your conviction to the cycle. That's great. Hopefully, you offset the negativity. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I've been around a while and I've been through three cycles. This cycle has not ended. Period. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Right, I get a brand new baseball bat. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Now, I'm not trying to talk to you on numbers or anything. I'd just say, it's not ended. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Dave, on the cash flow side, so you obviously addressed it in your comments, but I want to maybe hone in there a little bit on your conviction around hitting that $1.5 billion plus, I guess, it's $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in the second half. You took the guidance on cash flow down just a little bit, a tick. It's growth related. You got the working capital moves. You guys are great on cash normally. I guess, any risks that we should be aware of in you making that number? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. I mean, not at all. I think that the conversion rate will move around based on the growth of earnings coming up and what we're seeing. If we're going to have, as we took the growth rate up a tad for the whole corporation, as I've talked and I openly talk about it, once we start crossing around at 6.8%-plus range, it's a tougher line for us to continue to take \u2013 keep that working capital totally, totally in check. So from my perspective, we can deliver the hard cash and yet the commercial rate is going to be a little lower, because the earnings, it's just the way the cycle is going to be and the timing of say, the September sales. So I don't have a \u2013 I'm not less convicted \u2013 I feel good about the cash flow. If I grow faster \u2013 let's say, we grew 7.5% for the whole year that will \u2013 puts a lot more pressure on us. But I'll take the growth in the sales, I'll take the growth in earnings and we'll get the cash off \u2013 we'll get the working capital off the balance sheet when things slow down a little bit. So it's \u2013 we're in that cusp right now Steve, of these growth rates where we actually have to put some money on the balance sheet versus when we take it off. So that's \u2013 we're in that fine line right now, but I wouldn't worry about our cash flow. I mean, the cash is good. It's just \u2013 we're growing a little faster, which is good. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Right, a good problem to have. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I'll give you a choice, more cash or less growth. What do you want? Give me a choice. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. Dave I want both. All right? Come one, you know that. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Do you really want to run a business? I agree, because I want both too. But I also have to be realistic. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah, yeah. Well, just you're hitting it out of the park right? So pricing versus inflation... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: My new bat. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : ...you've been worried about this? Pricing versus inflation, you've been worried about that. Are you less worried... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I don't worry about them. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : ...these days or are you going to be green? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think that right now we're under control. We're under control. I would say right now we're probably flat. I mean, as we said all year long, we're flat. I always felt that it'd be slightly plus or minus a couple of million dollars in this, we're flat. The whole issue around the tariffs, around the disruption, around the steel pricing, the prices ran up, they've drifted back down. We're all out there working. It's part of the reason we're probably moving products around the world a little bit right now trying to get position for this. I worry about it more in 2019, Steve than I do now. Because I think we have to make sure we understand where things are trending and then we're going to have to get the pricing action in place. In certain cases, we're putting double prices in this year. We're having to tweak because of material costs. But I think we've been waiting for this upturn in inflation for about four years, after having five years of negative. And so now we're moving pretty quickly. So I think we got this under control. I mean, we're going to be plus or minus a couple of million dollars. I'm not too worried about it. But there's a wildcard out there. And all of a sudden tariffs come in and we start seeing kind of knock-on effect on tariffs. That could cause problems for all of us in the industrial world. But right now, it's under control, but it's a wildcard that I worried about, to be honest. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : All right. That's my two questions. I'll hand it on. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: All the best to you, Steve. You take care my friend. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : You too. Yeah, you too. Operator : The next question will be from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I've got my rally monkey here, so don't be mean Tusa. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not going to be mean. I'm not. I'm not that kind of guy just calling as I see it, Dave. I always just try and call it as I see it. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Well, I'm thinking about getting a new dog to just keeping you at bay. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So just to be clear on that power commentary, you talked about you're taking market share. I mean the big installed base of market share... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I didn't say taking market share. I said, I think people have walked away from the marketplace. I didn't say \u2013 but I think we're doing pretty well, yeah. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Well, obviously, if they're walking away from the marketplace and you guys are winning business, that means you're taking share. And it's \u2013 I mean, my understanding that most of the controls are kind of like OEM related. I mean this is not something that Rockwell necessarily has a huge presence in especially in the U.S. So like I would assume that the share gains are coming from some of the legacy OEM controllers here in North America, at least that's what we've seen in the channel from meeting with your guys at power gen. Is that the correct assumption? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, that is correct assumption. But the other thing out there the aisle into automation and power plants are out there and so we're going after that. And so we have parts of a power plant where it's been a PLC-type structure and a skid. We now have our OCC 100, which we're able to embed and hook up to our control system. We're bringing a lot more cyber security into play here. So there's a lot places that the power companies are investing. And we've been positioning ourselves from just being a control system to have a much broader product offering. So therefore, we can serve these power plants. And we're actually investing in our organization to go out to power plants where a lot of companies are backing away from that. And on a global basis, you're still seeing power \u2013 original power going in. You're seeing power plants. You're going to see enormous amount of power plants going in, in Asia over the next five to 10 years. So right now, in North America, we're winning in a good way. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. It's good to be the control systems guy in that scenario. On climate, what's going on in the U.S.? I mean, all these guys put up pretty good numbers all the OEMs. I think they talked down a bit the second quarter given weather comps. How are you kind of explaining the channel dynamics there? Is this kind of \u2013 Goodman is the only one we really haven't seen this quarter. Is that kind of a customer-specific timing dynamic reflected in your numbers? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's more of a timing. And when them ramping up the new production on the A/C unit system and versus the heating. It was a very cold wet Spring early cycle. And so we didn't have an early ramp up like we had a little bit more last year. So I mean it's more of a timing issue for us. As you know, we're not always in sync with the OEMs, the manufacturers here. So right now, the function for us is we need some good production and we need some good building going on in the housing markets or our residential piece will be kind of low-single digits this year. But I'm not too worried about it right now. I think that a lot of it is \u2013 will keep coming. If I get into May and we get down to EPG and I'm starting to see that things are still weak on it, then we're going to have a tough year in North America. Fortunately, our European business, fortunately our Asia business is still going well. Fortunately our other \u2013 the other markets, the refrigeration market, the client \u2013 those markets are going well. But the one market that has been weak over the last couple of months has been our North America A/C. And so hopefully we'll see a little heat come in here and a little dry weather and we'll see some orders pop in. But that's what we see right now. I'm not too concerned about it. We've had this before Steve. You know that. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. Okay. Take care. See you at EPG, I guess. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: See you at EPG. Yeah, thank you very much, Steve. Operator : The next question will be from Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Please go ahead. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good afternoon, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Rob. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Two questions. One just in terms of the cycle, particularly on process, could you just kind of walk through kind of what you thought the trough was? Just give us a little bit of a history lesson. And how long this cycle could really go here, just given what we're seeing in underlying oil prices and demand? I mean is it fair to say that we could see this go for several years beyond what may be more early mid-cycle for an underlying economy? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: So it peaked globally around 2014. It troughed in mid/early 2017. It was \u2013 as you all know, we had a very good run. It went on for several, several years. We had very high levels and then it dropped pretty hard as people cut way back. What's different in the cycle is because I think people are going to be very, very cautious about committing new capital for new production from the oil and gas and areas like that. But they're going to invest in the core business they already have if they already have some wells out there how to expand that without going out and spending for the big, big finds and things like that. And what I see right now is people are being much more cautious and they're going to try and incrementalize this a little bit, adding a little bit of a time to the point that one of them may break and say okay, I've got to put more money into it. But it's \u2013 I mean, that's why I think that we can have a good solid two years here with 2019 being pretty good. But right now, my visibility in the cycle is solid at least three to four years. And from the perspective I think there's been some underinvestment and the question is, does the demand stay there in the world area for the energy? And does the price of energy stay at a good price like it is right now? So it's hard to go beyond three years, Rob. But I see two solid years and I see a good third year. And that's about as far as I can see at this point in time. The key thing for me is going back to the large projects are starting to form. So as I see these large projects starting to build out around the world that gives me a little bit more indication where the cycle is going to go to. So we'll know more about this as they get out towards the end of the calendar year this year as I look at the project business we have going out and I see bigger and bigger projects coming at us. But right now, I like what I see, and it's shaping up. It's good for us because the small and medium ones are easier to execute on and they're typically better profitability. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: On that note, with the integration of Valves & Controls, could you just talk about how the progress has been particularly on two specific things? One is the trade working capital and the intended cash and what the trajectory is there? And then further the potential revenue synergies from getting back into Kingdom and some others in the world where perhaps you were under-penetrated or under-indexed when it was in Pentair's hands? And what the opportunity and the trajectory could be there as kind of a sweetener to the integration? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: The working capital is happening. I mean, on the Final Control business, and its Ram and his team, right now, they're doing extremely well with this integration. I would say a couple of places we've had in the Automation where we've had tougher working capital challenges, but Ram's team is doing very good job of getting this out and cleaning it up. And we feel good about that. The integration is going well. We're very deep in the process right now of exiting a business we had in Europe, which we knew we're always going to exit. It's going to cost us some money. We're in the process of getting that done. Hopefully, we'll get it done before this fiscal year and maybe before the end of this quarter. Relative to the project work and relative to the integration of sales that is actually going much faster than we anticipated. And as we've said in February, I think that's been one of the pleasant surprises of the organizations of the Pentair Valves & Controls business and then our Automation business coming together. And we're getting acceptance and we're hiring people to start working jointly together. So I thought that maybe we would have a little bit more of a pause this year on growth and I think we're going to have a better growth mode out of this \u2013 the Final Control business seriously than I thought. And I think a lot of that's going to be tied around the co-selling and the synergies. Relative to the Kingdom and Aramco, we've been \u2013 the Aramco to their credit has been working extremely hard to get \u2013 they have to go visit all the facilities and they have to sign off on all the facilities. As I look at the progress because I'm going to try to meet with the CEO of Aramco next week. They pretty much have visited every facility now. And we're now getting down to anything they've asked us to clean up and do like that. So we're starting to get bids. So I think we're going to see more of an impact on that in 2019, which again is a little bit faster because Aramco historically is pretty slow at getting back out. So net-net, great integration on the costs, working capital, but pleasantly positively surprised on underlying growth rate in orders, which is great to see from the perspective of Ram and his whole team around the world. I'm very pleased with that. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for the answer. See you at EPG. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: See you. Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Julian. How are you doing? Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Very good. Thank you. Maybe just a first question on Europe. Yeah, that have been sluggish for you and many others in terms of fixed asset investment for a while. The soft data there looked a lot better for 12 months. Now that's started to slow in your own numbers in terms of orders in Automation for example are pretty sluggish still. So I just wondered, do you still believe there will be a fixed asset investment recovery in Europe, or are you're still going to think maybe that is pushed out. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I feel very strongly. Julian, I feel very strong that we will deliver 5% growth in Europe this year, underlying sales growth this year. I see the projects. I see the winning going on. It took a while. I think that on the commercial res sides, we've been doing pretty well there and they're doing well. They're pretty well in line for that. The Automation \u2013 and we were there and Frank was with me and we were talking about this. We had a European review. We see the projects. And so I firmly believe that the orders are coming and we're going to see this, around a 5% underlying growth rate in Europe. It just, it took them longer for it to gear back up. They had some very strong first half 2017 Eastern Europe projects that we won and did well on and it's just taking longer for us to get geared back up in the Western Europe part. I agree that the overall economy, the numbers are slowing down a little bit. But I don't think it's going to impact what we see going for both 2018 and 2019. I think the investments are starting to happen. The money is starting to flow. And so I think the industrial world in particular has struggled this quarter in Europe, in Western Europe, but I think it's going to start \u2013 the investments are going to start flowing back out, and I feel good about the orders and sales at this point in time. I could eat my words on this, but that's, after meeting with this team and going through a battle with them for about a day and a half, I feel good about it. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understood. And then my follow-up would just be around the, I guess the sort of orders trajectory within Automation. I mean, is most of the strength you're seeing in that March figure for example, that's still MRO related, I guess. When you're trying to think about the larger projects, what's your latest view on when you think those might start to hit the orders rate rather than just being part of conversations and quotations activity? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We'll start seeing some happen this quarter. We'll start having some bookings coming in on some good sized projects, which will create a lumpiness in our order pattern. The reason our order pattern has been pretty stable for the Automation business for the last several months is because we're still booking the small/medium-sized projects which are good, but we're starting to book our bid and win and also lose larger projects which I think we'll start seeing them being booked in the third quarter, some in the fourth quarter. Again, most of that is not going to help us this year, but it's going to help us build the 2019 which builds a stronger 2019, which I feel will be there. The other thing I see in 2019 is I see the emerging markets playing a key role for us and that's why I feel good about 2019 in the Automation business. But you're going to start seeing some \u2013 I wouldn't be surprised if you don't seeing some spikes in some orders and some project wins here in this quarter. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Take care, Julian. Operator : The next question will be from Gautam Khanna of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks. Good quarter. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Gautam. Thank you very much. Boy, two quarters in a row I get to talk to you. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah, yeah. No, it's all good. So in fiscal 2019, I know you're not guiding fiscal 2019, but. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Definitely not guiding fiscal 2019. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Right. But just to be clear. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I'm still kind of one of these crazy CEOs that will talk about even more than two quarters or two months. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: No, that's right. I appreciate that actually. 2019, obviously you're going to have some lift in margins at the Valves & Controls business. But you are facing this mix dynamic with more project activity growing presumably at Automation. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: So just wanted, should we expect incremental margins at Automation Solutions to dip down? Or do you think they can stay in the mid 30s as we transition the mix? Unknown Speaker : (41:26) David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Doing the logic, and connecting the dots, you just put out there Gautam, which are very relevant dots for this connection. I firmly believe the margin pressure will be in this 30% to 35% range. This year, I think we're going to be probably a little, around closer to 35%. So I think that what's going to happen is the pressure will be to push that margin down because of the project business. And then what we have to make sure is that we manage the incremental investments as we grow. And that's what the challenge is going to be for 2019, because the projects will be kicking in. Some of the MRO business will probably slowing down. I'm hoping we'll have some, still some good mix in North America investments going on. So we maybe have a better mix going our way. But that's going to be the pressure point we have. And then clearly, we're going to be pushing real hard on V&C to get that double-digit margin that we exit 2018 with to move it up quickly as possible so it help offset some of that dilution. But that's the game we're going to be facing there. But I still feel good about the margin progression that we laid out getting to that 19% that we, I think it was 2020, 2021? I still feel good about that. But the gain next year is exactly what you said, the projects come in, we got to start figuring out how we squeeze as best as we can to maintain the margin improvement record as we go forward. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. But north of 30% incremental, is it still kind of stable for next year? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. For all the Automation guys out on the phone or listening to this call, Mike Train and team north of 30%. Gautam says it. You have to deliver. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Right, right. Of course. And then - David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Ignore the CEO of Emerson, but talk to Gautam. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Right, right. I was going to say Latin America's still lagging. I was wondering, maybe if you could parse which \u2013 I thought we were getting some strength in Mexico and else in Brazil. But I wanted to know like what specifically is kind of holding that region back? Are you seeing any pockets of strength within Latin America? And what sort of is the last one to come back. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, we are. We actually, last quarter, we saw good progress in Mexico, down in Chile and Argentina. This quarter, Brazil kicked in and Mexico dropped off. Our Mexican customer base has struggled a little bit relative to some projects and some business and small projects. So this quarter Mexico hurt us. So I've gone from \u2013 I was a believer they were going to come through to now I'm starting to doubt it again for a while here until this election gets done. But right now, it's Mexico's the one that held us back. The rest of the region, be it Brazil, be it Chile, be it Argentina, they're doing much better. So if we can get Mexico back online and growing again, right now, I'd say maybe fourth quarter we'll see some growth return to that marketplace. But that's the last of the global region, although our emerging markets turned back up. Fortunately, it's not the largest. I mean, we have other markets much larger than they are now. But it's still, I'd like to see them all come back into sync. And I think it will because there's been under investments down there. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Appreciate the color. Thanks a lot, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Take care, Gautam. All the best to you. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Deane. Good to hear from you. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, and I like the choice of the Stan Musial bat too. Stan the Man. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: He was a very nice investor and I won't mention his name. I've known him from a long, long, long time. He is a close friend. And he knows I love baseball bat. He also knows I like Stan Musial a lot. And I have lot of autographed stuff from Stan. And it's sitting here with my rally monkey and he is swinging it hard right now. So I appreciate that. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good to hear. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: What can I do for you today, Deane? Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So hopefully, you can expand on the comments on China being robust for Automation. And so to see and hear the comment strong across process that's not surprising given the context of everything on this call and even hybrid. But in your answer, you can also touch on where strength is in discrete markets. We don't often hear you talk about that. So maybe some color, or maybe some applications if you could? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: So from our perspective in the downturn, we worked \u2013 in the sort of a global downturn, we worked very, very hard to go after \u2013 continue to go after the mid-tier Chinese customers in the chemical area, the refining area, the pharmaceutical area and the natural gas area. And we are seeing them investing in a big way at this point in time. So when we're going in we're selling \u2013 and also the power area from the standpoint they're upgrading their power systems, to make them cleaner. So we're seeing broad investments in our marketplace around \u2013 the markets we have chemical area, the mid-tier markets and they're taking our total package, be it systems, instrumentation, they're taking discrete products with them. We're seeing investments going on in the pharmaceutical right now as China is investing in their own pharmaceutical industry. And we are continuing to see very strong investments in refining as China is trying to become more of a self-sufficient on refining the finished product and for their own marketplace. But across the board, if you look at the industries and we just had a review in Singapore on what's going on in China right now and Dominic and he is doing a great job. He is the Head of \u2013 President for us in China. Most of the markets are very strong across everything we serve at this point in time. And it's a lot of the smaller emerging players and our end-customer base that are investing in the space. And they're investing in smaller type of projects, but we're winning on broad-based projects, which is good. And the reason that discrete is coming through is because pharmaceutical, some of the chemical and some of the power area, we're starting to see some of our efforts of new product generation is starting to have a pretty good penetration. So when you grow 20% in a quarter in China in both businesses, you know you're doing something right. And that's what we did in the last quarter. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good to hear. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: And I think we're going to have a very good \u2013 I think \u2013 I talked about having growth this year, most likely around 10% to 12%. I'm now looking at China being very strong this year, being north of 15% for Emerson. And because we have \u2013 we've really invested in people, we've invested in innovation and we're really pushing hard in this market space right now and our customers are liking what they see from us. So we're in a good zone and I'm sure people are going to start gunning for us here real soon. But I like where we are at this point in time. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. And that 15% is for fiscal 2018? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Correct. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. And then, just a follow-up on the Valves & Controls question. You hinted that there is a divestiture coming and I know you can't give a lot of specifics, but I'd be interested in, kind of, directionally how material is that business to the overall Valves & Controls? And will you benefit from this addition by a subtraction? Is it a lower margin business? So will that help you get to your double-digit target? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It will help us more next year. Let's put it that way. It is a small business. You're talking less than $20 million in size, and you're talking about business that breaks even. And it's \u2013 and we've had \u2013 this has been in the market from day one, and the technology and product line, it's not interested \u2013 in the marketplace, we're not interested. We have a couple more that we've been working on where we're trying to sell them. And \u2013 so this one will be done. And we'll probably get a little bit of help this year, all honestly, Deane, but it's going to help us more next year from the standpoint as we start running the year into 2019, it will help give us a nice margin, because we won't have that dilutive impact in there. But it's \u2013 that's very \u2013 it's very small. It's not that big. But, overall, what I'm really hoping to see is, when it clears, and see the business is growing this year, when I thought we might not grow this year, we may actually go backwards. So that's the good sign right now of the integration process. But small divestitures that we have to deal with and we're hopefully getting them all done this year or early first \u2013 the first quarter of next year. But Frank and his team are working hard on it right now. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. See you in Sarasota. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much. Thank you, Deane. Operator : The next question will be from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Rich. How are you doing? You're in St. Louise today, you're in the Midwest? Where are you hanging out today? Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I'm in Baltimore. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Baltimore. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Still in Baltimore, yeah. Yeah. Hanging in here, wearing my armor suit, so. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Question on cash from V&C, unlocking it, so referencing some of Rob's question earlier. So couple hundred million dollars was kind of the target over a multi-year timeframe. But where are you right now? How do you feel about that in terms of pulling out any sooner? And any thoughts around timing around it, pulling that in? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I don't think \u2013 I mean, I think our goal is north of $200 million in this by 2020. I don't think we're going be able to go any faster, Rich, because, right, we're going through right now is, I have a lot of pressure on Ram and his team. I think we're going to get over $50 million this year. The goal for me is really to get their manufacturing regionalized and globalized, which is a new concept for them. And that's important to me. So I want to be able to manufacture. Our business in Asia right now, and China has taken off, and they don't manufacture the product in Asia. They ship it around the world. So my focus right now is, okay, guys, give me the manufacturing strategy with investments we have to make for the next couple of years, so we can localize. And that allows me then to get \u2013 to be a little more aggressive on the working capital. I mean, we'll get the $200 million out of it by 2020, but the issue really \u2013 the gold mine for me is to be more regionally located, manufacturing located, which allows me to run with less working capital. And that would make a much bigger number on a combined basis down the road, which is that's my goal from that statement, from a cost and just the working capital basis. But I feel good about it. I mean, we're going to end up getting north of $200 million off this and we're going to do it in a very systematic approach. And I think we're getting to cost structure and the competitive nature and the sales force is working hard. And now we're talking \u2013 we talked in Italy, Frank was with us, we're talking about new products and innovation for the first time in a long time with these guys. And so we're working to help each other try to accelerate innovation, which is something that you know that's a mantra of with inside Emerson. We work very, very hard at innovation. And so this is something I -they're exciting me with the concepts and opportunities for me right now and not just from working capital, but just from growth opportunities, which will be great to see. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Right. So it sounds like there's some tail, even some tail opportunity beyond 2020 with regards to working capital though. It's just going to be kind of grind it out. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, I think so Rich. From my perspective, they are running around 50%. I want to get them down to 30%. In reality, I think that Ram's business should be thinking about low 20s. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Right. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: And so \u2013 but this was going to take a more regional manufacturing approach and that will take time. But that's a lot of dollars when you start thinking about it. You take that percentage of sales. And so that's the way I think of the model I see for these guys, if they want investment, this is why I want back from them. But I know it's going to take me capital, which I'm willing to put in. But if I can run that business in the low 20s would trade working capital on a global basis with better margins, I'm going to create value for our shareholders and our customers too. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Right. And then early returns on Paradigm; I saw some interesting stuff then at OTC and with regards to some of the software and folding that into the system and whatnot. What's been \u2013 has it expanded share of wallet early on here or what's the early read? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Not much has changed. I think this one's probably 12 months out. This one is, you do need to \u2013 going back to my comment on one of the earlier questions about the bigger projects, this is where you need bigger projects where they start investing in bigger chunks of software and those are still to come. I mean, what they're going on right now is they're looking at existing fields, existing investments. So that's only small amounts of investments going on. What we're looking for is to gear up, and it's okay, let's go look at a new location and really do some more software work. So I would say that one is going to be more helpful for us in 2019 and 2020 when the bigger projects come, but still doing okay. And then it gives us time to get integration underway. And we had an organization session last week, talking about some new teams and some new ways we want to manage this business. So Paradigm, the timing is good. And we'll make good money in this one over the long-term. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. See you in a few weeks. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thanks very much, Rick. I look forward to seeing you at EPG. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. Operator : The next question is from Simon Toennessen of Berenberg. Please go ahead. Simon Toennessen - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Simon. Simon Toennessen - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): My first question is on Automation Solutions in Asia. Obviously, very strong China numbers, you had again there. But it seems, Asia grew 7%, which is probably mostly China. So can you talk a bit, what's holding you back in Asia ex-China, and how you see that panning out in the second half? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Our Asia businesses grew a solid single digit outside of China. And I mean, China is important, but I mean, it's still \u2013 it's not \u2013 it's probably only half of our business if that all right now. I mean, I couldn't tell at the top of my head. Historically, it's around anywhere between 45% and 52%. So they're grabbing numbers for me Simon, so I can make sure I'm not \u2013 yeah so \u2013 we had good \u2013 first half growth is single-digit type of business for us good growth. What's holding us back primarily is the initial investments are just starting to happen in Southeast Asia and Australia. So Australia had gone through a very difficult time period and they're just starting to invest. So that's \u2013 the two weaker markets we're seeing right now are Southeast Asia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Australia/New Zealand. And so what we're starting to see is that's starting to pick back up. And I would expect us to see that moving into a solid single digit, which is normal for a mature \u2013 the more mature emerging market for us. So that's what's holding us back right now but the projects, the business is starting to happen. And I would say they're going to see a stronger second half than they did in the first half. And I expect China to hold in there very nicely for us Simon. Simon Toennessen - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Got it, Dave. And the second question on C&RS in China. Obviously, again a strong quarter. Can you maybe give us a bit more color on the development of the heat pumps business and how you're seeing that for fiscal 2018? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: The heat pump markets it's pretty strong. I think we're now on our seventh or eighth double-digit growth China business for Commercial Residential. That is a good record for us where you have seven straight quarters. And I think that will probably have eight or nine. So what's going on right now? What we're starting to see is it's starting to move over into the industrial marketplace, the heat pump versus the coal or versus the gas and starting to move into what I'd call the commercial marketplace. So the first wave has been around homes or the consumer marketplace. Now, it's starting to move into the industrial space and it's starting to move into the commercial space. And we're also starting to see where some potentially some hot water space where they're heating water for the industrial applications or restaurants. So we're starting to see the application of the government is trying to encourage companies to get away from coal, try to get away from heating oil to either to heat or warm water. And we're now starting to see growth starting to happen outside the residential market. So that's why this is sustained a little bit longer and we're encouraged by that. And we're hoping this will take hold as we leave this year so we can have growth in 2019. Because clearly after eight or nine good solid double-digit growth quarters in Asia, or China for these guys we're going to have some really difficult comparisons. So we're trying to drive a broader marketplace right now Simon. And we're the only one that can do this because of the size of our compression and our sizes, electronics and scale capabilities here. So, so far, it's going well. I'm going to be there in June. I'm going to a couple of sites and I'm going to do a site review in Xuzhou. I'm hoping to see some of these new products and some of those market expansion going well and (59:00) and his team are doing a great job in trying to get this to the new markets. We've got to get away from just the consumer, the individual homes to the industrial and to the commercial space, which is starting to happen. Simon Toennessen - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Very helpful. Thanks a lot, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much, Simon. All the best. Hope to see you soon. Operator : The next question will be from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good afternoon, guys. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Joe. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So Dave, maybe just talk about capital deployment a little bit. When tax reform got passed you were one of the few CEOs to talk about additional CapEx investment, so I was curious to see if there was any update there on internal projects? And then secondly just on the M&A side, obviously there Greenlee-Klauke acquisition recently. Be curious like how the pipeline is going today, what you're seeing perhaps on the process side, whether there's any opportunities there. Any color there would be great. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good. So as we talked about, I did come out and I've talked to my board about this a lot on the capital allocation. Given our balance sheet, given the cash flow generation and the benefit of the tax rate for us as we get into 2019 and 2020, we have obviously tremendous flexibility here. So from our perspective right now, our share repurchase program, we're going to be looking at $1 billion this year in our fiscal year. From a capital spending standpoint, we took it up and we're targeting to get up towards \u2013 what is it Frank? $575 million. I think that no more increase to that. I mean, I think that's right now, that's where we are at this point in time. It could slip a quarter or two, but we're ramping up. And as I talked earlier, we're trying to encourage investments relative to our globalization standpoint. So we want to invest capital to become more productive and faster and more efficient. So we're going to keep doing this in the next couple years. At the same time, this year, I mean right now, Frank are we close to $2 billion? Where are we sitting on acquisitions at this point in time? We have $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion? I firmly believe that we have opportunities this year Joe to get over $2 billion. We do have a couple we're working on it right now in the automation space. So we're trying to frontload this. As we talked about trying to get certain amount of acquisitions done incremental, bolt-on acquisitions done within the couple years, the first three years, we're trying to get them as close as possible to give us a chance to work them. We are seeing opportunities for companies like the Textron situation where their boards make the decision to refocus the company. We're seeing more and more opportunities like that out there. And we're starting to see some initial assets being shown within the Baker Hughes GE business. And so I think the opportunities are out there for us. We're going to have a couple good years of acquisitions, but they're very much focused on bolt-ons and I would say majority of them will still be in the automation space, even though we've made two good acquisitions in the commercial residential space. But our best opportunities right now continue to be in the automation and our allocation. As we talked about it, I'd like to put as much acquisition to work and the bolt-ons and the incremental acquisition opportunities versus just share repurchase. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: No, that's super helpful, Dave. I guess my one follow on. If you go back to the Textron acquisition, I had some familiarity with that asset. And right now, like clearly the margins aren't where they need to be. And I'm just curious, when you think about maybe Greenlee specifically, what is it about your channel or your go to market, maybe footprint optimization that's going to allow you to get the margins to be at a much more sustainable and higher level? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We are much more of intense company relative to footprint optimization than Textron was. And from our standpoint, I mean I'm running this business and being internally involved with this, the business internally right now. There's no reason why the Greenlee and Klauke couldn't run better. I just think they need to optimize the manufacturing. They need to optimize the investments that are already there. It's not going to be necessarily the channel per se. We do have some channel leverage. I just feel that we can run this business a much better way than they ran it from an operational standpoint and it's right into our wheelhouse, which is what we're good at. I also think they have some businesses in there they should not be in and they're not the leaders in and we're going to quickly evaluate what we're going to do with those businesses. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That makes sense. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We've got Frank over here worried about that because, but I'm just telling you what I think. I mean, I know what's inside that and I think we have some opportunities to tune it better and make them \u2013 I mean, make sure they're worth being in. That's what I'm saying. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Makes sense. Thanks, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much, Joe. Operator : The next question will be from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good afternoon, Dave. Thanks for running longer. Appreciate it. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay Andy, you're my last question. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks for running a little longer today. I appreciate it. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Well I went just to make sure could I harass you Andrew. That's why I mean, I saw in the queue and said I got to get up and harass Andrew a little bit, because he doesn't like me right now. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I understand. I welcome it. I welcome it. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So let me ask you about Commercial & Residential Solutions in the context of your margin performance. You had mentioned for the company relatively flat price versus cost. Margins were down, slight bad year over year, but you had the cause of the divestitures, a tailwind. So maybe talk about what was the impact from inflation or mix. You talked about slightly weaker U.S. residential. Are you investing more in the business? And how should we think about margin moving forward? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We are definitely investing more in the business right now. We are investing in some next generation technologies that are going to be hitting here in the U.S. and also hitting very heavily in Europe in the next couple years. So we've ramped up some investments around technology, some innovation. As you know, the space from the commercial standpoint, there's going to be some new regulations coming to play and we have to be ahead of that from the standpoint of offering a solution to our customer. And if we do that, then we win that space. And then we win that space for quite some time and we're trying to add more value to that. So the actual value proposition is higher for us. On the price cost business within the commercial, residential, we're basically off a quarter or two right now, so. And this space we're being squeezed a little bit, but I know that we will, within two quarters we'll get that back and back in line. We trade back and forth with \u2013 from our customer base. We go back and forth on this issue. So I think that we're getting closer, but we'll be under the pressure for the next quarter in this space too, it's hurt us a little bit. But it's not a big number but I just know it's a negative pressure not a positive pressure and so \u2013 from that perspective. And the other thing is just from the mix within our global businesses where Asia is a good business, but it's not nearly as profitable let's say our U.S. business or our European business. So we have a lot of \u2013 some also mix going on. But I'm not going to complain at the level of profitably. We're still going to raise this margin up over the next couple of years, but it's going to come from the investments and the growth of these new technologies not by driving a ton of cost out. We're continuing to optimize it but I really want to drive a little bit faster growth and drive a faster mix towards that profitability. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah, that's helpful, Dave. And then Automation Solutions orders, you talked about March has still been good. You told us not to be concerned last quarter when they do slow a little. But you told us on this call that large projects could start to kick in sooner rather than later. So are you still thinking about 5% to 10% range is sort of right for the year? And any indication on how April looks at this point? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I don't have any April numbers at this point. But the Automation Solutions numbers is really holding in there solid \u2013 a very solid 7% right now. And I would expect a couple of months. I mean, if we start getting larger projects as I mentioned earlier that could pop up towards that 10% range. Again, starting to get tougher comps, but the orders are holding in there such we feel very good about this 7% range for the whole year for all of Emerson. But I like where we sit right now. The trend lines are ticking up a little bit and on both businesses which is a good sign. And so as we get into EPG, I'm going to try to give you guys a little bit more color down at EPG of what I see after \u2013 we'll have April on-board, we'll have the early indication in May and we'll see what's going on here in the U.S. But, right now, the trend lines are going the right way and that's why we felt good about taking that number up to 7% underlying growth at the high end. And I'm hoping that Automation Solutions does a little bit better too in the second half this year. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Appreciate it, Dave. See you at EPG. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. With that, I'm going to wrap up. I want to thank everybody. Again, I want to thank all the Emerson people, all employees around the world for their effort. And I also want to thank the shareholders joining us today for this call. Again, a very good second quarter, a very solid first half this year. And now we just have to deliver the second half of this year. But as we look at the third quarter, we're looking somewhere \u2013 again, I'll repeat it, 7% to 7.5% underlying sales growth. We're looking at our earnings of around $0.85, plus or minus a couple of pennies. That's what it looks like to us right now. And I really can't call it any closer than that. But it's again another good solid quarter for us. And hopefully that will continue as we move into the fourth quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you Mr. Farr.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Emerson's Third Quarter Investor Conference Call. During today's presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. This conference is being recorded today, August 7, 2018. Emerson's commentary in responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Tim Reeves, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead, sir. Timothy Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much, Rocco. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Train, Executive President, Emerson Automation Solutions; Bob Sharp, Executive President, Emerson Commercial & Residential Solutions. Welcome to Emerson's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Please follow along in the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Let's start with the third quarter summary on slide 3. Sales in the quarter of $4.5 billion increased 10% with underlying sales up 8%. Demand conditions remained favorable and trailing three-month underlying orders continue to trend in the 5% to 10% range with June orders up 9%. Profitability improved across all metrics with gross margin up 220 basis points and EBIT margin up 180 basis points. Price/cost was slightly positive in the quarter. GAAP EPS was $1.12, including a $0.24 tax benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding this benefit, EPS was $0.88, up 40% compared with the prior year. Q3 cash flow was very strong. Free cash flow of $804 million is 18% of sales and free cash flow conversion was over 110% in the quarter. We've continued to buy back shares. In Q3, we repurchased 3.7 million shares. Year-to-date, we've repurchased over 15 million shares for a total of $1 billion and we've returned over $1.9 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Turning to slide 4, third quarter gross margin was up 220 basis points. This improvement includes a tailwind from prior year Valves & Controls purchase accounting charges. This tailwind was partially offset by timing of the V&C acquisition, which closed in late April last year, resulting in two months of dilution from the acquisition last year versus three months this year. On a comparable basis, that is, excluding the impact of the prior-year purchase accounting charge and the additional month of V&C dilution in the current year, gross margin was up 180 basis points. Reported EBIT margin was up 180 basis points and on a comparable basis was up 140 basis points. Again, that is excluding the prior year purchase accounting charge and the extra month of V&C dilution this year. Turning to slide 5, from a geographic perspective, the momentum we've seen this past year continued in Q3 with broad-based demand and favorable trends across the world areas. Mature markets were up high-single digits led by North America. Europe returned to growth in Q3 after a flat first half, reflecting steady growth in air conditioning and refrigeration markets and improving trends in key process automation markets. Emerging markets were up high-single digits in the quarter led by Asia. Latin America grew 7% after being down slightly in the first half, reflecting favorable trends across both business platforms. Turning now to slide 6, total segment margin was up 40 basis points, including the aforementioned timing impact of the Valves & Controls acquisition. On a comparable basis, excluding the additional month of V&C dilution in the current year, total segment margin was up 100 basis points. Operating cash flow was up 19% to $924 million driven by high quality earnings and strong working capital performance. Trade working capital improved 150 basis points driven by receivables and inventory improvement. Turning to slide 7, Automation Solutions underlying sales were up 12% in the quarter. Strong growth continues to be driven by MRO, small and mid-sized projects and turnaround activity across our key end markets. North America continued the trends we saw in the first half with both the U.S. and Canada up in the mid-teens. China likewise continued strong growth with broad-based investment and project wins across our key end markets. Outside of China, modest growth continued across the rest of Asia supported by solid MRO demand and improving investment activity, especially in India. Europe turned positive this quarter after being flat through the first half reflecting oil and gas investment in Eastern Europe and improving industrial investment across Eastern and Western Europe. Latin America was positive this quarter after being down slightly in the first half, and the region continues to show some signs of stabilizing and improving. Middle East and Africa growth was supported by strong MRO and improving investment across the region. Automation Solutions segment margin was up 170 basis points including the timing impact of the V&C acquisition. On a comparable basis, excluding the additional month of V&C dilution in the current year, segment margin was up 250 basis points. This improvement was driven by leverage, the benefit of prior period restructuring actions and operational improvements at Valves & Controls. Now please turn to slide 8 and I will hand the call over to Mr. Mike Train. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: Thanks, Tim. Pleasure to join the call again. Steven had asked me to provide a little bit of an update on our large project funnel, we shared that with you at the February investor meeting and we've updated it for today's discussion. On slide 8, you'll see for August 2018 we're at about $6.8 billion in funnel size. That has increased significantly since the February timeframe. We've seen projects going into the funnel really across all the different industry types that are listed there. I would say at this stage of the game, we're probably not anticipating the funnel to grow anymore given that there're smaller projects that don't make the funnel and there's investment decision dates beyond 2020. Right now, I think this is a very good set of projects that we're working with. There have been awards against this funnel probably on the order of $700 million to $800 million that we've been tracking over these last six months. Emerson has won a good number of those. I'm very satisfied with our hit rate on those awards. And generally, those have to be engineered by EPCs before they become orders and then ultimately become sales rec. So there's still a little bit of that out in front of us for the large part. We are seeing great take-up at our main valve partner concept. We've launched that here in the last year. Talking to customers as we've built up larger Final Control business. We are already seeing some very serious discussions around that and I think there's going to be end users and engineering contractors that want to take advantage of that. All in all, I think again the project pace is strong. I think the activities are there. I've been around the world twice in the last four months, talking with EPCs and customers. We see customers stationed at the EPCs. They're doing the pre-work, the pre-feed, the feed work. And it looks pretty robust I think as we look forward. So that is slide 8. Slide 9, I just wanted to kind of pull in some other indicators from around the industry, if you will. Left-hand side talks to the CapEx across the oil and gas value chain. So it's the upstream, the midstream and the downstream. And really based on what we're seeing in the global data, we are seeing that CapEx numbers are starting to lean forward, grow positively. I think there's outlook and expectations for that. I think those will firm up as people start talking about their 2019 year here in the next quarter or two. And then down the right-hand side of the chart, just some of the different perspectives, BP is trying to add to their net oil capability, raising the production; TechnipFMC is one of the many engineering contractors that were recently announced their expectations. They're seeing their backlogs move higher. We've seen that with a number of others as well. And then laid out a little bit of what's going on in Mexico here. We've had some change in the government regime there. They're already starting to lean forward into some of the investment activities they want to put forward here, which I think are going to be pretty robust for Emerson as we move forward here. So I think the insight from customers, what we're seeing across the market, I think it all suggests that we've got a pretty strong automation marketplace, certainly over the next two to three years. Tim, that's it from me. Timothy Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.: Thanks, Mike. So we'll continue now on slide 10, in the Commercial & Residential Solutions, underlying sales were up 2% in the quarter. In North America, air conditioning demand accelerated versus the second quarter, underlying demand and macroeconomic trends remain strong and we expect air conditioning growth to further accelerate into Q4. Growth in China was impacted by timing of government subsidies for heat pump units. Outside of China, demand remained strong across the rest of Asia in air conditioning and refrigeration markets. Solid growth continues in Europe reflecting steady demand for professional tools and strong growth in air conditioning, heating and refrigeration markets. Margin decreased 80 basis points as material inflation and unfavorable mix was partially offset by operational leverage, higher price realization and the benefit of prior-period restructuring actions and aided by the divestiture of the ClosetMaid business which was sold in October of 2017. And now if you turn, please, to slide 11 and I will hand the call over to Bob Sharp. Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.: Thanks, Tim. First of all, I'll give everybody an update. We closed on Textron Tools & Tests right at the beginning of the quarter. So as Q4 is reported, you'll see it's starting to come into the numbers. And I'll say we're off to a very good start here, a very good combination. We have merged RIDGID Tool and Tools & Test together into a single professional tools organization with a singular management team. That's well underway. A lot of activities now around our global footprint, especially from a sales coverage and customer standpoint at the beginning. A lot of work right now with optimizing our North America sales presence and, again, good progress on that. We'll be having some actions here soon. Focusing heavily right now on the spend, you saw a lot of opportunities we presented as far as margin potential. Materials is a big piece of that. We've already done a heavy analysis of the material buy of the Tools & Test business combined with RIDGID and have a number of activities underway, certainly, applying Emerson's terms around payables and other things with some very good quick progress there. So overall, good organization. We've had several meetings with these management team and employees throughout the sites and we've been in all the factories, doing a lot of work in the factories around safety and operational activities. And I'll say there's a very good vibe right now as far as people feeling the combination, both from the RIDGID folks, as well as the Textron Tools folks recognizing that this is a very obvious cultural combination, if you will. And everybody's seeing some good opportunities and really good reaction from the customers as well. So we've talked about synergies. You see synergies around $40 million, a lot of that cost driven, also a number coming from sales in the time. And then cash flow, these two businesses combined generate very good, healthy cash flow and we see a tremendous opportunity to increase that combination over the next four or five years as we have the plan that plays out. Good start there. Chart 12, I think it is, on Asia. Certainly, China was a change. We have enjoyed a very nice string of extreme growth, I'll say, in China and certainly had some amount of a pause here in Q3. Very much timed to heating. As they start getting in focus the heating season and releasing government contracts and subsidy activities and things, clearly some pause in that activity. I will say, July was a good month. August is looking well and, as we show here, we're expecting to be back on a double-digit track in Q4. For this year, cold chain, commercial AC, heating, all 20% plus kind of growth dynamics. Residential AC up in the 10% territory. So certainly, we would have liked to seen a stronger number in Q3, but do not see that as any sign of any fundamental change right now. The market is going well. And as we've talked about recently, the industrial heating side of things is really actually kicked in quite a bit and we certainly see quite a bit of visibility on that one \u2013 as that one, frankly, is just getting started after the residential play. So overall, you could see the map here shows there's a number of areas in the coldest environments, the low ambi environment up north. The scroll technology we have is a very good fit for that. When you get into the south and more in the sanitary and residential where the performance factors aren't quite as critical, a good presence in total. We also continue to have some very excellent solutions activity, a major convenience store chain in China, we've been working with on a monitoring solution that pulls in information from their refrigeration as well as the HVAC, lighting and other parts of their locations. There is a number of other franchises and customers that's relevant to. And then certainly with the coal chain activity going in China, supermarkets and all the other infrastructure build-out remained strong. Here is highlighting some integrated scroll rack solutions and Cooper-Atkins is also playing into both of these kind of opportunities as well as we have the chance to internationalize that business. So, again, we would have liked to seen a stronger Q3 in China, but fundamentally feel good about how things are playing out and how Q4 will get us back here. Timothy Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.: All right. Thanks Bob. So, turn to slide 13, which steps through our changes to our EPS guidance. The table starts with our May 1st GAAP EPS guidance of $3.10 to $3.20. As shown here, we are raising the guidance range $0.05 for stronger performance and $0.24 for our one-time tax benefit in Q3 associated with clarifications on U.S. tax reform implementation. The $150 million tax benefit in Q3 drove a 6% GAAP tax rate and reduced our full year expected tax rate from 25% to 27% to approximately 19%. Also included in the guidance update is $0.06 in Q4 for purchase accounting and restructuring charges associated with the Tools & Test and Aventics acquisitions. For these acquisitions, we expect to have little, if any, additional purchase accounting charges carry over into fiscal 2019. And finally, as discussed on our call \u2013 on our Q1 call, in response to U.S. tax reform legislation, the company reviewed U.S. comp and benefits programs and has enacted numerous improvements. As part of this, in the fourth quarter, we will take a charge of $24 million, or $0.03 per share, for discretionary one-time 401(k) contribution to every member of our U.S. workforce. The net impact of these changes is to raise our GAAP guidance range $0.20 to $3.30 to $3.40. Please turn now to slide 14, which outlines our updated full year guidance, and please note that this framework now includes the sales and earnings impact of the recently closed Tools & Test and Aventics acquisitions. We expect total Emerson underlying sales to grow 7.5% with Automation Solutions up 9% and Commercial & Residential Solutions up 4.5%. The GAAP EPS range of $3.30 to $3.40 represents growth of 30% to 34% compared with the prior year. This guidance assumes a neutral price/cost impact, as we continue to offset material inflation with price realization and cost reduction efforts. The expected effective tax rate for 2018 is reduced to 19% due to the one-time benefit in Q3, and we expect the tax rate in 2019 and thereafter to be 25%. The fourth quarter will be our fifth consecutive quarter of strong sales and earnings per share growth, as Q4 of last year was the first time since our strategic repositioning that we delivered both strong sales growth and earnings per share growth. In this fourth quarter, we expect 7% to 8% underlying growth and earnings per share of $0.86, plus or minus $0.05, including the $0.09 of acquisition charges and one-time 401(k) contribution shown on the bridge. For 2018, we expect free cash flow conversion of 110%, reflecting our high quality earnings. This guidance is in line with our prior guidance of 115% excluding the one-time tax benefit in the third quarter. And now, please turn to slide 15, and I will hand the call over to Mr. David Farr. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much, Tim. I also want to thank Bob and Mike for joining us today and updating everybody. They'll obviously be on the call to answer questions for the people that want to ask questions. As you look at the order trend chart, the trends have continued to stay within the band that we outlined in February of 2018 at the conference in New York. In total, I expect this will continue in the fourth quarter. I would expect us to be at the high end of this band as we've moved up towards that greater than 5%. Automation Solutions orders will continue to do well. From the standpoint of both Mike's business and Bob's business, Mike is now starting to come into tougher and tougher comps, because last year at this time, he had a very strong July and it will start to continue to bounce up against that. Bob's business clearly has been positive in the 5% to 10% range, and now it's a little slower over the last couple \u2013 two years. And so, his comparisons are getting tougher and tougher. But overall, I feel very good about the momentum, the pace of business is not slowing down, our growth and opportunities are out there, and we're seeing our customers continue to spend. We are seeing the impact \u2013 the positive impact of the new tax law in the United States, and people are spending money and we are clearly getting that piece of business. If you look at our North America sales and orders, they've been very strong since the enactment of the tax law. But I want to thank everybody for joining us today. One thing you might have noted from the first page, we had a recent STEM program and I was addressing my new employees, and I had one in the front row here in the little green outfit, you'll go back and look at that photograph, and she was asking me a great question. Her parents are shareholders and she was asking me a very delicate question. She said Mr. Farr, are you going to break the dividend string in 2019, and I said, I see no reason to break the dividend string in 2019, so \u2013 and she said, good, I'll be able to afford to buy more milk or whatever I need for eating here. So, she was very diligently asking me questions about the dividends, which is quite interesting. Timothy Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.: Good shareholder. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. She's a very good shareholder. I like those type of shareholders. As you know, one of the things that we've been doing and working across the company since the new platform structure is to make sure we have the right benefit structure, the right compensation structure across the global world. Clearly, we're trying to make sure that we're making the right enhancements to stay competitive. And as we said in the press release, we have continued to make changes to our package and \u2013 both on the health and medical side, also parental leave improvements, better vacation plans, and now the most recent one is the improvement in our 401(k), and we're making a one-time contribution to our U.S. employees which is going to cost us around $24 million. But it's all about making sure we have the best group of employees that we need around the world as we continue to enhance our benefits around the world. And in today's competitive environment, this is very, very important and we wanted to make sure that we did it. We'll continue to tune things a little bit, but the major actions have been undertaken and we'll continue to make sure that we stay competitive on a global basis, so that's extremely important to us. If you look at everything that's going on, it's been a very good six months. If I look at the improvement of sales, I look at the improvement of orders, I look at our gross margins, our EBIT margins, our cash flow, both businesses are operating at very high levels of performance. We had two days of planning conference with the new Final Control business. The total integration of V&C was outstanding. They are ahead relative to sales expectations. Our orders this year in both businesses are growing. We did not expect the orders of V&C would recover so fast, but they're growing in line with the Final Control and the whole Process business, which is exciting to see. We're seeing improvement in profitability. We're ahead of our margins that we expected and we're seeing a very strong cash flow as you can see in our cash flow conversion from the total company. But a really great job by both Mike's and Bob's organizations and around the world, and I want to thank his teams globally for doing an outstanding job. Mike and Bob, really appreciate that. If I look at the global market today, we have all of our global businesses now basically in the markets growing. We have the various marketplaces showing positive growth both in orders and sales. When we first started the year, we still had a couple markets that had not recovered, started growing. But now, in total, you're seeing all our markets growing. And as I look at the order pace and I look at the interest in business right now, that's a good thing to have as you move into 2019. You'll remember, we talked about that initially the mature markets would take over and grow first, which we've seen. We are now starting to see the emerging markets take off, and I would expect to see our emerging markets sometime in early-2019 outgrow our mature markets. Our mature markets will continue to grow at a good pace, but I expect the emerging markets to take off as the investments continue to go forward. As you look at the performance, last year at this time, our underlying sales were growing around 4%. We grew underlying sales 8%. As we go into the fourth quarter, last year, our underlying sales were growing 3%. We're talking about underlying sales growing around the 7.5% range at this point in time. Comparisons are getting tougher, but the pace of business remains to be very strong and we have very good momentum across this company in many areas. So, I'm very, very pleased about that. But I know that Bob now has his hands wrapped around and his team have their hands wrapped around the acquisition of the Textron Tools & Test business. They're quickly going about how they can integrate, they're quickly going about how they can grow this business, how they can improve the profitability. You'll clearly see, like we saw in V&C, the profitability in the segment will be hurt by this acquisition, because it's clearly a lower profit margin than we have today. But they have plans to get that margin back up and stop it from being dilutive in a relatively short time period. I also see improvements relative to cash flow, which is very important to us relative to that acquisition. But equally important, their organizations are working together very quickly and it's really exciting to see. We closed Aventics a couple weeks ago, and Mike and his team reported to the board today, as did Bob in his acquisition, and talked about what they see and what they see after the first couple weeks, in Bob's case, after the first 30 days. A lot of opportunities here and they're continuing to work it, and both of them will have a negative impact on initial margin, but will work its way through to make sure that it contributes to overall profitability as we move into 2019. But from the standpoint of where we stand with V&C and these two other major acquisitions, we've done a lot of acquisitions in the last 18 months and I would expect us to have bolt-on opportunities going into 2019, but I would \u2013 not the same magnitude of what we've done here in the last 18 months, but very strong performance, earnings and cash flow. And I fully believe that, as I said early on in the year, V&C will contribute to our overall earnings for the year and they will contribute very strongly in cash flow and their margins are getting to where they need to be as we've talked about, in fact they're ahead of plan as we move forward here, so really running well going into that fourth quarter. I would like to make one other comment relative to the corporate organization and in particular around Frank's team and Alex Peng and his team relative to the tax. The tax planning with the new tax laws, we were really well prepared and we were able to take advantage of our tax laws and really minimize the impact of the overall cost to the corporation. The true-up of picking up this much money, $150 million, both earnings and cash over time, but really reducing our rate for the quarter, again, investing in people, investing back in the company. But really this is a great job by Frank and Alex and the whole team down there, on behalf of all shareholders, to make sure that we have the right rate structure and make sure that we're doing the right thing on a global basis for tax payments, and really helped us for the quarter and also for \u2013 as we move forward into the coming years. Our effective tax rate will be in this 25% range. That's down 5 or 6 points from where it used to be. And so, that's a lot of value creation, and the question for us is how we put that money to use to grow the company a little bit faster, more profitable, and using that cash flow to also pay back more money to the shareholders over time, too. So, I'm very pleased, and Frank \u2013 and you know the team has done a great job down there. I appreciate that. As I look at that fourth quarter and I look at where we're heading into the fourth quarter, as we sat here three months ago talking about the third quarter, we talked about a quarter that would be plus or minus, I believe, around $0.85 \u2013 I said $0.85, plus or minus $0.02. I mean, that's basically how I think. I'm thinking within a $0.05. It's difficult for us to call it a $0.05. And I know people always thinks when we say plus or minus, it's always going to be plus. You should never think that. When I say that, I'm trying to give you the best range that I can give you at that point in time. As we look at the fourth quarter, we feel the momentum right now gives us about 7.5% underlying growth. We see pretty good growth relative to acquisitions. The currency will hurt us as we end the fourth quarter, but I still believe that we'll be over 10% on a GAAP basis. And clearly, the comps are getting tougher and tougher, but we have strong momentum going into this quarter. I expect this quarter to be, as we're saying here, around $0.86, plus or minus $0.02 to $0.03. Clearly, we'll push for the quarter ending and see what we can do, but that's about the range we see right now in the pace of business as we look at everything that we're dealing with across this company. And again, operations are doing well and we're performing well, and it was a very good quarter and we hope to continue to drive this in the next couple quarters. And I don't see any reason why not, at this point in time, but as every day is a new day in this world and we'll see what happens. But the momentum is on our behind, really with us right now and also from the standpoint of strong opportunities around the world for orders and for growth and for profit improvement. So, I like what we see at this point in time. And so, we have a lot more positive working for us than we do against us. So, with that opening the phone for calls, and we'll take some Q&A and look forward to talking to you. Operator : Absolutely. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Today's first question comes from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Nicole. Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, I guess last quarter, on the second quarter call, you commented that you expected Automation Solutions organic growth could accelerate in 2019, and we now have another quarter under our belt, things are stronger than expected, order growth was really healthy. So, I guess, would you sit here and make that same comment today, Dave? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. The issue was I've always said from the early on in the beginning of the year, Nicole, what I saw \u2013 I looked at this as a two-year type of band of growth. We always felt that the growth was going to accelerate throughout the year. We thought this year would be more of a not double-digit, we didn't think we'd cross that 10% mark. Clearly, now as I look at the two years, I've always felt that we would have somewhere around 16% to 18% to 19% combined growth. We have a lot of momentum right now. And so, we have a stronger front-end load. And so, from my perspective right now, I'm looking probably equal years from the standpoint. I don't see \u2013 there are certain things that our customers can work on, and as Mike said, as we see the funnels come up towards this top number, it could go up maybe a little bit higher, but at some point in time, we only can work on so many projects. So, the momentum is pretty strong. We're going to have obviously a stronger year this year. We're getting closer to 10% for the whole year underlying growth rate for the Automation business. And therefore \u2013 so, I'm looking next year probably going to be in that 9% to 10% range now, because I'm looking at that \u2013 I look at the two-year cycle for this business and it's not any different than I said last year or earlier this year. I said if we have a 7%, 8%, then I expect us to be a 9%, 10% next year. So, now I'm looking more equal-equal, Nicole, for the year just based on the way our customer base. And Mike, do you want to add anything to that? Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: I'd say we've seen very strong KOB3, the aftermarket business... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: ...throughout the year. It's been probably stronger than we even anticipated in February, and it's been good for our business. It's a relatively fast turn business. I think that's helped contribute to the second half here in a major way. The KOB1 projects, the greenfield projects will come along. They have their pace as you've indicated. They've got to get engineered. And I think \u2013 again, I think there was a lot of pent-up demand on the KOB3 side and we've seen a lot of that come through here as these customers have felt better with their cash flows and where they're sitting. So, I can't tell you that it can't be a double-digit year next year, but I think something in that 7%, 8%, 9% range right now feels about right. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: We always have to play it out and see what happens. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. I mean, historically, we have seen a two-year cycle, if you look back our cycles, we're typically when we're taking off on combined basis is at 16%, 17%, 18%, 19% on a 24-month time period. So, that's how I look at it. I thought we were going to be less front-end loaded. Now, it looks like we're stronger. But it's going to be a good year anyway you look at it, Nicole. Right now, our backlog \u2013 our growth in orders are strong. So, we're very positive about it. Now, we got to make sure we've enough people. That's a big issue now. Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thanks, Dave. And I guess for my follow-up, I know you've talked about in the past that one of your top concerns from a macro perspective is trade war. So, I have to ask, have you quantified the risk to Emerson from the tariffs that have been enacted to date? And I guess, just level of flexibility on your supply chain, your manufacturing footprint to handle what we're seeing today? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We have quantified it. We've not gone publicly. It's not that huge of a number relative to what we're doing. The teams have done a great job of offsetting both with material containment or pricing actions. We're staying slightly green. I think that will be the case for the fourth quarter and again next year. Obviously, Bob's business is more challenging. He has less flexibility in the short-term, but over the long-term, he can adjust. We have the flexibility around the world. We talked about this with the board, where today one of our global strategy is to have that flex manufacturing capability and we've had that flex manufacturing capability. Fortunately our businesses are not in, let's say, the bull's-eye of a lot of the tariff activity. So, it's smaller and we can react to it. So, just as much as \u2013 maybe some of our competitors are hurt, we're hurt, and vice versa, it's been a pretty good trade-off. But I don't like the way it's unfolding and hopefully things will settle. But right now, it's manageable as we told the board. And next year, what will happen is we'll have to have more material containment, we'll have to have a little bit more pricing, and clearly, it's creating an inflationary environment which helps us both at the top line, faster growth, but also forces us to do a lot more material containment around it. So, it's very manageable at this point in time even with the current actions underway and I have much bigger issues in the world than that. Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Understood. Thanks, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. Maybe a first question just on the incremental margins in Automation, I think you've been pretty clear on the top line drivers. Your incremental margins in the third quarter, I think were close to 30% or so. So, just wondered when you're looking at the good progress on Valves & Controls and the changing mix of sort of revenues in AS over the next 12 months, do you think that 30% level is a good incremental margin to aim at? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: If you look at the true underlying performance, we are around 35% for the quarter. And as we talked about \u2013 this is Julian, correct? Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Julian, as we talked about is what Mike is having to do right now with the faster order pace running at 12% \u2013 10%, 12%, Mike is starting to have to \u2013 and we talked about this, he'll have to start adding some incremental people around the world to deal with the projects. So, I feel very comfortable in this 30%, 35% range at this growth level. If growth level slows down, then we'll expect that to go up a little bit higher. But right now, we're having to put people in place, we're having to make investments both from the capacity and from a capital standpoint and to take care of some of this growth. Many of Mike's businesses right now in North America are actually getting back to peak performance in last cycle in its actual sales. So, what that means is we're having to get our plants geared up, we're having to get the people geared up, and that's something that we got to make sure we stay ahead of given our presence around the world and given how fast we're leading out of this relative to our competitors. I feel very good about the margin at this point in time, but Mike and I also have to keep having the debate back and forth what's the right balance of adding new people, adding new capacity, and it's a debate that we have a lot, but I think our margin right now \u2013 this quarter is around 35%. I think we're going to stay in this 35% range. And if we have to drift it down a little bit for Mike, then we'll do that, but also if he slows, we're going to take it back up. So, that's how we see it right now. Mike, do you have anything you want to add from Julian's standpoint? Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: No. I think that's right. Again, we've had a very nice mix of business so far. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: (00:36:44) North America... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Correct. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: ...all have been... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Very good. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: ...all have been very positive, very good for us. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We don't see \u2013 going back to both what Nicole asked and what you're talking about here, our project load right now, if you look at it, it's still very KOB1, KOB2 centric. The big projects have just started coming. And as you know me, Julian, I like to take guesses. So, as I look at the project funnel right now, what Mike is talking about and his business are talking about, it looks to me like it's really 2020, 2021 that the KOB1 mix are really going to put pressure on us, and then \u2013 but we have to get ready for that up to that, because it looks like that's where those bigger projects are heading. I mean, if you look at classic example, if you look at what happened to ExxonMobil last quarter, I mean I've always felt that our industry is underspent and was not ready for the downturn. And you saw that from the standpoint that now people are having to spend \u2013 quickly have to spend on maintaining their facilities and the production is having to come up much faster. And if they had not maintained their facilities or are not ready for this, they obviously suffer. And this is happening across the world in this case, and it's something we saw because they cut so deeply from a capital standpoint. So, that's where we are. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. And then, just maybe for my follow-up switching to Bob's business, the North America growth has been pretty soft in the last few quarters, I guess, in Commercial & Resi. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I mean, it looks like the \u2013 in Residential HVAC, at least the OEMs have seen high-single-digit growth on average in the last couple of quarters. So, just wondered is there just some timing that's weighing on the Commercial & Resi North America numbers, some market share moving around or just kind of what's going on there and when do you see that North America piece reaccelerating? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Before I turn it over (00:38:39), keep in mind too also, our OEMs have been getting price now for 18 months. They've been going out with some very large price increases. And so, some of those numbers \u2013 they had good underlying volume, but some of those numbers also are price inflated. So, Bob, you can answer the question now. Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.: Right. I think you're going to see that pretty heavily. I mean, I think everybody knows that we've got material clauses that we do with our \u2013 especially the large U.S. OEMs on pricing. And when the \u2013 in the deflationary time, we enjoy that a lot. If you remember back in 2016, we had over 2 points of EBIT margin improvement for Climate, and obviously now that's in a different zone, but again that's kind of normal. That is certainly widening the sales reported numbers as well. I think we've got a pretty strong presence in the industry. We think we know very well what's going on. We don't see participation issues. Frankly, there are some advantages. You've probably seen in the industry a compressor manufacturer very recently announcing that they're going to be moving away from the industry. And frankly, there's a lot of activity right now, we're involved with, with helping out some customers respond to that quickly. So, that's good news for us. Three to one (00:39:53), there are some compressors coming this way. We don't ship compressors from here to China, but there are compressors that come in this way from some of the competition... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: From China to here. Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.: ...from China to here. That has also created some conversations, let's say, with OEMs. So, again, there's a gap right now, no question. We model it a 100 different ways, and frankly, I can't say we ever found the perfect way to correlate between what we report and what they do. There's distribution, there's timing, there's prebuilds, there's a lot of things that play out. But overall, again, we think we understand our position in this space and it's playing out pretty normally, I guess. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean, Julian, it's \u2013 we watch it very closely, because we know everyone reports around this space here and we play with all the players. I mean, I would expect Bob's business here to probably be up pretty good for the next five to six months a good order pace as these guys do a lot of moving around and shuffling and replace the backlog of the pipeline. So, overall, we feel very good about it and we'll see how it unfolds, but it's definitely a different mix this year than we've seen in the past. Service levels, service type of \u2013 several products have been different this year and how service has been doing, and it's a good year overall. So, I mean... Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.: That's good. And Q4 has been a warm quarter and we feel good about the way this quarter is playing out as well. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Great. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hello, David. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good afternoon, Steve. How are you doing? Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Looks like a... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I had to bring a couple friends to take you on today. So, I've got three guys here. I've got my baseball bat. I've got my Rally Monkey. The Rally Monkey is really keeping a very close eye on Tim, because... Timothy Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.: It's really staring me down. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's staring Tim down right now, and so... Timothy Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.: It's making me nervous. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. He's right behind Tim's head looking at him. What can I do for you, Mr. Tusa? Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : It must have been nice to have that kind of engaged and thoughtful crowd in that auditorium versus some of the Investor Days. This looks like an engaged crowd there, so. Timothy Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.: (00:42:04) Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : A new audience for you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Steve she not only had iPhones taking pictures of my charts. You'll notice I had the one chart rolled up, because I was afraid to show her, because she wanted to take it home, it was our dividend history. Timothy Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.: Leave it there for a fortnight. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Nice to refresh the audience every once in a while, that's key, got to keep them fresh. How many years has it been now \u2013 I mean, jeez? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No funky sweaters on, either. Nobody had those little funky sweater shirts on, either. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Anyway. Anyway. On this Climate thing, what will your volumes grow in kind of North America Resi for the year now, kind of on a seasonal adjusted basis? I mean, I guess your fiscal year is kind of aligned with the OEM's calendar year. I'm just curious what that number will be ultimately? What do you think it will be when all is said and done? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: What will the volume numbers be for this year? Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Like, mid-singles? I mean, it just seems like \u2013 I just want to get a number on the board. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. We'll be in the mid-singles. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: And to be honest, the compressor shipments this year are hitting an all-time high for us. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think we are hitting an all-time high. And so, the plants are running pretty strong right now and a lot of our customers are starting to level load more production, Steve, versus where they used to try to cycle. We're starting to see more and more customers to try to keep things level, which smooths us out more. So, we're not seasonal. It's a different view than we \u2013 we're starting to see some different habits from our customers now. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: In the last few years, we've had quarters where it's been down in a quarter, and we've had quarters that have been high-single and double-digit. So, even quarter to quarter, there can be several point swing. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And I guess, I'm just kind of struggling a little bit with the fourth quarter, because you said about six ways from Sunday $0.86 and maybe plus, maybe minus. Normal seasonality to us looks more like $0.90 and I'm just trying to figure out, if Climate is bouncing back and the orders here at Automation quite frankly accelerated, did you pull something forward here into the third quarter? It doesn't seem like that. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No. No, we didn't. You also got to keep in mind that $0.86 we're taking care of the one-time accounting stuff for Aventics, we're taking care of the $0.03. And so, I mean... Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: ...those are two restructuring. So, you're right I mean normally. But we're also taking care of some issues as we close some deals and as we do the one-time 401(k). So, that I mean \u2013 as you well know, Steve, I really can't call a quarter within $0.05. And so, when I look at that and say that feels about right and it would be, as you say, the normal seasonal thing would be around that $0.90 plus. That's why if you \u2013 that's what we have to deal with relative to the... Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: ...that's what's going on. So, you're not that far off. It's just \u2013 don't forget about the $0.06 and the $.03 from what we're doing there. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. And then, I guess just as a follow-up to that, on Climate, you guys have these kind of escalators that I guess that would mean your pricing is going to kind of lag by maybe a quarter or two, a quarter plus relative to raw materials. It's not necessarily like, hey, we're an OEM and we're going to do a price increase at the beginning of the year, and then this kind of unusual price increase in the middle of the year. You guys are a bit more on a rolling basis. So, I mean, if raw is kind of stabilized here, can you be in Climate green at some point here in 2019 and start to kind of flip the other way for a period of time, given the way your escalators are working? Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. It depends on the timing of when it happens. Again, if it happens later in the year, it's difficult, because we're still carrying that drag. But, again, you saw it happen when it turned unfavorable on us about 18 or so months ago. Like you said, it takes a quarter or two to sink in. And as it subsides or even stabilizes, that's about the same kind of a lag timing to go the other way. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We'll start seeing the benefit \u2013 you'll see the benefit next coming now in early next year, 2019, so. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. So, that's a good guide. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: ...outside of the lags, we are green already. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Got it. Got it. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: And it's going to play out that way again through next year. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Steve we work a very fine line with our OEMs, because we know that we're trying to make sure they stay competitive, we stay competitive, but also we're trying to keep it really tight around that plus or minus line relative to price/cost type of situation. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. One last one for you, Valves & Controls, what kind of revenues will that business finish at in fiscal 2018 or? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I don't think the revenue is going to change much. I think they're going to be slightly \u2013 on a reported basis, they're going to be slightly down, because of the divestitures in the product lines we got rid of. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: But the underlying growth rate is now growing. So, now next year we're going to have a growth. And so, the underlying order growth is around 9%, 10%. So, they were slightly down because of what we divested and what we're getting out of, but now they're coming off. And if you look at the order pattern, they're growing faster. So, now they're going to start growing. So, overall, we're going to grow that business and it's going to be \u2013 we got a good couple years here between that business and what we're trying to do with it. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Looks like it. All right. Thanks a lot. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you very much, Steve. I appreciate it. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Take it easy. Yeah. Operator : And our next question today comes from Steve Winoker of UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Thanks and good afternoon. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: How you doing, Steve? Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, Dave. I can't resist also on that front page, I know you guys turn over every stone for new investors and applause, and on that one, it looks like you got both. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's definitely. And as Tusa said, this is a little bit more friendly audience, other than the fact that they never shut up. I mean... Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Well, that's not that different. Anyway. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: ...but that was an unbelievable time we had. I don't know how many kids we had, 400 kids in that room? I mean, Tim was around here. Tim the Toolman was around here somewhere, too. His kids were there. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. You should let the analysts bring their kids next time, too. Probably it'd be a better day. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. In New York \u2013 yeah, we're doing it in New York. You can bring your kids in. Now, have your kids heard anyone swear before? Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : All the time, because I let them play \u2013 I play your replays for them, so. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: (00:48:33) Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Anyway. So, listen, on page 8 for you and Mike, that large project funnel, I just want to go back to that, and the resilience of that sliver, there were large, large projects in the 2018 timeframe through 2019. How resilient are those in terms of the decision dates? All of this macro turmoil, you've already addressed it a little bit. Once these things get started, they're very hard to stop. And how deep into that do you think we are for the kind of KOB1 and KOB2? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: (00:49:10) Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: So, I'd say for the, we'll call it the megas, the big ones that we showed you a little depiction of that when we were together in February. If I drew that chart again, it would look similar, some megas and a lot of smaller projects, and kind of the positions timing-wise similar. The big space there is the L&G space. There are 10-plus projects there that are on the mega sizes. They are gearing up. Again, I've been around the world to meet the EPCs that specifically touch those projects. They are doing a lot of work right now getting ready. We're doing a lot of budgetary quotations to them, so they can plan their projects. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: You're talking about trying to tie up some capacity? Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: I told them they better start reserving capacity. You can just see this bow wave coming at us and they need to start thinking that way. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: They want all of our valves, they want all of the engineers to work on these projects, they need to get in line with us pretty early and they're doing that. They are doing that. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : And how does that relate to that $700 million to $800 million number that you gave in terms of awards versus your wins? And should we think about therefore that piece of it stepping up significantly? Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. The largest ones, they're still out there. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. The big... Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: A lot of the awards are been on the smaller size. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. He's been \u2013 most of the awards have been in the $1 million to $10 million range. You've got a couple bigger ones, but most of them are smaller. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. They're not in the $100 million plus, but we've had \u2013 and when we get an award, it could be for a piece of the business, we might get systems early, we might get the valves early. So, we're tracking all of the puts and takes around that. So, take $800 million out of the funnel, we saw about $2 billion go into the funnel to kind of make all the math work out. So, that's what I kind of think. I don't think we'll see the funnel getting larger, because I think anything that works at $78 a gallon oil is identified, it's out there and if it's going to have a decision date within 2.5 years, it's got to worked right. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Steve, what goes on at the CEO level on these projects, and I'll give you my perspective of what goes on here is the projects, they have them prioritized right now, but the prioritization will change. And what will happen is the CEOs, the executives will look and say, okay, the people, the location in the world, there might be issues popping up in regions of the world or they need more gas, they need more oil or we need more issues relative to our own manufacturing, they will move some of these projects, you can see a project move six months in, six months out. These projects will slip moving in and out, but what we see is we track them and we move them back, when you can see other ones come in front. So, right now what we have been seeing is the projects have been moving around a little bit. So, we're \u2013 it's like a motion. This doesn't look like a motion, but those things are moving. But the funnel is pretty tight and consistent, and where some of these projects are moving around is pretty good right now. But what we didn't have in February and we don't have it here now is that we had only a few of what we call the big megas sitting in 2019, early-2020. We now look at that chart and there's a lot more of the megas coming in late-2019, early-2020. So, that tells me when I made my earlier statement, I think our KOB1 business is really going to start getting up there in that level in the late-2020, 2021 type of period, because that's what's going to happen. That's where we're right now. The funnel is shaping up pretty nicely. We might get up to $7 billion total, but that's a lot of work going on out there at this point in time. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : And Dave, I don't think you put a finer point, but if you could on the July order experience in AS and maybe in C&RS, too? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Mike was real close around 10% and ARS (00:52:40) was probably very consistent with where we were before I think, in the 3% to 4% range. That's very preliminary numbers and we push him hard to get a number for this call here. But I still think we're in the good side of that band. And so, overall, we're in pretty good shape. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And just lastly, Mike \u2013 sorry, Bob, we talked a lot about cold chain in Asia, commercial opportunity when we last saw each other. This China heat pump subsidy push-out slightly doesn't change any of the math you've got on kind of a one-year view, two-year view? Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.: No, not at all. Like I said, cold chain this year, we're going to be in the high-teens, let's say, territory. We've done a lot of things to put that organization together for a full solutions play. The Cargo and Cooper-Atkins acquisitions, we are putting infrastructure in Asia and Europe to internationalize. So those are progressing well. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Steve, before you go, I'm going to ask Bob or Mike to comment. I mean, no one has really talked much \u2013 asked quite but Mike had a phenomenal quarter in China. And it's very broad-based, because we were just over there and we did a review. And we were up on sales 20-some-odd percent for the quarter? The quarter has been very strong. So we're seeing \u2013 Mike, do you comment, we're seeing very broad across all industries a lot of new players coming in and starting to build stuff both in China and moving outside. And that's been a very pleasant surprise for the last couple of quarters. You may want to comment? Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: China has been strong for us. I think locally we've seen a lot of, the state owned is busy, a lot going on with the privately-owned enterprises. We're seeing these chemical companies rise up over the last five, six, seven years. They're getting very serious. They don't want to buy the mid-tier product anymore. They want the high-quality stuff and they're leaving the borders. We've got one that we're working on that's going to go to Louisiana staying at the gas prices. But China for us is broad-based. And, again, I think I referenced it in February, there's a refining wave that's going to come at us in China, a smaller one in India to go along with it. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's a power wave. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: A lot of spend there. Power is still very solid for us. We saw the nuclear plants start-up here in the last few months. So we got some of those behind us now. So we can get on to the next ones that we've been ready to work on. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: But I would... Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: I'd say. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I was impressed. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: ...China is really a delight. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I was impressed, Steve. I was there with Mike and his team just recently. Bob was there, too. Bob tried to do, tried to run me over in a car, you were with me too, so. Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.: I didn't try because I was next to you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, but I was impressed with the broad base of all the orders and the type of industries going on and the customer list. And one of the good things in this cycle here is a lot of the smaller players that we are competing against do not have financing. They don't have the money to get \u2013 access to money. And so the big multinational companies continue to make investments, which we continue to do, including upgrading our manufacturing capability in China with the V&C stuff. We are really, really actually separating ourself again in China. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Good guys. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thanks. Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.: And outside of China, we're talking a lot about China. Commercial, we were double-digit outside of China in Q3 and we were in Q2 also. So there's plenty of activity going on in Asia broadly. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, we had same. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Good job. Who is next? Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : And our next question today comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good day, everyone. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Hey, Jeff. You notice how our orders and sales stayed pretty consistent and how they sort of track together? Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yeah, that's amazing. I cover a bunch of companies that that doesn't happen. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Really. One of the differences we have, Sprague and a lot of people give me a hard time about releasing orders, all of these guys are going shit I can't believe you'd say that, but that's okay. The issue is one of the disciplines we have across this company is making sure the order pace and monitoring those and what we tell you guys are consistent, because if you don't get an order and eventually get sales, something is going on. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yeah. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: So I just had to tweak you a little bit my friend. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Well, I always give you credit for those orders but thanks for calling it out. I guess, even the kids in the audience probably now that if sales don't catch up with orders, then the orders aren't real, right? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I'll explain that. That was the next question I've got. She asked about the dividend. She didn't quite get the connection between. I mean, I tell the guys, orders are great but without a sale I can't pay a dividend. These guys hear me say that all the time. Go ahead. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : I thought you are trying to suggest we were children by the way you put that on the slide, but... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: That's not a bad thought. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yeah. So, hey, obviously, things look extremely robust and everything you said about projects sounds very encouraging. How do you put in context the fact, though, that you're looking at CapEx in your sort of markets actually now exceeding the 2014 peaks when oil prices are lower and there's other maybe countervailing forces? Would that reflect that maybe some of those projects just got truncated in 2014 and didn't happen? Or just what kind of big picture perspective would you add to that? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Wow. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: Well, I think as we came off the 2014 and the peak, there were projects that were planned and did not move and they got parked and they kind of idled and they've gotten resurrected. And a little bit of pre speed (00:58:10) work has been done on them and now people are making those decisions to move forward. So we're certainly seeing some like that that have been hanging out there for a couple of years, Jeff. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I'd say, Jeff, the biggest issue we see in North America is North America has very strong and there's capital. If you look at the GFI in the U.S., you'll see the numbers are quite strong. Is that \u2013 the pressure on our customer base was so enormous relative to cut capital so quickly that they stopped stuff very quickly in North America. They did not stop as quickly internationally in North America and that's why we've seen the North America bounce back. And so I'm sitting there in the Valves & Controls conference with Final Control and we're seeing North America numbers coming back to levels we saw in 2014 so quickly. And that tells me that things were cut off abruptly and they had to come right back on and they're ready to do it right and I think that's a very good observation because that's what we're seeing right now. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: One other insight there is the movement of energy to different parts of the world has gone up. The U.S. is exporting LNG, it was not doing that back in 2014. So we're seeing terminal and midstream spend build... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: They're all good thing for us. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: We're seeing it in Mexico, we're sitting it in the Middle East, we're seeing it in Asia. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : All right. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: So I think those are some of the things that are different. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : All right. Unknown Speaker : Resources becomes a throttle too on those projects, right? I mean, yeah, that's happened before in the peak time. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Exactly. The other thing I would say that with the way I talked about V&C, I think V&C, the Valves & Controls, they did not have the capability of manufacturing the products here in the United States. And one of the things Mike's team has gone on rapidly is now, we have huge opportunities here in North America that we get addressed very quickly with our channels. And the markets turned our way. So we're now getting V&C products into customers that they never been in before. And now we're having to quickly accelerate manufacturing and spend money and that's given us another little bump here in North America that we were not anticipating. My hat is off to Ram and his team and Mike for getting that done because that was not easy to do. We still have 18, 24 months of fairly good investments to make here. But things moved our way pretty quickly and the team executed very rapidly and the timing of the V&C acquisition has been on perfect, as I look at it. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: I'd say all across the platform, everybody stepped up. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We need them. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: And everybody is going fast. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We needed them. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Very clear. Just one thing. There's obviously been a disconnect in Automation this year kind of observed incremental versus underlying as you digested V&C. Should those numbers be very similar now in 2019? You've got a little Aventics noise, but should be kind of what we see is what we get on the incrementals? Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: V&C is on a good path to improve. They will continue to improve. They're not there yet. Aventics, sizable number going to come in lower. It's going to average us down. We will work that over time. Take a couple years. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I think that the big issue is what we're having to go through right now is we're having to spend some different capacity and some investment both in some of the service centers around the world. I mean, I think we'll probably still have a one more year of a slight dilution there from an impact. But the profitability is going to be still very good, but I don't think it will be quite accelerating as you're thinking there, Jeff. Because I still see some dilution impact, and I still see some incremental investment that we're making faster than we originally planned. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: We have a lot of potential. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Solid. Thank you. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon, Dave. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Go ahead. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. So just want to go back to the product funnel, the obviously very impressive buildup of projects. I just want to broaden out Jeff's question. What do you think this implies for the broader cycle? I mean, I'm talking here about some of your shorter cycle businesses. And the \u2013 sort of the question is that the view out there is that we are late cycle, but my read of this is that we're now probably in mid cycle, any views there Dave? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, I'll give you my two cents. First of all, this is my gut feeling as you well pointed, Nigel, I mean, I've been in business long time, almost since my 18th year. I've been around this stuff for a long time. So this is my best feel at this, okay? It's a different cycle. I think we're in early stage of the cycle. I don't think this \u2013 there's been such a significant underinvestment, there's a stronger growth globally, there's a shift in energy usage to the gas and alternative fuels, but oil still used quite strongly around the world as a commodity. So what we see right now is a fairly large investment up right now early on to fine tune the facilities and to deal with the short-term capacity and then a long-term. So I think we're earlier cycle on this process. And so that's why, I mean, I feel very good about this point in time and from the standpoint of where we see the projects going, it's going to be \u2013 as Bob said, it's going to be a people capacity issue for not only our customers but also all of us too at the same time. But right now I think we've got it under control. It's going to take a little bit more investment and use of technology, but I feel pretty good about where we are in that cycle. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: I'd just add, four quarters ago we were still negative. I mean, we just looked at it a year ago and so this year obviously to comp against that we've been able to put up these nice growth rates. But I think the momentum is there. We're going to grow next year along the lines we've talked about earlier, and again I think some of these projects are three, four, five-year length playouts with the sales and everything coming with them. And unless something really wild happens in the world, this stuff is going to happen. They have not been exploring. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No, they haven't been. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: They've not been developing. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: They're still reducing reserves. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: Some of these guys have actually gotten behind. They got to move. So I think it's going to be pretty robust here. So I would still call it early cycle. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Historically, Nigel, I mean, I've been talking about it two years, but if you go and look at three years, I mean, these bundles are three years and they're beginning to the peak and the next year down. You're typically talking on average around 26% to 28%, 29% three-year type of average numbers of growth. And so we're just starting into this cycle at this point in time. On an average, you could take the three years and average it out. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Right. So I want to come back to the two-year comments. You mentioned a two-year cycle. So what you're saying now is thee years. So if it's two years of 8%, 9% growth then third year would be in that sort of slightly lower rate, but still 6%, 7%? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, 6% to 8% type of stuff. It's historically what we've seen. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Okay. Great. And then the follow-up question, so with the dilution on Aventics and Textron hitting in 4Q, it sounds like you got nice tailwinds to M&A in 2019. Can you just maybe fill in some gaps on 2019? You gave us the tax rate, but how about corporate? I think this year was a double year on the benefit. So how does corporate look into next year and any other color on 2019 would be helpful as well. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: So the \u2013 I mean for corporate cost expense standpoint? Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Well, I mean, I think we're in pretty good shape for the year because a couple things happened. We no longer have an overlap relative to our long-term performance share plan because we've now got that totally engaged, so we don't have that delta. The pension right now is still looking good. I think our pension costs are coming down. From an acquisition standpoint, I mean, my plan \u2013 we have done on average what, a $1.5 billion to $2 billion over the last two years. I think we're going to be less than $1 billion next year at this point in time. So from a corporate standpoint, we're in pretty good shape. We should be positive. We're in pretty good shape there. I don't see anything extraordinary coming at us at this point in time. We're still trying to manage the capital. You guys think it's real easy to spend money, sometimes it takes time to spend money and we're managing at that, and trying to get production geared up from that standpoint. But overall, I think the cost containment is pretty good. We're just selectively making \u2013 having to make some investments to deal with a long-term project that Mike sees coming at them and we want to make sure we're ready. We don't want to lose them and we want to make sure we can serve our customers on a global basis. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Well, that's a good example of capital, right, because commercial construction ability to execute is limited by the industry. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Right. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. That's an issue. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah, the corporate overlap, is that about $50 million of benefit next year? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I don't know, I haven't looked at it that tightly we'll talk to you in a week or so. Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: You figure it out and tell us. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Nigel, we're not \u2013 we haven't looked at 2019 that tightly yet... Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Got it. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Was it Andrew? Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: Nigel, Nigel. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Nigel, we haven't looked at that closely yet. Gee, we're trying to get the fourth quarter done. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Right. Okay. Thanks. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It will be a positive. I don't know, it will be a positive. I couldn't tell it that... Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.: ...we can't size it like that. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: God, I wish I was that good. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Thank you. You guys think we're that accurate. Operator : And our next question today comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Hello, Andrew. Andrew Burris Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch : Hey. How are you guys? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Not too bad. We're still trying to calculate the corporate cost. I mean, Frank barely got the tax planning done in the third quarter now he can't give me a total year corporate cost for next year. What's wrong with you, Frank? Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Gosh, you know... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: I mean, what do you think Andrew? What should we do with his budget, I mean his bonus this year? Andrew Burris Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch : I think you should raise it. I assume... Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: I always liked you. Andrew Burris Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch : Exactly. I need as many allies as I can get. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: That's great color (01:07:38), Andrew. Andrew Burris Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch : Just a question on taxes. It's interesting that it took you guys until this quarter \u2013 until this quarter to figure out that you guys want to give the 401(k) contribution. There's still tax adjustments. When you talk to your customers, how far along do you think they are in figuring out their taxes and what kind of impact the new tax structure will have on their behavior? Because I would imagine you guys are more sophisticated than \u2013 among the more sophisticated guys. So it took you like nine months to figure this out. What do you think your customer base is in terms of figuring out, okay, what do I do with these taxes? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: There's a couple of things going on here. One, the Treasury when they passed the law back in December, hadn't really propagated the laws yet. I mean, so it took a long time for them to get all the rules and regulations out. So as you know this year everyone had provisionals. We took provisionals. And we took a provisional in our first quarter, correct, Frank? Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: And so everyone has done that. Now \u2013 because we're a 9/30 company, the laws have been propagated and we have a clear vision of what's going on. So I would expect most companies are calendar year companies. So I would expect them to really get in this sort of figured out in November of \u2013 November, December, this timeframe. We just happen to get the rules came out a couple weeks ago, a month \u2013 about 30 days ago, about 45 days ago, we were able to get this thing hammered down pretty quickly. And so we moved forward with all the ins and outs of this thing and got it cleaned. Most companies will take all the way to the end of the calendar year to clean this up because there's a lot of things going on around the rules and regulations on the tax laws and that's why I wanted to thank Frank and Alex and those guys because there's a lot of work here and you got to make sure once you make that call that you don't reverse it. And I don't want to reverse it, because we're paying taxes along those lines. So anything else you want to add there, Frank? Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: No. No, I mean, I think our large customers obviously had a good sense of it, but many of them are calendar year, so they'll probably as Dave said wait till the end of the year. Smaller customers it's hard for me to generalize. I mean I think they figured out the CapEx portion of it pretty quick... Andrew Burris Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: ...in terms of getting the accelerated deduction. So I think it's pretty well done. Some of this clarification just came out in the last week. So I mean this is still moving around on us. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: And relative to 401(k), we have been planning things and studying things and we looked at all the benefits and this is the last big thing we wanted to do and typically we look at things like this would be more in the fourth quarter for us when we do things for our employees, our fiscal fourth quarter. And so that's why we did it then. I mean could we have done it earlier? The answer is yes. But this was after we looked at everything we were trying to do and magnifying and look at everything and so we made the decision to do it. And so normally when we go out and communicate increases and everything, this is just one more way you could just thank the employees for what they have done for us. Andrew Burris Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch : All right. Sure. And in terms of follow-up on the funnel, my understanding is that a big debate in the industry is that large international oil companies are sort of committed publicly to returning money to shareholders and at least publicly they have not committed to CapEx in 2019 or 2020. So some of the funnel that you are seeing are you actually having discussions with people other than \u2013 it seems like Exxon is the only one who got shellacked over it. But are you having discussions with people who have not publicly committed to spending money that in fact they are thinking about it? Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Absolutely. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Absolutely. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: I would say every customer is in that funnel with something, they've all got their priorities, they all got their programs. They don't like taxes going up a lot next year, I don't know but it's built in, they're working on it. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. I think we talked about this early on, Andrew. The first phase of capital this year were short-term stuff for these guys. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: A lot of that.... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Quick payback, quick payback, quick payback. They may not be publicly talking to you guys but they know they've got to increase their reserves. They've got to increase the sales, of the top line. So the investment discussions are underway, and it's happening. And it's also from a competitive standpoint they're not going to tell people where they're going for their money because that's a competitive advantage. So I think that you may not be seeing it, but we see it because we have to work with not only the ExxonMobils or the BPs or the Shells of the world, but we're also working with the EPCs right now. So the EPCs are getting very busy. And so, all these different things are coming together. So going back to what Nigel said, I think this is fairly early on in the medium size to large size projects at this point in time. I like where we are at this point and I'm more worried about how I'm going to produce it now as I get into late 2019 or early 2020. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: And those LNG projects, these guys are partnering with each other, and then they are going to partner of EPCs... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: So there's some complexities around all of that. But once they kind of get lined up, I think as you said Dave, they've kind of got to go. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Total project in LNG right now as you see out there, what's the total magnitude of projects being discussed, the total number? Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Over $1 billion out there for us. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yeah, but on total projects, what's the total projects? Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Oh, my God. I mean, 5% to 10% of the... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: So $1 billion for us. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: We're at 5%. So it will be... David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: There's a lot going on out there, Andrew. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: Absolutely. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: We're talking. Okay. Next? Andrew Burris Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks a lot, fantastic. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: All the best to you my friend. Frank likes you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Gautam Khanna, of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's got to be our last questioner, Gautam. You're coming up, you're the caboose man. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: All right. Pressure is on. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: No pressure. Just want to make sure that the caboose is bringing it forward, make sure, no one runs into us. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: I hear you. I had \u2013 a lot of questions have been asked and answered. But on incremental margins, just to get it calibrated, the two acquisitions Aventics and Tools & Test bring with it how much of intangibles amortization next year and on an ongoing basis, recognizing Q4 has done a lot of the one times? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Give us one second. We'll give you the numbers here, my friend. Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.: The full year amortization for Tools & Test, we gave as $25 million, and then Aventics should be in the same ballpark. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: I think about $50 million on a run rate basis for the two of them. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Got it. And so net of that, we're still talking north of $30 million incrementals? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: That's where we want to drive. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: I like south. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: He likes south, but I'm like north. I'm talking for my shareholders. Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.: We have discussions once in a while. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Yes Gautam. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. Just want to be clear. And then getting back to your earlier comment, Dave, about next year not being as rich in M&A opportunity set, is that a function there's opportunities out there or is there some internal constraint given the amount of activity you're doing just to integrate what you got let alone grow? David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: It's not internal constraint. It's a function of what we're trying to get our hands on right now Gautam. And if you look at the acquisitions of V&C, if you look at the Textron acquisition, you look at the Aventics acquisitions, all three of those major acquisitions in the paradigm, we have been working on for years. So it's just a function of what we see we're working on right now and trying to enticing and encouraging. We may have something new come out of the blue, we don't know about at this point in time, but I'm just looking at what we see working on and what we think we can shake loose as the cooperation where the acquisitions are coming from and it goes through cycles like that, and so we're working very, very hard and as we get into the 2019 and early 2020, they will try shake loose a couple of more good one, nice little bolt-on acquisitions. It just takes time that's how I see it. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thank you very much, gentlemen. David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.: Okay. Thank you very much. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. And very much appreciate you joining the call, and again, Mike and Bob and Frank, your whole teams out there around the world, thank you very much for what you accomplished this quarter. And we got one more quarter to get done this year and then we can go home and have a drink. Thank you very much, everybody. Operator : And thank you, sir. Today's conference has now concluded, and we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Emerson\u2019s Investor Conference Call. During today\u2019s presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, November 6, 2018. Emerson\u2019s commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company\u2019s outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson\u2019s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Tim Reeves, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead. Tim Reeves : Okay. Thank you, Gary. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Welcome to Emerson\u2019s fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Please follow along in the slide presentation, which is available on our website. I will start on Slide 3 with the full year summary. 2018 was a year of strong growth, operating performance and cash flow execution. This slide compares our actual results to the initial 2018 guidance from a year ago and which we over-delivered on almost every metric. Emerson underlying sales grew 8%. Automation Solutions was up 10% underlying, with growth across all world areas. Commercial and Residential Solutions grew 4% in 2018, following 5% growth in 2017 and has delivered nine consecutive quarters of underlying growth. GAAP EPS included over $0.20 of net one-time items, including $0.30 benefit of tax reform adoption partially offset by acquisition accounting and other charges we highlighted throughout the year. EPS growth was strong and benefited from core operating leverage as well as the lower U.S. corporate tax rate due to tax reform. Operating cash flow of $2.9 billion is 17% of sales and free cash flow is $2.3 billion and reflects a 114% conversion, excluding non-cash discrete tax items recognized in net earnings. In 2018, we completed our 62nd year of consecutive dividend increases and returned more than $2.2 billion to investors, including $1 billion of share repurchases. We also deployed $2.2 billion for acquisitions across both business platforms. These acquisitions represent important components of our long-term strategy and our path to 2021 EPS of $4.50 laid out at our February investor conference. So turning now to Slide 4, our fourth quarter results were at the high-end of guidance discussed on our third quarter conference call. Underlying sales growth was 8% in the quarter and September trailing 3-month underlying orders were also up 8%. GAAP EPS was $0.97, including an $0.08 discrete tax benefit. Excluding this item, EPS of $0.89 was up 16%. Turning now to Slide 5, fourth quarter gross margin was up 150 basis points on strong operating leverage and the benefit of cost reduction actions. Reported EBIT margin was down 30 basis points, including dilution from acquisitions that closed in the fourth quarter and the impact of a $24 million discretionary one-time 401(k) contribution to every member of our U.S. workforce as discussed on our Q3 call. Turning to Slide 6, from a geographic perspective, the momentum we have seen over the past year continued in Q4 with broad-based demand and favorable trends across the world areas. Underlying sales were up 8% in both Q4 and full year. Mature markets were up 7% in Q4 and in the full year led by North America. And likewise, emerging markets were up 8% in Q4 and in the full year led by Asia. Turning now to Slide 7, total segment margin was down 10 basis points, including recent acquisitions. Total segment margin was up 70 basis points to 19.9%, excluding Q4 acquisitions of AVENTICS and Tools & Test. This improvement reflects 30% core incremental margins in the quarter. Q4 cash flow was very strong. Free cash flow of $721 million is 15% of sales and free cash flow conversion was over 125%, excluding the non-cash discrete tax benefit from net earnings. Trade working capital improved 50 basis points driven by receivables and inventory performance. Turning now to Slide 8, Automation Solutions underlying sales were up 9% in the quarter and up 10% for the full year. September trailing 3-month underlying orders were up 11%. Strong demand for MRO continued through the quarter. KOB2 upgrade and optimization projects also continue to drive growth across our key markets. Projects like the one Emerson announced yesterday, a $32 million contract to modernize a gas processing facility in North Africa. Strong demand continued in North America and China with broad-based investment and project wins across our key end markets. Outside of China, growth continued across the rest of Asia supported by solid MRO demand and improving investment activity, especially in India. Growth in Latin America accelerated in Q4 as the investment climate continued to improve in the region, especially in Brazil and Chile. Automation Solutions segment margin was up 80 basis points and was up 140 basis points, excluding the AVENTICS acquisition. This improvement was driven by leverage, the benefit of prior year restructuring actions and favorable mix. Turning to Slide 9, Commercial and Residential Solutions, underlying sales grew 5% in the quarter and were up 4% for the year. September trailing 3-month underlying orders were up 3%. North America growth was driven by very strong commercial and residential air conditioning demand as well as strong demand in cold chain and professional tools markets. China growth was driven by cold chain and air conditioning markets offset by slower heating demand. Solid growth continued in Europe reflecting favorable trends in cold chain and professional tools markets. Margin decreased 150 basis points as material inflation and other inflation was partially offset by price realization, operational leverage and the benefit of prior period restructuring actions. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 10, which outlines our 2019 guidance framework and Q1 expectations. With a strong macroeconomic environment and favorable trends in our short cycle end-markets as well as longer cycle capital investments, we believe our momentum in 2018 will continue in 2019. For the full year, we expect underlying sales growth of 4% to 7% with Automation Solutions up 5% to 8% and Commercial and Residential Solutions up 3% to 5%. The stronger dollar results in an FX translation headwind for the year. Assuming October 31 FX rates hold for the remainder of 2019, we anticipate a $330 million unfavorable impact to net sales. The solid underlying growth we expect to deliver incremental margins of approximately 30% across our business platforms, driving GAAP EPS of $3.55 to $3.70 or growth of 3% to 7%, including over $0.20 of net headwinds from discrete tax benefits and other one-time items recognized in 2018. Excluding these prior year one-time items, our EPS target reflects double-digit growth. Our exceptional 2018 results and outlook for 2019 keeps us firmly on the path to $4.50 EPS in 2021 as presented at our investor conference in February. We anticipate also another strong year in cash flow as we continue to drive operations execution and incremental cash flow from recent acquisitions. 2019 operating cash flow is expected to be $3.2 billion and free cash flow conversion north of 100%. For Q1, we anticipate 6% to 7% underlying sales and EPS of $0.65 plus or minus $0.02. FX is expected to be a 2 points headwind to net sales and $0.01 to $0.02 drag on EPS. Please turn to Slide 11 which bridges our 2019 GAAP EPS guidance. In 2018, we had discrete tax items that drove a 16.6% effective tax rate versus the 25% we expect in 2019 and going forward. This $0.34 headwind is somewhat offset by one-time charges in 2018 that created a tailwind in 2019, including $0.09 of acquisition accounting charges and $0.03 for the one-time 401(k) contribution charge in Q4 \u201818. Together these items, net to more than $0.20 headwind in 2019. Next year, we expect to drive over $0.40 of EPS from operations execution and acquisitions or more than 10% EPS growth. The strength of the dollar against most major currencies drives the foreign currency translation headwind next year. Assuming October 31 rates for the remainder of \u201819, we expect currency to result in a $0.06 drag on EPS. And now please turn to Slide 12 and I will hand the call over to Mr. David Farr. David Farr : Thank you very much. Welcome everybody. The first thing you got to know as many of the people have been following me for a long time, over a year ago, I lost Zorro, my wife and I loss Zorro. And exactly 14 months later we decided to add a new member to the team. So I am introducing Rocket, a tri-colored King Charles Spaniel who is now 11 weeks old and Rocket is an individual that can move a little faster than Zorro kid in the later years, little bit more versatile and he is bringing new life and energy. As you can see in the order chart, we had a good finish to orders and I will talk a little bit about orders and where I see the growth going forward in 2019. But again, Rocket is engaged. He is ready to go and take us to the stronger performance in 2019 and 2020 beyond. So, I want to welcome everybody to Rocket. Now, we will obviously use him, as I did Zorro for many years as comparisons in jumping and earnings growth and things like that. So, with that, first of all, I want to welcome everybody today. I want to thank the global organization of Emerson for their support and tremendous execution over the last 12 months. We had a very strong fourth quarter. We did exceed what we communicated to you in August. We said that we will be delivering good solid growth around 7% and underlying sales and we said that EPS would be at $0.86 plus or minus $0.02 and we came in at $0.89 plus unique tax restructuring that Frank and his tax team put in, which benefits us over the long-term. So a very strong fourth quarter, on top of the rest of the year, it was an exceptional year of growth in earnings, in sales, cash flow, returns, return on total capital, growth through 20% again this year and 2018 and the Emerson team did an outstanding job. We also returned over $2.2 billion of cash to our shareholders. And we have made continued excellent progress on the free cash flow, the cash dividends ratio, this year, we have got it down to 54% and the OCE is totally focused on getting that number under 50% in 2019, which is basically 18 months ahead of what Frank and I presented over the last couple of years since the repositioning effort in 2016. But more importantly, great 2018, moment of joy, we are moving on to 2019. And I really want to make sure the global team understands a great year in 2018, but we got to continue to drive the growth, the improvement in margins, the improvement in cash flow, we need to make sure that we continued successful integration of the acquisitions, investments we have made over the last 2.5 years relative to the Pentair valves and controls, relative to AVENTICS, relative to Paradigm, the Textron Tools & Test business, we need to make sure that they deliver accretion and earnings and they deliver incremental positive cash flow for the corporation and for us to invest and payback to our shareholders. But as we look at the orders and we finished the orders last year, you can see that we had a continued trend on a positive note, I think up and around the 6%, 7%, 8% range for several, several, several months. We see that trend continuing in the first part of this year. But clearly, the global economy is changing. And as you think about our underlying sales growth that Tim presented on Chart 6 and I look at what we are saying this year in the 4% to 7% guide, let me give you a feel for what we see happening around the world right now tied to that 4% to 7% guide. Last year, the United States grew basically a tad over to 9%. We believe the U.S. growth, underlying growth this year would be in the 6% to 8% growth. We see still good momentum and our customer base is spending money, the U.S. economy is still solid, it\u2019s still growing. Yes, people can say the marginal growth rate slipping, but it\u2019s still at pace where people are investing, including companies like Emerson. We look at Canada, which grew last year around 12%. We see Canada slowing down in this 5%, 6% to 8% range like the United States as they continue to invest in materials, in the oil and gas, in those mining areas as they are important to Canada. As we look at Latin America, we see momentum in Latin America. From the standpoint of overall last year was 4%, in the fourth quarter, they did 10%. As I look at next year, I think that we are going to be in this 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, maybe if we are lucky, I will be talking in the quarters that we have double-digit quarter growth in Latin America to one area that I believe that are now kicking in as I said last year they had to prove it to me and they are now starting to prove it to me. So, I would say that, that is one of the places I feel good about. Europe last year was around 2%. I don\u2019t see much change. I think Europe is going to grow in this 2% to 3%. The economy is settled down to a lower growth environment. We have unique opportunities there, but still I don\u2019t see a very strong robust Europe at this point in time. Asia last year, outside of China was at 10%. As I look at it now, I think we are aiming to 6%, 8%, 9% range where we have seen good investments in India, Southeast Asia, Australia is investing well right now and some of the raw materials and mining areas. So a pretty good environment for us right now in Asia. The China situation clearly as people are concerned about it, our order pace has continued to be very strong in China in the Automation Solutions. Overall, we have delivered 17% growth last year. I a looking at growth more in the 7%, 8%, 9%, maybe 10% if we see a little pickup in the second half of the year and Bob Sharp\u2019s business around commercial residential solutions, but at slower growth, but still a pretty good growth pace for us as we see it. I would say, it\u2019s going to be driven by Automation Solutions where last year this was driven by commercial residential. Middle East and Africa, which had a good year around 6%, I think we are going to see a very similar type of growth rate 4%, 5%, 6% in Middle East and Africa. So again, we are having all of the world area \u2013 global world areas contributing to our growth. Our emerging markets last year grew faster than the mature markets. I expect that to happen again this year. The other key issue as we see it right now, last year at this time the wins were basically to our back as I told the board today I see cross wins today. We have wins cutting in front of us and back of us on the side. Overall though, it\u2019s still pushing forward and I am optimistic for our business profile where we are right now that we will still see good underlying growth. That\u2019s why we put the 4% to 7% underlying growth sales out there. We will know more as we get into February as we did see what happens relative to some of the discussions going on in Asia. But overall, we feel very good about where we are going. We had some issues that we have to overcome. As Tim said, relative to the headwinds, it\u2019s a little bit around $0.20. But our incremental margins, our acquisitions and the benefits that we have from our share repurchase program clearly will help us on the negative side, clearly the stronger dollar does sort us at this point in time, but we are putting forth I think a very good earnings forecast, a very good sales forecast and I think we will continue to outperform the market as we did this year relative to our global spaces as we performed extremely well across Emerson and around the world. So again, I want to thank everybody across Emerson for an outstanding year, a year that\u2019s really exciting. We have a lot of work cutout for us. The forecast we put in place right here keeps us well on the line towards the 2021 plan that we laid out in February to the investors both from a sales standpoint and execution around acquisitions on a share repurchase program and then obviously incremental margin performance. So that\u2019s where we sit right now. We feel good about it. I feel good about how the team executed this year as did the board today as we reviewed the final results with them. And I look forward to delivering a strong performance for Emerson, for our shareholders again and in fiscal 2019. And so with that, I will open the mic for questions and look forward to an interesting debate with my investors and sell-side analysts. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Good day, Dave. How are you? David Farr : Not too bad, Rocket says hello to you Jeff. He is ready to nibble on you. Jeff Sprague : Alright, well. He is a cute little guy. He actually looks a lot like the pokey little pup that I learned to read with. And I guess if you put up 4% organic growth, pokey is going to be a little bit better name perhaps. What has to happen to get down to 4, Dave, those ranges you laid out there that don\u2019t really seem to even bring 4 into the conversation? David Farr : I think that the range \u2013 4 comes into play the following. We do have a lot of tension with China. And what we see would be the consequences of about that would slow down, what I would call not only China growth all across Asia-Pacific growth. So, I think that\u2019s why I am putting that stake down there, Jeff. You are right, if you add up the numbers, it will be more like a 5 at the low end. My core belief does not believe and say that, but in the same time, I want to make sure if investors understand, there are concerns that I would have would be in Asia, would be around China. I think Europe potentially could weaken. As you know, there is a lot of political uncertainty in Europe right now. Even though we don\u2019t have a robust growth, I am always concerned about when the political uncertainty comes in Europe. So, those are the markets I am really worried about. But my gut tells me we are still going to be in this solid single-digit range and we are not going to be as strong as this year at 7.7, it was a really strong year. But we are going to do better than the underlying GFI, which is probably going to be around 3.8%, 4%. So that\u2019s how I see it. Jeff Sprague : And Dave, on the question of projects right on the last call or maybe it was two calls ago, there was a sense that things were really kind of getting to the altar and people needed to pull the trigger. The resources weren\u2019t going to be there. I assume that still stands. But do you see people hitting the pause button a little bit on bigger projects because of all these uncertainties or do you think the bigger projects that are in your funnel actually do start to kind of come into play here? David Farr : Well, we believe they are going to come into play. We reviewed with the board today, Lal reviewed with the board today. About 6 or 7 significant projects, we are seeing more KOB2 right now like you did saw one today, which there is people that means kind of business tool which means upgrades and brownfields. The big projects are still being worked on ongoing in with Lal and Mike into Japan next week on a couple of large projects for the Middle East. So, right now, I don\u2019t see any delay happening. I still believe the larger projects will be rear end loaded in this year and then we won\u2019t really see much of that growth coming into probably 2020, but we will see a little bit in the fourth quarter based on the projects, but the project size are getting larger. Right now, we saw bigger ones as Frank saw today with Lal reviewing the board and we have seen \u2013 we see no delay right now. But clearly, as I said, there is a lot of cross winds going on. And so some of these winds shift and do a little sheer work on it, you could see a company like Emerson gets sheered. But right now, I still feel very good about it. We will give you an update on the overall projects in the funnel again in February, but as we finish the year, the order pace was pretty good. I mean, the early indication that October was decent again, a solid growth. A number for that green line on the Chart 12, the concern is clearly around Commercial and Residential in Asia after China is really starting to pullback in some of the funding, but I feel good about it right now, so the new Rocket, the new day, feel pretty good. Jeff Sprague : Great. I will leave it there. Enjoy the puppy. Best of luck. David Farr : All the best to you. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Hey, Dave. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate that. Jeff is not a bad actor, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine. David Farr : I mean, Jeff sent me a beautiful vest. You did never send me a frigging vest. Steve Tusa : I am not in the bribing management team. So, let\u2019s leave it at that. David Farr : That is not a bribery when those JPMorgan funky vests that you wear sometimes. That\u2019s okay, let\u2019s go on Steve. Steve Tusa : I am sure you want from Jamie. So just on the first quarter guide, $0.65 plus or minus, was a little bit below, where I was expecting, anything going on in the quarter that would kind of make that below average from kind of a normal seasonality perspective, because if I just do kind of the way your seasonality worked last year, you need a bit of \u2013 a bit more EPS in kind of the final three quarters to kind of get to them in point of the range. Obviously it\u2019s a different portfolio than it\u2019s been in the past, but I am just curious if there is anything in the first quarter that plays around with that dynamics? David Farr : No, I am not. Nothing right now, from my perspective, obviously, we have the currency probably on $0.02 currency hits us in the EPS. We had some things that came through the P&L in the first quarter last year that won\u2019t come back. I would say that if we can drive little faster growth, I think it will be better on the execution. From my perspective right, there was nothing going on the business. I just think that after you have a good fourth quarter, you have come off \u2013 sometimes, I am a little bit nervous about how that first quarter comes unfold, but nothing is happening in the business at all at this point in time and let\u2019s see how the orders unfold here in the next couple of months. And I will give you a better feel for it, but there is nothing going on at all, Steve, nothing. Steve Tusa : I guess when you are thinking about a lot of the management team so far giving some pretty good color on impact of tariffs and maybe you put that into the kind of price cost bucket, but what are you guys kind of seeing, what are you incorporating over the next 12 months as far as the impact from all these new list that are out? David Farr : Quickly, I am going back to the point real quick for that question Frank, just point out that our last year, our tax rate in the first quarter was under 22% this year, we\u2019re going to be probably a little bit over 25% so we have there\u2019s going be a lot taxing is going and now it\u2019s that, tax reform came through and hit us so that\u2019s one of the biggest headwinds that we\u2019ve got from the standpoint of quarter-to-quarter and now, if we can make that 25% better, that we will straight out to do, but that\u2019s the biggest headwind that we see right now in the first quarter I just want to I just Frank just pointed out. Steve Tusa : But that shouldn\u2019t impact the normal seasonality on the entire year, right? I mean, because. David Farr : No, it\u2019s not going to impact it yes, it will change, because kind of the tax rate in the first quarter, last year was little bit around 22, it was 21.6 this year, it\u2019s going be around 25% and so, that does impact that seasonality let\u2019s go back to the our headwinds right now that we\u2019re looking at is basically, we\u2019re looking a little bit over $100 million, assuming that the President does not implement the second tranche and so, it\u2019s more like a $120 million at this point in time we are, obviously, executing the pricing around that clearly, the pricing is going in it does not give you any margin, so that obviously gives you a little pressure from the standpoint we have to figure out how to get cost reductions offset a little bit more of that but pricing is going in and we\u2019re making that happen but clearly, as you well know as the number this year is significantly higher than last year, which was closer to more or like the 25%, effective cost impact to us, this year, it is going to be closer to $120 million and therefore we\u2019re going to have a much higher pricing in that margin there will be a little tag there, degradation of the margin because of the offsets from obviously the price, but you don\u2019t get leverage in that price. Steve Tusa : Does that incorporate everything on kind of all these lists today or everything is kind of okay got it. David Farr : Yes, as of today. Steve Tusa : Okay, got it. David Farr : It\u2019s all in the only thing we don\u2019t have in there right now is that the President makes the decision and that most recently as he said that he may increase it to 25% and on January 1 so that does not incorporate that, because then we do not have that, it\u2019s very hard for us to trigger price increases on anticipatory tariff type stuff so right now, it\u2019s a little bit under $125 million and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got set in motion and that\u2019s our plan is being is unfolded. Steve Tusa : Got it. Was just kidding back Jeff, by the way nothing, but respect for Jeff. David Farr : I know that and we respect you take care my friend take care. Steve Tusa : Alright, bye. Operator : The next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Rich Kwas : Hi, good afternoon, Dave. David Farr : Good afternoon, Rich. You want to complain about your order too I mean your factory number 3 in the list, you want to complain me? I got. I mean, Sprague complains, Steve complaints, Jim also complains, so you want to you will file complaint at the front of the line okay? Rich Kwas : I\u2019m going to save my bullet first, something in the future. David Farr : That\u2019s a really smart guy. Rich Kwas : Just a follow-up on Steve\u2019s question so, it doesn\u2019t include the 20 the increase of the 25%, so do we multiply this by 2.5x or if we go to 25 I mean that\u2019s probably wrong, but I mean just can you give us a favor for if the rate goes to 25? David Farr : Our rate will be around 25 this year, our effective rate was 16.6% as we showed. Rich Kwas : No, I met the tariff increase so the tariff rate for China. David Farr : No, you can\u2019t you cannot multiply, it means I mean Frank, what you think it\u2019s going to be less than $20 million? Frank Dellaquila : It\u2019s order magnitude $15 million to $20 million. David Farr : Okay. Frank Dellaquila : If it goes from 10% to 25% on the list 3. David Farr : Yes, that\u2019s, and I got to believe that he made this, the President may look at or the congress may look into which ones will go, some may go to 25, some may not go so we\u2019ll keep you informed but I would say, you probably think about another $10 million to $15 million on top of that, if that triggers, and obviously that means we have pricing that try off set that. Rich Kwas : Okay good and then on the mix of business, so it seems like for the year, at least in automation solutions more mix of MRO is still pretty healthy, some KOB2 coming in, but you\u2019re still pretty comfortable about 30 plus on a core basis for incremental margins and then, what does that assume for investments, because I know you had talked about making investments in \u201819 ahead of project activity and getting people around etcetera? David Farr : As soon as we make the investments, we have to be very selective, we make these investments this incremental margin is very important to the OCE and to the whole company and so we\u2019ll have Lal and his team will be happy to making the trade-offs and we expect them to deliver a 30% plus incremental margins and they\u2019ve got to make those trade-offs where they are going to make those because we\u2019ve got to make the investments and the support of the larger projects we have got to make the investments in the service organization as we continue to try and increase our share in and around KOB3 on the kind of business the aftermarket business so, where we\u2019re going to make the investments, we are not cutting back on that, but this incremental margin is very, very important to us and their growth rate is now up and running at a good pace, which last year start out slower and they build up so Lal and his team has to figure out how to make that margin be a little more efficient and deal with that world because we need him to deliver the 30%, because the Commercial and Residential have a good couple of years and most likely their growth rate is going to dial back a little bit and so automation solutions has to carry a little bit heavier load right now. Rich Kwas : Okay. And then last one on buyback how should we think about buyback for \u201819? David Farr : $1 billion. Rich Kwas : Okay. David Farr : $1 billion and as I, as we laid out, in February, our target is basically to do $1 billion between each year between now and 2021 our target is to get down the total cash flow back to our shareholders down to a little bit under 60% which would include getting our dividend payout better in the ratio line too, but we always believe in giving money back to our shareholders, but at the same time, we want to make sure we make some incremental investments and acquisitions and so on. Rich Kwas : Great good luck with that. David Farr : Thank you very much, Rich. Rich Kwas : Thank you. David Farr : I\u2019ll pass it in regard to Rocket. He is much nicer than us all. Operator : The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. David Farr : Hi, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Hi, Dave. David Farr : How are you doing? Julian Mitchell : Very good thank you just a first question on the Commercial and Resi solution. David Farr : I\u2019d always like to have little bit niceties before it was jumping I\u2019d like to have a little chit chat at the day here before you jump right it and ask me to go out or something. Julian Mitchell : Well, I guess it\u2019s a limited time 60 minutes so ask 3 or 4 questions. David Farr : You know, Julian, you know, there are rules to follow and rules not to follow, OK? Julian Mitchell : Yes, two questions as a good rule so I think, maybe the first one around the Commercial and Residential margins, those were down in both Climate and tool in the home in Q4. Just wandered how quickly you expect the margins to recover, particularly in the climate piece, understanding that Tool and Home has acquisition impacts through the whole of 2019? When do we get Climate back out? David Farr : I think it\u2019s going to be more in the middle of this fiscal year 2019 our pricing actions are going in based on our agreements with our large OEMs but it does it takes time and I think we probably have one more quarter of challenging margin, out of them and I think that they\u2019ve had a lot of things hit and pretty hard and they have to offset that but at the same time, they are taking the actions I feel comfortable that overall our price cost will be probably neutral this year at a much higher, higher level because when we apply north of $120 million of the pricing action to offset the tariffs and the other costs coming in so I think they probably have another quarter or two left of that Julian, and so, but I think Bob and his team are highly focused on getting that margin back and getting back up and having a good margin this year and we are banking on him to make that happen and so his organization is out there listening to them this is a year we need you guys to bounce back in and get the margin back to us for the shareholders so that\u2019s where we see right now, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Thanks and then just secondly on balance sheet usage you have laid out the buyback pretty clearly how are you thinking about the M&A environment? The last sort of 12 months have been very busy on deals do you think there\u2019s a lot of management capacity left to do a bunch more in the next 6 to 12 months? So, you think you\u2019d rather hold off and make sure Aventics, Tool and Test intelligent platforms all integrated well? David Farr : As we reviewed with the Board today that we most likely will be looking at significantly less than $1 million \u2013 $1 billion of acquisitions this year so I would say, we\u2019re probably going to be somewhere in the $500 million to $750 million at this point in time the focus of integration and the focus of delivering returns for our shareholders on the acquisitions we made over the last 2.5 years is very important so we have $200 million relative to the acquisition from the GE and then I would say, as I look at right now will be somewhere $300 million to $400 million elsewhere and that\u2019s how we see at this point time if I see anything different, we will know by February nothing is going to come out before February so, but right now I see I see that we\u2019ll do $1 billion of share repurchase, $1.2 billion, a little bit over $1.2 billion in dividends, and I would say right now, our dollar between $500 million and $750 million on acquisitions and from an acquisitions, our capital spending standpoint are down at $650 million Frank, is that right? $650 million. Julian Mitchell : Perfect, thank you very much. David Farr : Julian, you take care thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Winoker with UBS. Please go ahead. David Farr : Hello, Steve. Steven Winoker : Hi, good afternoon I know you like to ease into it so I\u2019m going to say, it\u2019s important to pause and celebrate these milestones so congrats on 62 years of increasing dividends which every company, we\u2019re able to do that so very impressive. David Farr : There\u2019s a lot of people that they give me out a hard time and Frank a hard time Frank and I had a hard time when we made the decision to reposition, shrink the company and maintain the dividend, but I felt quite strongly from this organization and for our shareholder standpoint that was the right thing to do and we\u2019re not quite has it I think, Frank and I want to see us get out of this year in 2019 and I think it is an important milestone, Steve, to support our shareholders around the world, a lot of people depend on that shareholder of that dividend including a lot of our retirees at Emerson. Steven Winoker : Okay, that\u2019s not one my questions though so for the. David Farr : I know that, that was the moment of joy and I appreciate that moment joy and I appreciate that little hug and I did see your backend, so get out of your damn question. Steven Winoker : All right so the first one is just a little more color around the 30% incremental margin in terms of the puts and takes so what I\u2019m hearing so far is price material cost excluding tariff is that, are you thinking that\u2019s going to be green for this year? And then mix sounds like it is you\u2019ve got KOB2 picking up and KOB3 as a percentage of sales sounds like it may be lower, which would be a headwind and then volume leverage and productivity versus labor inflation wage inflation just a little color for how you getting that 30% plus the investment you talked about? David Farr : So, on the price cost situation, we \u2013 I believe in the end, will be plus or minus a couple of million dollars on green, red now clearly from a pure dollar standpoint, the GP line, it\u2019s a wash but it\u2019s a little \u2013 will be a tag, could be tense, negative on the business overall as the headwind, but not meaningful headwind, relative to that relative to mix, I think the mix is, one of the United States and Canada and Latin America and stay reasonably strong for our growth next year, our mix with the KOB3, which is the aftermarket in repair and the early KOB2, our mix should be okay I start worrying about the mix for us more in the fourth quarter of this calendar of this fiscal year fourth quarter 2019 and then the fourth quarter or first quarter of 2020 so I don\u2019t think the mix is going to be bad for us at this point in time so that\u2019s why the incremental margins this year could actually be a little bit easier for our team, they\u2019re are up and running we have an understanding of the price cost situations we\u2019ve got \u2013 I think we\u2019ve got our capacity pretty well structured Frank and Steve Pelch who went through the plans \u2013 operating plans, put the capital out there for these guys for productivity, for incremental capacity so right now I feel better about the margins, incremental margins this year than I did last year and that\u2019s how I feel at this point in time. Steven Winoker : Okay and what is the biggest driver to support any pretty specific about 3.8% to 4% GFI view globally, given all these uncertainties so if you had to kind of take the biggest question that would sort of support that in your Outlook what are the \u2013 what is it that you\u2019re looking at? David Farr : The biggest support is U.S. If North America, which is United States, Canada, Mexico and the United States, Canada, Mexico continues to investments grow which we\u2019ve saw if you think about those four that entity was last year for us was 9 at U.S., 12 in Canada and 4 in Latin America if they can deliver on average, what I\u2019m looking at this forecast next year most likely around 6% that tells me that I\u2019m looking at a decent year for us and that\u2019s the at the core place if we see that happening, I feel good about it and as I told Jeff, early on my concern remains in Asia with as everybody but right now, we do not, our orders are still, Okay obviously Bob\u2019s business is struggling a little bit right now but Bob allows this business is doing better, so on the good side, North America, on the concern side, is definitely China and Southeast Asia that\u2019s how I see it. Steven Winoker : Alright, David. Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on. David Farr : Take care, Steven. All the best to you my friend. Operator : The next question comes from Nicole Deblase with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicole Deblase : Yes, thanks good morning, Dave or good afternoon I guess. David Farr : Good afternoon Nicole. Nicole Deblase : I don\u2019t even know. David Farr : You knew you did know Zorro, but you got to get to know Rocket is a cute guy. Nicole Deblase : He is super cute, so hopefully we get to meet him. David Farr : I\u2019ll guarantee you will. Nicole Deblase : Okay so I guess starting with growth in AS 5% to 8% for 2019 I think this time three months ago, we were talking about maybe 9% to 10% growth I\u2019m just curious, has anything really changed from your perspective? Or is it just some conservatism around some of these potential global growth headwinds? David Farr : So, the key issue is, I\u2019ve always \u2013 I\u2019ve talked about the 2-year window here I\u2019ve always talked about it in basically 17% to 18% type of two-year window here and so with that basic 10% last year, I\u2019m now looking \u2013 this is \u2013 I\u2019ve been in this business longtime, it is typically around the 17%, 18% a really good year would be \u201819 on a two-year basis so we had a \u2013 if I look at the two years, the first year is 10% so now it is off 7% to 8% so maybe my downside concern would be is relative to around Asia and so I still think if I was putting a number on a piece of paper right now, it\u2019s going to be around 7%, 8% for automation solutions with my concern being clearly the China, Asia-Pacific, with the whole term relative to the tariffs going on there, but I feel good so from my perspective, nothing has changed the marketplace, order pace is still pretty good but I\u2019m always concerned about what could happen with North Asia in this next couple quarters. Nicole Deblase : Okay, got it. That\u2019s fair. And I guess just kind of like elaborating a little bit on that comment you would spend a lot of time in China, talking to your customers quite often is there anything that you\u2019ve seen that suggests that we are seeing a slowdown or is this just concerns over what could materialize over the next three quarters or so? David Farr : Okay on the Automation Solution side, the answer is we\u2019ve not seen anything at all the order pace is still pretty good on the Commercial Residential, we are seeing it. We will we will have a tough first quarter, we kind of have a tough first half as you know, a lot of programs that we had going under way we\u2019re being around the environment, the government was supporting investments to try improve the environment from the standpoint of burning coal and getting into cleaner energy they\u2019ve cut that back and so we\u2019re going to \u2013 after basically I think seven straight quarters of over 20% growth in Bob\u2019s business in China the funds are now are starting to dry up and that is that definitely is as government refocuses it\u2019s investments and I would say, Bob will have a tougher year in China and our Automation Solution investments are still going forward so that\u2019s how we see the profile changing and that\u2019s where we see the negative so if you think about other companies that tied to that within the space you file, I would expect them to be seeing a similar type of trade offs going on right now in China. Nicole Deblase : Got it. Thanks, Dave. I will pass it on. David Farr : Thank you, Nicole and all the best to you. Operator : The next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Hi, Dave. Good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon, Nigel. Good to see you, Wolfe. Where you located? Nigel Coe : Grand Central can be better for me. It\u2019s great yes. So, Keith congratulations on Rocket and congratulations on a great \u201818. David Farr : Thank you. Nigel Coe : So, you mentioned China and you mentioned Europe, so the two areas that you are watching most closely for next year. David Farr : Correct. Nigel Coe : No, evidence yet of problems, but if you think about crude and you think about the U.S. dollar, what are the break points on those two? Why you become more concerned about the next couple quarters? David Farr : So, from the standpoint of the just the dollar strength, I get nervous in particularly around Europe, when the Euro gets down of toward parity we got a long way to go from there we have always structured our structure relative to our European competitors around parity again, I get a little tighter at 105 than I do but it\u2019s typically around parity so as long as the dollar stays, it\u2019s been pretty tight band here from the standpoint of just competitiveness we are in very good shape at this point in time, but I do have a concern if the dollar continues to strengthen and it gets relative to European and gets all the way down toward parity which is a known indication that\u2019s going to happen at this point in time, that\u2019s where I get concerned overall relative to, again the dollar strength hurts us in certain cases, but also helps me from our cost structure and some \u2013 from the standpoint buying, obviously commodities around the world at a stronger dollar pace so it helps me from certain respects but, my European competitors right now are not as \u2013 say strongly in focus of relative to the competitive strength as we are today and so I think that I like our hand we have made some major investments in being competitive in Europe, got some major investments under way being competitive in North America and then same thing in Asia so, from a competitive standpoint, I like where we sit at this point in time Frank and operations made some good investments that should help us as we get into 2019 and 2020 being stronger competitiveness but the dollar gets the parity, I get nervous. Nigel Coe : Okay. And then the GE acquisition I know you haven\u2019t closed it yet, but it\u2019s definitely a Tier 2 PLC supplier. Is your ambition here to build it into some extent compete with Rockwell or Siemens, or do you have more of a niche strategy here, and maybe compare it those two through the DCSs, maybe how do you see that acquisition evolving? David Farr : We will, clearly, it\u2019s a Tier 2, but we are Tier 6 before this. So, it\u2019s a step-up and I would \u2013 you give me that, weren\u2019t you? I think our focus is as I\u2019ve talked about, I\u2019m being very careful because the deal has not been approved by anybody yet in close, but clearly our focus is going to definitely be on the core process markets of oil and gas and power and chemical. In the hybrid space, we\u2019re very focused on the life science, food and beverage and mining. And what we want to focus hard on is the hard integration of \u2013 between our Ovation power platform and the DeltaV on the process side and then basically go after the sort of those islands of automation sitting out there in the marketplace that we can really go after and then also integrate that. As you know we have a couple of our own PLCs that we\u2019ve developed at this point in time trying to make sure they have a place to play. We\u2019ll get into more description of that as we get forward, but that\u2019s the game plan we want and over time, it will be an investment, but we now have \u2013 the core technologies and we have a core market presence that we can grow over time. And many of you may or may not know when we brought out DeltaV, we were number 7 \u2013 7s in the world in DCS. So, I wouldn\u2019t underestimate our ability to go after this marketplace and given our installed base around those core process markets and our installed base around those select hybrid spaces I went after, I wouldn\u2019t underestimate that. Nigel Coe : Alright, Dave. I\u2019d leave it at that. Good luck. David Farr : Thank you very much. All the best. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Well, I guess its morning where I am. How are you? David Farr : Yes, what \u2013 where are you? Andrew Obin : I am in Beijing. David Farr : Oh, congratulations. Is your office moved to Beijing, Andrew, is that what\u2019s going on or\u2026 Andrew Obin : Yes, I was going to outsource not quite, we were visiting some wonderful Chinese companies. David Farr : Good. Congratulations, and how is the weather like? Andrew Obin : It\u2019s actually, it\u2019s quite clean. I don\u2019t know if it is good or bad. I\u2019ve seen sunshine in Shanghai and Beijing, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing? So \u2013 David Farr : It\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s a good thing. I mean the investments you\u2019re making to clean up there, it\u2019s good for us. So, well, thanks for joining the call today. I know that\u2019s not easy to do, and I appreciate your interest in the company. So, far away, what your questions, my friend? Andrew Obin : Alright. Just a question in terms of capacity ramp up in Automation Systems, how should we think about over the next two years and what is that due to incrementals in those business as you sort of bring on people to deal with the backlog? David Farr : From our standpoint that we \u2013 as we ramp up both on the capacity, the capital standpoint, which we basically got a good jump on this year when we spent almost $620 million of capital, up well over almost 30% or something like that in capital spending this year. For the capital standpoint, typically that has hurt us too much from incremental because of how we feather it in, but I don\u2019t feel uncomfortable with our expansion relative to that. I think at 30% leverage, we should be able to handle the incremental investments in people and the capital. The business is there and the key issue for us is clearly to make sure we get that \u2013 get that capacity in and around the world where it needs us other end. We will slow down the capital spending this year, it\u2019d be more in the $650 million range as we tie and digest what we spent last year in sort of the incremental work that we want to spend this year. But I think, we\u2019re in pretty good shape. My concern on the capacity is basically making sure that we have it in certain locations around the world, with the U.S. in particular has been very strong. So, my North America capacity is being stressed at this point in time and we\u2019re having to add some incremental capacity here in North America, including the United States, which we need to get up pretty quickly if we want to deliver as we get into 2020. So I think we\u2019re in pretty good shape Andrew. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have an issue here relative to complaining about deleverage of other people and ramping up. I don\u2019t see that or feel that at this time. Andrew Obin : And just a question also for revenue growth, what\u2019s the impact of the latest DeltaV upgrade that you just announced. How much of that help revenue growth in 2019? David Farr : I couldn\u2019t tell this, Andrew. I think it\u2019s going to be a positive. I mean, right now, our Systems business will have a good year next year. I think that we saw our DeltaV system had a very good year. I mean, our Power business grew in 2018. We\u2019re one of the few companies that grew in the power world. We grew. We had a very strong fourth quarter. I would expect \u2013 I expect our process systems down and also with the upgrades should do pretty well. And if we do say 7% growth, underlying growth for the Automation business, the Systems business should be north of that 7%. I mean, they \u2013 I would say they should be closer to 8%, 9% or 10%. I mean, that\u2019s off the top of my head to just think about it. If we grow 7% underlying for the company\u2019s, then systems should be \u2013 those systems of DeltaV should be close to 10%. That\u2019s DeltaV, not the power, the DeltaV piece. So, I think the upgrade is going well. Andrew Obin : Yes. Thanks a lot. David Farr : All the best to you, Andrew. Operator : The next question comes from John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead. John Inch : Afternoon, everyone. Afternoon, Dave. David Farr : Hey, John. How are you doing? John Inch : I\u2019m doing well. I\u2019m doing well. David Farr : I don\u2019t know, we got a little \u2013 we got a hit, I think we got somebody was taped into our line it\u2019s probably the Russians because of the voting here going on in Missouri today. So, Russians are probably taped into our line. John Inch : They are tapping into a lot of things. Hey, just a bit of a follow-up on this GE acquisition. I realize it hasn\u2019t closed, but have a lot of these GE businesses that have been sold, buyers find afterwards they are in need of investment. Are you sort of anticipating that as well? And is the play really more of going, trying to get after their installed base, where you can maybe cross leverage a bunch of other things? David Farr : It\u2019s definitely going after installed base. They have a couple of places. They are extremely strong in the installed base. So that\u2019s number one we want to play and leverage that across. On the \u2013 this is \u2013 this company is more of a technology play from the standpoint of investing in technology is not a \u2013 it\u2019s not necessarily a heavy capital play. We will lay out \u2013 what we are going to be \u2013 when we get this deal closed, we will lay out an accelerated investment of dollars for the technology to make sure we can take it to the different process industries and the hybrid industries that GE didn\u2019t necessarily serve, but we have tremendous access to because of our DeltaV and also our instrumentation. But to your second point, it\u2019s the number one issue for us is what we want to do is tap into their installed base, take that and really leverage that with our current capabilities. But it will take \u2013 what we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to ramp up as Mr. Knight did back when we acquired Fisher and we started to build on DeltaV. We\u2019re going to ramp up our investment in the leverage of this technology and we will lay that out what we\u2019re talking about when we close it, but that\u2019s clearly the game strategy for us. We\u2019re going to have to ramp up their investment. This is one asset that I have to say, Jeff and his team kept investment going in. I was \u2013 we\u2019re pleased with the technology and the capabilities and because that\u2019s \u2013 that capital was making sure they have the right R&D, which is important and we feel good about that, but we\u2019re going to make some more investments for sure. John Inch : Okay. So that makes sense. And just in terms of the Automation Solutions business, you guys called out that September orders were up 11%, with implication that September\u2019s cadence was a lot better than the prior two months and doesn\u2019t that \u2013 if that\u2019s the case, doesn\u2019t that give you actually a little bit more encouragement for kind of this first quarter guide here, or is that more of a longer-term \u2013 those orders I guess just spread out? David Farr : No, I think the key issue for us is you got to keep in mind, there are incentive plans put out there for sales and orders and stuff like that, and this is the last month. And so the Automation business had a far better year than we thought originally, so they were gunning. I think it does. If we see another strong double-digit order pace in October and November, that makes me feel much better relative to the start of the fiscal year and then also the first half of the year. So give me how the follow-through goes, initial read on October is good and probably in line with what we saw here in September. But I want to see, October, November, you\u2019ve heard me say this before, are the fiscal year, which you have a great year and the bonus payments for the Automation guys are going to be good because they earned them. Now can they follow-through that and as order patterns stay in this 10%, 11%, 12% range for the next couple of months, if that\u2019s the case, we\u2019ll have a stronger start and I\u2019ll feel better about it. So that\u2019s how I \u2013 that\u2019s how it reads right now as you think about it, John. Okay? John Inch : Sounds good. Thanks, Dave. Appreciate it. David Farr : Yes, all the best to you. Hope to see you soon. John Inch : See you soon. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hey, good afternoon, Dave. David Farr : How are you doing? Josh Pokrzywinski : Not too bad. Just echo, everyone else is trying to crack, congrats on the new puppy as well. I guess to stick with that theme, the bottom end of the AS guidance, a 5% looks a little bit more Zorro than Rocky here. And you spend a lot of time talking about the sensitivity to China, but I guess within that, what\u2019s your sense on, if we do see demand rollover, I mean, aren\u2019t there more infrastructure heavy type end-markets where traditionally they would stimulate first. I mean, it couldn\u2019t be kind of a casual beneficiary if things do get weaker that self-fulfilling prophecy says that they would also pick backup with stimulus? David Farr : The answer is yes. And I mean, we are trying to be cautious relative to the guide and from that perspective, but my concern is I watch China, we have been doing \u2013 this is our 40th year of doing business in China. And my only concern is that if we get into a trade tensions and they decide to start saying okay, Emerson, yes, you are a local company in China, because we manufacture there. We are going to sort of block you a little bit and that\u2019s my biggest concern in China. Right now, if the China thing was moving down towards a resolution, I would sit here and tell you today that we are going to have a strong 10 plus year in China from automation solutions and that means we are going to have a 7%, 8%, 9% of total year for automation solutions, but I would like to have a little bit more time on that and that\u2019s why I am being more cautious about China, because I would like to see some resolution. I also know how they can come back and maybe come after companies like Emerson, if there is \u2013 if the tension continues to ramp up between the two countries. I don\u2019t feel that at a point in time, but I would be foolish not to be concerned about that and paranoid about that and hence I must spend time going over there and work this issue. But right now, you are right, if they shift like they are shifting away from commercial and residential right now, all the commercial and residential businesses are getting hurt. Automation typically in the past would be helped. That will be the norm. So you are exactly right, I want to see it and then I will feel it, but right now, I am just being little concerned about that the China U.S. impact. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Fair enough. And then I guess similar question on the bottom of the range, I know there is some discretionary investment in there and presumably some restructuring that\u2019s going on as well. If we hit 5% probably the world has changed to your earlier points, how much wiggle room is there on the incremental margin or kind of on a dollar cost basis, just anything we can use to conceptualize how much discretionary spend could come out if demand is weak? David Farr : Yes. I mean, the bigger \u2013 this is where the rub comes into play. Let\u2019s say the world starts \u2013 really starting to gets struggling and so we start going towards a 4%, 5% underlying growth. We are going to have to and for the people from Emerson on the phone and as I have talked you will see, if we go to that route and to your point, what we are going to have to do is start cutting discretionary, but we are going to have to cut some of that incremental investment, because what we are going to have to do is actually raise incremental margins and that would be something that we normally would do. If our growth rate slows down to 4%, 5% range, we thought that was where we are going to be, then we would drive higher incremental margins that mean we will start \u2013 we will start cutting back in some of those incremental investments I talked about earlier in this call and I have been talking about around the world. If I see this normal growth rate at more than 6%, 7% range, then we can go forward and it will be fine. We do have flexibility. So what we are watching Frank and I and Steve and the two platform leaders are, if underlying growth is going to be more in the 4% to 5% as a corporation, then we are going to have to cut that marginal and drive higher incremental margins to make sure we can grow and hit positive earnings per share growth and that\u2019s the game that we are going to have to play here. It\u2019s way too early to make that call. But that\u2019s what \u2013 those are trials that we have and we have those trade-offs. We can make those trade-offs and so that\u2019s what we are watching right now. We talked about that to the Board. I had a dinner last night with the board talking about the same plan I presented you guys here today and this is the very question that they dived in on me how much flexibility do you have around that and that will be the game we will have to play and we will have to start playing very, very fast if we see underlying growth rates going towards 4%, 5%. And so Emerson, we can move \u2013 we will start moving. Josh Pokrzywinski : Perfect, thanks. I will leave it there. David Farr : That\u2019s why I got Rocket. He is much faster than Zorro. At 14, Zorro sounds slow at times. Operator : The next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Walsh : Hi, good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon, John. How you are doing? John Walsh : Doing well. Thank you. Fun earning season to launch into. David Farr : Yes, it\u2019s kind of busy. I mean, the industry is a lot different. If you don\u2019t know all the different ins and outs in this industry, it\u2019s really hard. John Walsh : Yes. Well, it\u2019s been a good experience and it\u2019s a lot of fun. So, I guess maybe one quick modeling question and then a broader topic, but we can do the math on the acquisition impact for \u201818. Can you just kind of help us put a finer point on the acquisition impact for next year implied in the 30% segment incremental margins? David Farr : Well, we are look \u2013 yes, well, that\u2019s without the acquisitions \u2013 that\u2019s just the underlying, what we are trying to \u2013 what we want from acquisitions here is we are expecting $0.03 of earnings per share of the acquisitions we have done. And the key issue for us is the underlying \u2013 the growth rate is the incremental growth rate from the acquisition, the top line is 5 point. No, what is in that 5 points, what is that this year? 2 point, what\u2019s next year, 4 points of growth. So, top line can be 4 points of growth from acquisitions. We have a negative currency of two and then acquisitions will add EPS, but will hurt the overall margins and so that\u2019s how we have factored in at this point in time. All acquisitions, V&C will hurt the margin, because they are coming up, but they are not at 18%, 19% margin yet obviously AVENTICS, Tools & Test and Paradigm were all margin hurting at this point and will be for several years. John Walsh : Yes. Okay, thank you. And then I guess just thinking about tariffs, clearly you talked about your impact, but are you seeing any market share shifts in any of your markets? And I guess I was thinking more around commercial and residential side of the business or has there not been any big movement in shares due to the tariffs? David Farr : There has been no big movement yet. Clearly, in our commercial and residential space, there are imports obviously coming out of China that are being hit by tariffs. The question will be do those tariffs stay in place for some point in time or \u2013 and if that\u2019s the case, then you could start seeing some share movement. But clearly at this time the share has not moved and it will not move until you see some indication that they are going to stay there for a longer time and it\u2019s going to be more painful for some of the international supplier shipping stuff in, but not yet, it hasn\u2019t moved yet. And I don\u2019t think we will start seeing that until \u2013 if the tariffs stay in place well into 2019, then I think you will start seeing some shifts, but it\u2019s got to be well into 2019. John Walsh : Great. Thank you. David Farr : All the best to you. Again I want to thank everybody for joining us today. It was an exceptional year in 2018. I want to thank the organization around the world for Emerson and you did a great job. Just take a deep breath. Say congratulations and now we are moving on to 2019. And as you can tell from this call here, our investors are keenly interested in us having a very strong 2019 and I fundamentally believe we have the opportunity to do that again in 2019. So with that, goodbye and everyone have a good luck. Thank you. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Reeves. Please go ahead, sir Timothy Reeves : Thank you very much. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Welcome to Emerson's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Please follow along in the slide presentation, which is available on our website. I'll start with the first quarter summary on Slide 3. Sales in the first quarter of $4.1 billion increased 9% with underlying sales of 4.5%. End markets remained strong for us globally with the notable exception of our heating and air conditioning business in Asia. Commercial & Residential Solutions was down 1% underlying and was up 7%, excluding the Climate Asia business. Automation Solutions was up 7%. Trailing 3-month underlying orders remained in the 5% to 10% expected range through the quarter with December, up 7%. GAAP EPS was $0.74, up 21%, and stronger than our guidance in November. First quarter cash flow was down versus prior year, impacted by accounts payable and accruals timing, which is expected to reverse in 2019. We repurchased $800 million of shares in the quarter. And through January, we've completed our $1 billion repurchase target for the full year, acquiring more than 15.7 million shares.  Turning now to Slide 4. First quarter gross margin was up 20 basis points on higher sales, and EBIT margin was up 110 basis points, including 50 basis points of dilution from the Aventics and Tools & Test acquisitions. Leverage on higher sales, lower incentive comp and favorable other deductions drove strong EBIT margin performance. A tax rate of 20.9% benefited from several favorable discrete items in the quarter.  Turning now to Slide 5. The first quarter underlying sales growth was led by the Americas, where growth was strong across both Emerson platforms. David Farr : And I would like to call out my Latin America team, who I've been pretty tough on the last three years relative to their negative growth, but I said to them, \"If you guys delivered 10-plus percent growth this quarter and each quarters after, I'll call you out in the call.\" But again, I want to thank all the Latin America team for making it happen, and I look forward to seeing this continue at, at least 10-plus percent for the rest of this fiscal year. Thank you. Timothy Reeves : The Automation Solutions in Latin America was up double digits, and Commercial & Residential Solutions up mid-single digits. Europe growth was stable across both platforms, and Q1 marked the third quarter of steady growth of Automation Solutions and the ninth quarter for Commercial & Residential Solutions' steady growth in Europe. Asia, Middle East and Africa was down 2% due to the Asia Climate business, which was down more than 20% on slower heating and air-conditioning markets.  Turning now to Slide 6. Total segment margin was down 110 basis points and was down 50 basis points, excluding the Aventics and Tools & Test acquisitions. Segment margin declined due to unfavorable price/cost impact at Commercial & Residential Solutions and certain timing items that impacted Automation Solutions. This was in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect the 2019 segment leverage target of 30%, excluding the Aventics and Tools & Test acquisitions. Capital expenditures were up as we made progress on previously announced facility expansions and upgrades in our Climate Technologies, Final Control and Measurement & Analytical instrumentation businesses in the U.S., China and Southeast Asia. Trade working capital improved 10 basis points, driven by receivables and inventory performance. Turning now to Slide 7. Let's talk about Automation Solutions, where underlying sales were up 9% in the quarter -- sorry, underlying -- Automation Solutions sales were up 9% and up 7% on an underlying basis. December trailing 3-month underlying orders were up 12%, and December backlog increased modestly versus September on strong December bookings and a successful enterprise system upgrade across the business that resulted in the planned loss of several shipping days, the impact of which was approximately 1 point of growth in the quarter.  Strong demand for MRO and Brownfield upgrade and expansion projects continued to drive growth. All world areas were positive, and we continue to see favorable trends in our -- in capital formation for investments in LNG midstream infrastructure as well as downstream capacity as sovereign interests trend towards increased energy, chemical and refining self-sufficiency. Segment margin was down 50 basis points and was up 10 basis points, excluding the Aventics acquisition. This improvement was driven by leverage and favorable price/cost, offset mainly by the carryover impact of growth investments that were ramped up in the second half of 2018. These investments were to expand KOB1 project capacity and our global service organization capabilities. The incremental impact of these investments was approximately $20 million in the first quarter and will lessen as we go through the year and comparisons normalize. In addition, the new revenue recognition rules reduced sales and profits in our software business by approximately $6 million which we will recover in the year. This is the adoption of new software -- of revenue recognition accounting rules. For the full year, we continue to expect incremental margins of 30%, excluding the Aventics acquisition. Turning now to Slide 8. Commercial & Residential Solutions' underlying sales were down 1% in the quarter. December trailing 3-month underlying orders were down 2%. The decline in Commercial & Residential Solutions was driven by slower heating and air-conditioning markets in China, a trend that began in mid-2018. Importantly, we see a path to return the growth in the second half of 2019 as comparisons ease and spending recovers in China. Growth in the Americas was driven by strong demand in cold chain and residential air-conditioning markets and solid momentum in professional tools markets. Margin decreased 150 basis points, excluding the Tools & Test acquisition, due mainly to unfavorable price/cost, which was in line with our expectation for the quarter.  We expect that the price/cost trend will reverse and provide a tailwind to margins in the second half of 2019. Over the past year, we've successfully implemented price increases behind strong material cost inflation and tariff headwinds. Going forward, we expect pricing actions to catch up and to outpace material inflation as cost pressures ease. For 2019, we continue to expect full year incremental margin of 30%, excluding the Tools & Test acquisition. Let's turn now to Slide 9. Our 2019 guidance framework is updated to include the impact of recent acquisitions and provides our second quarter expectations. Underlying sales guidance remains unchanged, and the net sales guidance is updated to reflect the impact of the A.E. Valves acquisition, which closed in December; and the GE Intelligent Platforms acquisition, which closed at the end of January.  The EPS guidance range has increased $0.05 for the first quarter tailwinds and includes $0.03 dilution from recent acquisitions, which mostly hits us in the second quarter. We expect the full year tax rate to be 24% to 25%.  In the second quarter, we expect 6.5% underlying sales growth and EPS of $0.84, plus or minus $0.02. The EPS guidance builds in $0.02 of headwinds from recent acquisitions.  So please turn to Slide 10, and I will hand the call over to Mr. David Farr. David Farr : Tim, thank you very much. I appreciate everyone joining us today, and I also look forward to talking and meeting all of our key investors in New York City on February 14, 2019. If you have not signed up for the meeting, please do right away because we do have limited space where we're having the meeting in the New York Stock Exchange. I also want to thank all of the global employees, especially our new acquisitions members, who are learning to work and play -- and plan month-to-month like we do within Emerson. These are great additions, and I truly appreciate the support and efforts you're putting forth, be at the Pentair Valves & Controls business; be it Aventics; be it the Textron; Greenlee tool and Klauke; now the A.E. Valves in Belgium; and now our newest member, the GE Intelligent Platforms in VA, Virginia, and Germany and worldwide. I will also be visiting -- for you GE people, I'll be visiting Charlottesville in March 1 to see what's going on and get an update first-hand. So if you look at Slide 10, the first thing you've got to know is Rocket got his first Emerson stock certificate last night. It was his fifth anniversary, and so we've issued a share and he got that. He got pretty excited about that, you can see. And unfortunately, he's not very good with the crayon quite yet, but we're still teaching him how to do that.  You can see from the orders, our order trend line is in line with what we've been talking about starting last year, this 5% to 10% range. Please keep in mind that we will bounce within this range, sometimes at the high end, sometimes the low end. And don't be surprised like last year, we could touch bottom or even slip out for a month or so. It's a way orders go in lumpiness.  You'll also notice that the preliminary January numbers, which we -- we're just getting in. I thank Frank and his team for pushing this to get this information to us, but they're in line with the overall trend line, around the 7% range. Also, both Commercial & Residential has ticked up and moving up towards the positive line, and Automation Solutions numbers stay at the high elevated layer but still doing extremely well and trending very much like we thought when we talked to you in November. You will remember, I talked to you about a slowdown in China. I talked to you about a slowdown in Asia-Pacific. I talked to you about what we saw happening since June of 2018. And it's been baked into our schedule, and we are starting to -- and we'll talk further about the sort of upturn that we're starting to see in Bob Sharp's business, in particular, around the commercial -- climate technology businesses in China and Asia-Pacific. We went out in a Chart 11 earlier this month with information to counter misinformation based on the media's drive to drive a recession in North America. As you can see, our global orders in Automation Solutions have been trending quite strongly across broad base, and I'll have more to say about that. But I think you know what we saw in the last 3 months, plus 12% across all areas.  I would like -- happy and tell you today, too, I heard Golden Pass is going to move forward a big Exxon project with Qatar. I understand it's a big part of Exxon's big expenditure in North America of over $50 billion. And clearly, we'll be participating in that program one way or another.  But clearly, the orders are very good for us. They're consistent for us. The January order trend line is moving this way. I had made a comment when I was in -- visiting investors in the month of December and early January that I would communicate a little bit differently in the first 2 months around what we're seeing as I and my team are watching very, very closely what's going on in this marketplace. So far, we are seeing the trend lines we thought. We are not seeing any fundamental slowdown. We will discuss this in great detail at the presentations coming up on February 14. I have -- expand the presentations and the presenters so you can get a little bit different insight, not just listen to Dave Farr speak, which you guys have listened to for 20-plus years now, but give you some different insights. But clearly, our world area orders are holding in very nicely. Let's talk about Slide 12 and a different cycle. The cycle, as we see it right now, is slightly different from the last cycle when the price of oil was running at $70 to $100 per barrel. You can see in the 2010 to 2014 major project awards very, very heavy upstream oil and gas investments, oil investments, in particular; less in LNG; a little bit less in refining; less in chemical. As the price of oil went up, they really overinvested.  In this cycle when we're seeing the price of oil is going to be balancing between $45 and $70 per barrel, we see a different cycle. Our customer base is talking differently. They are being much more cautious, and you could see what we see at this point in time. As we look at the funnel laid out for the next couple of years, we're seeing a little bit less in the upstream oil. We're seeing more midstream. We're seeing a lot more LNG, i.e. Golden Pass, i.e. the investment that was just announced in -- up in Canada and on Mozambique. There's a lot of investments coming on the road in LNG. We're seeing more in refining, which will be out further in this cycle, not this year per se but probably '20, '21, '22. And we're seeing very good investment in chemical and life sciences. We see a much more balanced play here for us, which is good for us from the standpoint of longer-term order trends and also profitability. It is a different cycle than last cycle. We'll talk more about that. But my investors need to understand, we do pay attention to cycles. We do understand cycles. And this one is a lot different and more favorable to us from, I'd say, a consistency standpoint and especially as we drive our KOB 3 aftermarket business and trying to stay above 50%, which we have seen for the last 12 to 18 months. On Chart 13 is the trend line of Commercial & Residential Solutions orders. You could see that we saw this trend line dropping off in Asia. This is Asia driven a lot by China, and we saw this starting to drop off in the May, June of last year. We talked about it. We communicated it. Maybe people didn't believe it. There is a reason why we had a 4% at the low end of our underlying sales growth rate. We said it would be 4% to 7%.  We're starting to see this trend line move up. You can see the star on the Commercial & Residential Asia's number seeing -- trending upwards. From there, you could also see the total Commercial & Residential getting very close to 0. China is the same way.  The issue for us is we look at the last 4, 5 weeks, the week after week after week improvement, we're starting to see the improvement relative to orders coming out of China. Product is starting to sell through. The channel is being cleansed, and we're also starting to see government centers go in around the products that we sell and serve into the China marketplace. The government understands. They pull back, and they understand they probably went too far and they now are going to start investing in certain segments, which are good for us relative -- especially around heating, cooling and environmental areas.  If you look at our core cold chain, if you look at our other businesses in China, they are still growing quite rapidly. And Bob will talk about that on February 14. But there is no guarantee. But there's one thing about Emerson, as people have to understand, we do track, and this is not something that's surprising to us. We've been seeing this, and we sense it's going to trend line back up. Right now, we've entered right into the Chinese New Year, so we have little less information coming out. But clearly, what I see right now says, \"I feel comfortable with the second half that we mapped out when we laid our forecast in November for our shareholders.\" If you look at Chart 14, this is the Commercial & Residential Solutions, the price/cost expectations. As you know, we -- as we go through the cycle, we got squeezed with higher material costs. Our price/cost structure got out of kilter. It takes us time to get it back in with our large customer base. We are now moving forward. In the first half of this year, we still have not got the price/cost totally in line. It will be there by the second half of the year, as you can see in this chart, where the favorable price is now starting to help make up for the margin that we lost and absorbed and ate the cost structure over the last 4, 5 quarters. The first half of this year, in particular the first quarter, we got hit, not only the down volume, but also the leverage impact of our higher material costs. Pricing is going in. It helps but not enough. From quarter-to-quarter, you're going to start seeing, as you look at first quarter to second quarter margins, you will start seeing the benefit of this improvement. So incremental margins between first quarter and second quarter between Commercial & Residential will be positive, will be moving 30-plus percent. As you move in the second half, they will make up for what they lost in the first quarter.  We feel very comfortable about this right now. We've been working very closely with our customers. This is the cycle we go through. We know how to manage this cycle, and I feel very good about this. The same thing we said about Automation Solutions. When you look at the first quarter, our volume was slightly less than we thought because of what Tim laid out relative to the new system that we put worldwide, relative to the new revenue rec rules, relative to a couple other things.  However, when we come out of a fiscal year like 2018 where we have our highest sales in third and fourth quarter, our costs are going in. So we're -- and putting the costs in because of investments you see going forward in 2019. Then you go into your lowest quarter, we have those investments that we made in the second half of 2018 that we have to absorb in a lower volume. Therefore, our margin gets hurt in the first quarter.  It is normal. It is expected. And then as we move to the second quarter and the third quarter and the fourth quarter, Lal and his team will start delivering higher than 30% incremental margins to make up for the higher cost structure that was built in. Key point : if volumes or businesses start weakening, we obviously clearly have to take action because our volume is based on what we're laying out here, based on the orders, based on everything we're seeing at this point in time to either Bob's business or Lal's business. If the volumes don't recover, then we will start taking actions in the cost line. We do not see that. The market is unfolding exactly as we thought it would in the first couple of months in the quarter, and we feel very good about that.  If you look at Slide 15, again I want to welcome the newest members of Emerson, the GE Intelligent Platforms acquisition. It clearly is going to add about $125 million sales this year. With the accounting impacts and investments we're making, we're going to be hurt about $0.03 EPS. With the price/cost resetting of our performance shares long-term compensation plan with a dramatic drop-off in the first quarter of stock price, we've clearly had a benefit in the first quarter, and it's helped us for the whole year which helped us offset this dilution. So we raised our EPS guidance for the year. And by the way, folks, this is nothing new. Last year in the first quarter, we had a hit of $40 million on PE shares. We have a variable long-term performance-based plan in stock, and it's based in variable targets. If the growth rates go up, our targets go up. If the growth rates go down, our targets go down. So every quarter, we're marking the market. We're a little bit different. I firmly believe you have to have some adjustment to what the markets are doing, both up or down. And therefore, we mark-to-market every quarter. This is an extraordinary quarter. The stock price dropped from $79 to low $50s. And we got hit pretty hard from that point, but the benefit side is we picked up, obviously, the P&L, which is a true P&L, which we allowed flow-through, net of the EPS impact of the acquisitions. Mike and his team are -- Mike Train and also a lot of those guys are working very hard with the new acquisition here. We'll be talking to you. Mike Train will be giving a specific presentation in New York in February 14 of what our initial expectations are with GE joining our Systems & Solutions business. This is a unique technology and a capability that we're really welcoming in, and we're looking forward to building out and installing over the next 3, 4, 5 years. This is not going to be a 1-year move. It's going to be a multiple-year move. So I'm very excited about it.  So again, I want to step back and say the quarter is on line what we expected. It came in a little bit different than we -- when you look at the pieces. You look at the whole year, we still feel very comfortable with our year, both in the sales growth, our profitability standpoint. Clearly, we -- the order pace is there. From the Commercial & Residential space, it's starting to turn up. North America was strong. It's primarily China, Asia and the Middle East that was weak. And Automation Solutions is very strong around the world, which is a good thing to see at this point in time.  So with that, I'll open the mic to take some questions, some Q&A, from our participants. Thank you very much, everybody. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The leadoff is Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : I don't recall a time ever where you've broken in to Tim's script to interrupt in a shout-out. David Farr : Well, you have to understand that I was pretty upset with my Latin America team. They know that. I call them dead cats. And for 3 straight years, down orders and sales. And so I said, \"If you have to bounce this quarter, I'll let you have it,\" and I gave it to them. So it is unique, Deane. You're right. Deane Dray : That's about as big a shout-out as I've seen you do, so those guys, hopefully, appreciate that. Just on the first question, hopefully, you can expand on the comments on the oil cycle and why it's different. And you said specifically you'd see less upstream activity, and here we are in a quarter where you are seeing some strong upstream. Do you think that fades? And maybe just clarify the point about seeing less. David Farr : You know what? I think it's going to be more balanced. I think what happened last cycle, Deane, is the oil and gas -- oil companies, integrated oil companies felt very compelled to really go out and get more reserves when the stock -- the oil price was sitting at $90 to $100, and there was this huge surge of spending that was overwhelming the industry and obviously overwhelmed us. As you know, our orders and sales in oil and gas got up to well over 40% in that cycle. So I think they're being more careful about this. And also, they're investing much more in gas. There's a shift going on relative to the market -- energy use in the marketplace from pure oil to more gas, and I think that what's happening is there's more of a balanced approach here. And to be honest, I think the investors were very intense on our oil company CEOs about, \"Hey, guys, be more careful.\" And I think that we still see this good level of investments, but my look at it right now it's going to be spread out over multiple, multiple years. And I see the initial wave, and we're going to talk a little bit about this in New York. There's a lot more investments coming on the LNG side at this point in time. So it's still going to be a good number if you look at the total, but it's going to be spread out. And the oil companies are going to take smaller bites. I mean, I'll give you an example. In our first quarter, our largest KOB1 order was $9 million. That's it, first quarter. They're still -- we're still looking at smaller bites of apples, lot of KOB 3, KOB 2. The KOB1 are starting to be built out and build-booked, but they're being more cautious, which I like. I really do like that. Deane Dray : Great. And just as a follow-up, we've got the State of the Union tonight. Maybe just refresh us on the current, as you see it, impact from tariffs, anything on the shutdown. And hopefully, we can contain it to that. David Farr : Relative to the shutdown, there's been -- there's very little impact to us relative -- maybe some of our customers but not -- there's not really anything significant relative to shutdowns. I don't like shutdowns, but it really wasn't any impact at all from our perspective. On the tariffs side, it's pretty -- it's very well contained. The President has made it very clear the way he lays them out. And so as he telegraphed back in '17 and '18, we got ourselves positioned relative to cost, relative to backups, we have continued to worked that issue. I firmly believe we will not see another significant increase in tariffs. We might see a little bit here and there, but we're getting ready for it in case something does happen. But the cause -- the impact of tariffs right now is well contained in our pricing actions, both on the Automation side and the Commercial & Residential side. And so I feel that we have that pretty well set for this 2019 at this point in time. And hopefully, nothing new will come up out of the woodwork, as you said, Deane. Operator : Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Gautam Khanna : Yes. So just to expand on the project pipeline, obviously the market swooned pretty dramatically, like you mentioned, in the December quarter. It looked like people were very worried about the macros, but I did want to just get a sense for has anything slipped in your project pipeline of note? Is there any trend to discern on, things that might actually be at risk that you are seeing delays on? Or is it steady as she goes? David Farr : Right now, the project is steady as you go. What we need to watch, and that's why I'm communicating a little bit deeper and broader. I'm not going to give as much detail next time we communicate relative to the list that we did this time, as you know, Gautam. But I'm watching a lot on KOB 3 right now. That will be the sign from us. It's not going to be KOB 2 or KOB1. It's going to be KOB 3 initially. The projects will move forward. We'll do the work. We'll make awards. We'll do the -- all the FEED work, anything like that, and then that will come down the pike. We should start seeing some significant project bookings this quarter, in the third quarter, in the fourth quarter well into 2021. We're going to lay out a couple of charts for you because this very question in the meeting on the 14th which we see based by world area, where the projects, the major projects are going to flow because it's very difficult.  And going back to what Deane said earlier, this is a different cycle, and we want to lay out by industry what we see at this point in time when these projects will be flown. It's going to be much later in 2019 and early 2021. You'll see this by both the systems and controls. And so haven't seen anything push yet, but I'm watching KOB 3. If the CEOs are going to make the decisions, my customer base are going to make the decisions relative to spending. Let's say we're going to spend $10 billion for the whole year. Normally, they would spend maybe $2 billion in the first quarter and then sequentially spend a little bit more. Are they going to tap that $2 billion down a little bit to see -- make sure things are okay? So that's what we're watching right now because our KOB 3, as you know, has been running quite strongly. It's what this -- our pace is right now, and I want to make sure that that's where the first sign is. And we haven't seen it yet and we're going to keep watching it, and we'll keep communicating and we're going to put orders out and talking to investors, so we'll get a feel for it. But that's where you're going to see it first, okay? Gautam Khanna : That sounds good. And just a quick follow-up on capital allocation. You've already done $1 billion of buyback. What should we earmark for the year? David Farr : $1 billion. When we laid out our financial plan last year, we laid out x -- for a 3-year plan, $1 billion, $1 billion, $1 billion. We laid out x dollars for acquisitions. And until we see the x dollars for acquisitions, which we'll talk about when we're in New York, we're not going to make any changes. Frank and I talked to the Finance Committee and the board today about this very issue that we're seeing padded $1 billion, assuming there's no dramatic drop-off in the marketplace. Now if there's a dramatic drop-off, I will reopen that subject very quickly with my Finance Committee. But right now, assuming no dramatic drop-off, we're going to hold to $1 billion. We're going to reevaluate our acquisitions that we do here in 2019. And if we see something changing, i.e., up or down, then we'll adjust our capital allocation based on that. But I try not to adjust my capital allocation too rapidly, maybe typically I would look in every 12 or 18 months. So that's where we sit at this point in time, Gautam. Operator : Next is Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : It's been almost two years, Dave, since you did the Pentair valve deal, I think you did, around April of 2017, if memory serves me right. But... David Farr : You're right on the mark, exactly right. Scott Davis : Okay. And I think business conditions were still pretty tough for a couple of quarters after you closed that. But do you think -- are you back kind of on-the-deal model or ahead-of-the-deal model or behind? I mean, where -- what's kind of the state of the union on that... David Farr : I think we -- I'm going to ask Ram to update you guys. Ram is going to be present -- he's going to present and part of his presentation will -- just briefly beyond that because it's an important thing we made. It's a big acquisition for us. From my perspective, we are ahead of the plan relative to sales, profit and cash. Ram and his team have done a phenomenal job. The market, clearly, has turned our way. We are in a period right now which Ram will talk about is that we're making significant capital investments in that company relative to globalizing its manufacturing base, so manufacturing in the U.S., manufacturing -- better manufacturing in China, better manufacturing in India, better manufacturing in Eastern Europe, better manufacturing in Middle East. And the issue is we're trying -- as you know, we have a much more global manufacturing strategy than V&C did, and they are more worried about tax planning. So we're ahead of that. And if the orders keep holding up, which they are right now, I think I feel very good about this acquisition and the impact we're seeing relative to our Final Control business. Scott Davis : Okay. That's good news. And then just a follow-up. I don't know -- I'm looking at Chart 13 where you've got the Commercial & Resi Asia orders. I don't remember seeing... David Farr : You were looking at Chart 10 with Rocket, what's wrong with you? You have no sense of humor, Scott. That's your problem. Scott Davis : No. That's one of my many problems, Dave. Yes. If you go back -- I mean, you know this business a lot better than we do. I mean, if you go back long history, these huge order swings, late -- or early 2018, way up, now way down, I mean, are they almost -- and is it more of just massive inventory swings in the channel that the customers just aren't that -- aren't as evolved as the Western guys and make a lot of motional inventory decisions? Or is there really that much of a sell-through delta when you look at... David Farr : No. I mean, what happens is -- you're exactly right. We have these swings. We've always had these swings in this side of the business, but Automation Solutions cycle in China is typically more up for a long time and drifts back down. This business, as you well know, went basically seven quarters of 20-plus percent growth. Now what happens is the government has -- incentivizes changes relative to efficiencies, changes relative to environmental issues, and the government makes major investments in incentives into the country for the consumer and industrial workforce -- or the industrial customers. And then all of a sudden, the government makes the decision out of the blue to stop. And so what happens is the channels stopped because they see it coming, see it coming. And then also then what happens is we -- that backlogs and it gets purged. The difference between the U.S. and China is our U.S. government does not put the incentives out there that cause this. Yes, our channels buy more disciplined. But right now, the channel is being worked off. Plans have been pushed back, and what we're doing is we're optimizing our facilities right now for the next wave. In the next wave, we'll start coming as we move out of this fiscal year going into the second half of the year. So it's a pretty normal situation. I can't always tell which quarter it's going to happen, but we know it always does. And -- but this was pretty clear. We could see -- starting to see in May, in June. We're starting to hear the government is backing off. The discussions between our 2 governments have obviously created a little bit more of a tension there, too. So I think that's where we are at this point in time. But the channel is a starting to shrink its inventory, and the orders are starting to come as they start building out. So I think the cycle started. I can't guarantee anybody that. But as you said, we've been in the business a long time. We're marking our 40th year in China and -- this year. So I feel good that the cycle is just starting to pick back up. I don't see it going to 25-plus percent, though. I think until the government really motivates it, I don't see it going that high again. Operator : The next question will be from John Walsh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Walsh : Yes. So I guess a question here around free cash flow and just the timing of when you get back the accounts payables and the accruals and just to kind of set expectations on the conversion ratios going forward here. David Farr : From our perspective, I think it's going to be more in the second half. We'll start getting a little bit better improvement in the second quarter. Typically, we have a slow start. We have to work our way through it. Frank and I, we've analyzed the heck out of this thing. We have -- Frank and I have our neck out with the board and with our investors that are $3.2 billion, and the fact that we want to get to $2.5 billion free cash flow this year is a very important number for us. We will talk about it.  So I feel very good that we'll get back, but I think it's going to be more in this -- the third quarter, fourth quarter, we start seeing it. It's going to be one of these years that I think we're going to be more rear-end loaded than we were -- historically were. Sometimes, we're more front-end loaded. But that's where we are. But one thing different this year, because capital took a while -- just like spending last year took a while to get ramped up in the third -- into the third and fourth quarter, capital is the same way. So capital just got ramped up in the second half, and we had a -- we have a strong investment profile in the first half. So our capital is going to be more front-end loaded this year than it was last year. So I think it's going to be more third quarter, to be honest, before we start seeing the catch-up. That's where I am right now. John Walsh : Okay, great. And then, I guess, just maybe another question around capital allocation. Can you give us some flavor around how the deal funnel looks just in terms of size of the acquisitions that you'd be looking at? David Farr : In 2019, we have -- we're looking at around $500 million of acquisitions. And right now, our funnel would say that's about what we're going to be doing. We don't see -- we are working, courting and developing acquisitions for the $1 billion level and $2 billion level, $3 billion level in 2020, '21 and combined together. Those are definitely not maturing as fast as we wanted. But then again, we just went through a lot of acquisitions the last 2.5 years, and we're trying to digest that. So right now, it looks like $500 million this year, maybe $400 million; next year, maybe $1 billion, $1.2 billion; and the year after that, around the $2 billion range, based on what we're seeing activity that we're engaging. And I just think that the funnel has slowed down at this point in time, and not unusual, and I expect that to start increasing as we get back into the late 2019, early 2020. Going back to my previous comments that Frank and I talked to the finance community this morning is, as we look out and we're sitting in 2020 and we see the funnel still not forming enough for this $1 billion or $2 billion that we're talking about, then we're going to have to revisit that capital allocation. But we'll do that at the appropriate time. Operator : The next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : On the 2Q outlook, when we look at the acceleration, the 6.5% versus what you saw in the first quarter, I guess, just the level of confidence around that and the expectation for each segment. David Farr : I feel pretty good about the 6% to 6.5%. This is a -- the big issue is going to boil down to, historically, we look at from sequentially somewhere around $250 million to $300 million sequential. We're looking from first quarter to second quarter. We are looking at a $500 million sequential primarily because of the improvement we're seeing in commercial residential and, primarily, Climate Technology. So therefore, that's going to be something that we're staying very close to and we must stay communicating to our shareholders on because the cycle is a little bit different from Bob Sharp's business. And that -- I feel comfortable right now based on what I'm seeing. And the key issue for me is this Bob's sequential orders coming from China and Asia-Pacific continue to hold up as they are starting to build. And if they do, then I feel good that we'll make that in the second quarter. From the backlog and the order pace that we see right now in Automation Solutions, I feel very, very comfortable with that one. The wildcard for me is when you want to -- you can ask Bob in New York, when he's there, the one you're going to keep asking us, as you talk to Tim. Is -- are we seeing the China, Asia-Pacific orders come that firm up for us that gives us a little bit higher delta from the first to second quarter? That's the key issue for us right now. Nicole DeBlase : And as a follow-up, so you talked about how the cycle is different within AS. I guess, what does that mean for margin mix? So does -- like if we look over the next several years, does it mean that the typical margin headwind that you guys see from large projects coming into the mix isn't as bad as you've seen in cycles before? David Farr : I think it -- what it means is the large cycle -- the projects will start hairing our margins, but they'll take a while to hit it. They might take a little longer, or they might be spread out. It's -- based on what I'm seeing right now, it means that, as you get into the 2020, 2021 time period, if the projects fall out, while I think the impact to the negative margin will be less and less, won't be as dramatic as we saw historically. The key issue for us right now is the mix and where things happen, which industries. As the KOB 3 stays up, which is our drive, we want to get that to stay above 50%. That helps us. We're making investments to do that. So what it tells me is that our margin progression, excluding the acquisitions, should be a little bit easier this time than it was back in the last cycle. That's what I see right now. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Charles Tusa : Just a question on the price/cost stuff. I know last quarter you talked about $125 million or something like that of, I think you mentioned of like, of headwinds from tariffs and stuff. But this chart suggests that it's not quite as bad as that. Maybe I'm comparing apples and oranges. And then, am I right, as far as the price is concerned and how that phases in given you guys are like a little bit more into the component kind of supply chain that you have to generally kind of wait for the right time to go to the OEMs with your kind of annual price increases as opposed to the OEMs that can kind of dictate whenever they want to their distribution channel? David Farr : There are a couple of things here. One, we've already worked with the OEMs so the price is built in for the year along this line here. This is -- the $125 million number for the total company is still a good number, Steve. That has not changed. This is one piece of it which is, what, Section 301. And so I think what we've laid out across the board is pretty consistent, and we have the $125 million match. I think that if you -- all said and done, as we get in the -- as the year unfolds, our price/cost numbers will be slightly, I mean, neutral to slightly green, not much different. But everything is pretty well laid out. It's been discussed. The channel, which we obviously had with AS, the Automation and Solutions business, we've got that laid out. And in commercial residential, they did the heavy lifting late last year with their OEMs and got that built in. And as you -- you're right, we have to plan out with our OEMs over multiple quarters, but we've been doing this for a long time. The same thing will happen if the price -- the cost goes the other way, we'll have to plan that back out too. So I think we're in pretty good shape. I feel good about that right now, Steve. Charles Tusa : Okay, that makes sense. And then just to -- when you say -- so this basically all means when you look at kind of the comps on like acquisition-related charges, I mean, your fourth quarter comp on margins when you think about price/cost and the deals that you've kind of done here, I mean, that should really kind of unmask a really positive trend line into kind of 2020, correct? David Farr : That's in the game plan. That's exactly right. Our fourth quarter, based on what we're laying out right now, assuming we -- our order patterns happen the way we want them to happen, we should go into 2020 in a good pace, exactly right. Operator : The next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : On the project funnel you defined a couple of quarters ago, yes, I think we stood at $6.8 billion the last time you showed us the number. And maybe this will wait until the analyst meeting, but a lot of what you're talking about with KOB 3 sounds like it wouldn't really fill the funnel in with a large number of dots, maybe more dollars. But any way you could size where that stands today? Or has there been any of pause in that funnel? David Farr : Yes, I can, and we are going to give you a lot of details. We're -- I've been trying to figure out ways to communicate this, the phasing of the funnels. And not -- as you well know, none of our customers -- or competitors do this. But I think it's important for you to understand this, how we look at it. So the number's over $7 billion right now. Tim, what is the number? Timothy Reeves : $7.6 billion. David Farr : $7.6 billion. And we're -- what we're going to show you is how this unfolds the next 2, 3 years and how it goes by first half, second half. We're trying to phase that by industry and by world area. It's something -- I'm trying to help you all and help myself so I can communicate to you on a consistent basis. As you well know, it's an assumption based on what we're seeing, but we've been in this business a long time. So I think we'll come up with better ways, and we're going to try to lay that out for you in next -- in February 14. So be prepared for a lot of bubbles, and be prepared for a lot of charts and numbers like that by industry. And you may want to bring someone to write down faster with you because I guarantee I won't be giving this chart out. And right now, I think there's only one page that's going to be with any information on it. It's going to be a page with Rocket's picture, and the rest is going to be blank. I mean, so -- and I think that's what -- this is a Dave Farr approach, you know that. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Of course. And then just shifting over to some of the M&A you've done lately, obviously, trying to build out a discreet platform. You made that pretty clear last year with the progress looked like. But I just want to be clear, as we lap these acquisitions, that I would imagine, we engaging with some of these customers that maybe you guys did business with when you still owned the drives, the drives brand businesses, it requires a bit of an investment to kind of rebuild in that channel, reinvest in the product. Should we expect that to still be in investment mode as we head into next year as -- and even as we kind of lap some of the accounting components of the M&A? David Farr : Yes, we're going to have Mike put out some preliminary discussion along this line here. We see the GE acquisition -- GE makes some good technology investment in this acquisition. It's -- from a technology standpoint, it's pretty good. We've got to make some critical investments relative to not only a standalone PLC type of control or Intelligent Control. We also are going to have to figure out how to embed that with -- relative to our Ovation's platform in the power and water and our DeltaV where -- and within the process side. And then what we need to do is be able to work on the channel work. So we're going to be in a good investment mode here for the next couple of years. It's going to a huge number, overwhelm it, but this acquisition more is from a standpoint of a technology product and channel, and we're going to have to create a hybrid approach to this channel not to absorb it all within our process channel or with our power channel. We've got to -- as you said, we've got to keep that discrete channel out there and rebuild that channel. So Mike is going to be talking about what we're seeing from an investment mode in their initial changes, but this is something that will unfold with you all over the next couple years because of this is all about investment and rebuilding a presence for us to grow out of going forth for the next 3, 4, 5 years, well beyond the Dave Farr era. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : You mentioned LNG a number of times, and you've talked about LNG being a bigger mix going forward than it's been in the past. Would you agree that LNG is probably your biggest growth opportunity in automation? And would you also agree that you haven't seen much of that growth yet so, therefore, it's all on the come? David Farr : Yes, I think it is, incrementally, for the next couple of years, it is our biggest growth opportunity, and we're going to talk about that on the 14th. And yes, the projects are just starting to unfold. There's 3 been announced already, the one in Canada, one in Mozambique. We've got the project down South here in Golden Pass, which was -- it's basically -- we've said -- formally said, it's going to be funded by Qatar and ExxonMobil today. We know of at least 3 more coming down the pike. Saudi Aramco want to make huge investments in gas. And so we see a good wave relative to gas. And what we like about gas, you'll see the makeup in gas, it's a very broad portfolio of our products. So when a project goes in, it's a huge project. We could get several hundred million dollars of systems, interpretation, control software in an ongoing basis for a long, long time. And so it is something that's really good for us relative to the long haul. It's something we've built out over the years from an acquisition standpoint. So I like what we see, and I think we're going to have a good run at it here. Nigel Coe : And then addressing Nicole's question in different way, if we're going to have less upstream, less E&P-type projects going forward, more LNG, more refining, more chem, what does that do to the nature of the project in terms of dollar size, in terms of Emerson content? Any appreciable margin in things we should think about there? David Farr : We're still doing some work on the margin. It would -- my opinion, the project size, we're going to be smaller, overall, when you look them all different, Nigel, and that's something we're going to -- we're trying to size. We're still working that issue. Tim and I have been pushing our people to try to come up with that because that's a very relevant question on the cycle. So the project -- so therefore, I like the project size being small because it doesn't -- it means it's less volatile from the big chunks that you get in the business and the orders that we saw last cycle. If it's going to be heavy LNG, it's going to be heavier chemical, a little bit of refining, that's a better long-term margin profile for me. And I'm just -- we're just working our way through that right now. But it should be a better margin profile based on the big, big heavy oil type of projects. But that's something we're working on. And I want to have something to show you guys and gals in February 14 in that very, very question because it's a very relevant question. Operator : The next question is from John Inch of Gordon Haskett. John Inch : Yes, so AMS, are you still signed up for the 19% margins with the deals you've done, I think, though, as you've been talking about, it's 2021. Does that still feel about right? David Farr : We're going to push hard to get to it. Right now, if I get -- be very truthful to you, we're probably a tad less than 19% by 2021 with some of the deals. You know that GE doesn't help me because the GE margin is not plus. So -- but our target is still to get to 20% -- get that 19%, and that's what we're trying to drive this whole mix basis that we're just talking on from the last question coming out of Nigel. But that's still our goal. I still feel good that we get real close to it. And so that's where we are at this time. John Inch : And then to get to the C&RS guide, it looks like margins in the back half maybe have to exceed the back-half 2018 margins. Is that -- does that seem reasonable based on the flip you're going to see with respect to price/cost? David Farr : Yes, these guys are quickly looking at it. Frank says yes. Tim says yes. Timothy Reeves : Yes, we're going to have to ramp in the second half, yes... David Farr : And the answer is yes... John Inch : All right, so that's reasonable. And then maybe this maybe a question for Frank... David Farr : And they got to do it. For the old people out there, you guys got to deliver that margin in the second half, in the Emerson team. That's -- I just want to remind the guys who listen to this call : deliver. John Inch : They heard it. One more question for Frank. Trying to put the $63 million of corporate swing into a context. Is this an accrual adjustment for the entire year that flows through the first quarter -- or fiscal quarter? And then what actually happens, for instance, if the stock were to shift or swing up or down, I don't know, $10 to $15? Like if it went up, for instance, do you have to all of a sudden record a big double sort of expense in the corporate line? Or how does that work? Frank Dellaquila : Yes, because we have a plan where the target is very -- well, we have to mark-to-market every quarter. As Dave said, we've had big marks in the past, but this one is unusually big because of the stock price move in the first quarter. So essentially, all of that was due to the incentive comp about $60 million -- $60-odd million of it was due to incentive comp. And we've already given some of it back here. And we will give some of it back in the second quarter if we stay near these levels. And as the price goes up, we will then again have to run some of that through the P&L. So it really depends on what you assume about the stock price, but in any reasonable assumption, we'll give some of it back, but there will be probably a significant part of this that flows through the year -- that will flow through the year. David Farr : Yes, John, what we do is we look at a model based on the trend lines, and we typically have the stock going up in each quarter. And so what happens, what we build into the quarter, we thought the stock would -- I mean, we didn't think the stock was going to stay at $79, but we didn't think it was going to go to $50 -- $56. So we probably had somewhere around $75 built in there. And so as the stock dropped off, we got the big pickup. Right now, we -- if you look at the plan, we have that stock going up for the rest of this year. But right now, we've already given part it gained back. But we feel comfortable -- what we picked -- some of that, we picked up and we floated through for the year. So that's how it works. We're unique in this regard that we've always had a variable plan, and we like keeping it that way. I want to have our people -- if growth rates go up, I want our growth -- relative growth rates to go up with that and have tougher targets. John Inch : So would you expect the corporate expense to be kind of the 1 -- to go back to this $140 million, $150 million zone for the coming 3 quarters? David Farr : That's a good question. Is that where... Frank Dellaquila : Yes, I would. David Farr : Yes, John. Frank Dellaquila : I would. That's probably a good estimate in terms of where we think we're going to be in total for corporate. Operator : The next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stephens. Robert McCarthy : In any event, I wanted to ask, I guess, maybe since you're not shy and you're on the sidelines... David Farr : Who? Me? Robert McCarthy : Yes, I don't think you're shy. What do you think what's going on with the carrier and the spend here? And do you think it changes the environment overall with respect to the OEMs, and do you expect consolidation in this space from your vantage point? What do you expect to happen over the next couple of years? David Farr : My vantage point right now says the consolidation does not happen, and we'll have an independent carrier out there and that we'll be managing the similar type of customer base for the next several years. Does something happened 4, 5, 6 years out? It's possible. But my feel right now is UTC is headed towards the spend very hard. They worked this -- Mark and his team have worked this very, very hard. And I know -- by the way, I know how hard it is. I took out 40% of Emerson that way. It's a lot of work. And so that's what I feel right now, Rob. I don't see a consolidation in this move. Robert McCarthy : And yes, just to follow-up, in terms of China overall, away from commercial and resi, which is pretty clear that there's this channel adjustment that's going on, how would you say what you're seeing there? And I think in my conversations with you prior, you kind of contrasted some of your more industrial-facing or Automation-Solutions-facing business versus the more bleeding edge of consumer and residential where you would expect it a little more stable. I mean, what's your outlook there, excluding this kind of channel correction we've seen? And can you kind of talk to the growth you're seeing in China excluding that? David Farr : You take out this channel, we're growing solid 15%, 20% with this piece. I mean, Bob will show you the breakdown. I know we put the chart up at the board today because our board asked the same questions. We dissect the, what I call -- we call, the heating and cooling business within China, which is down 30%, 40%. The other two segments were up. I think, Frank, didn't you show a 20%, 30%? Frank Dellaquila : Yes, they were up big. David Farr : And for the quarter. So we have clearly built out a strong, more balanced business in China than, say, 5 or 6 years ago. But we're still not there yet because this 8 -- heating and ventilating and cooling business was up 30%, 40%, and it's a big business, now dropped off. But over time, what we're trying to do is we're trying to build up a more balanced portfolio of businesses in China and across Asia that gives us that -- a little bit more smoothing than we would see right now. It's smoother today than 10 years ago, but it's not smooth enough to stop from hurting us from a quarter standpoint. So -- but we're getting make progress. And Bob is going to talk about that because this is our investment direction that we're making to try to have the other parts of business be a bigger and bigger chunk of the Asia business and give us a little more smoothing impact. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : So in Europe, Europe was up 3% in both of your businesses in Q1, which seems like actually a good result after 2% growth last year, especially given some slowing in the major European economies. You mentioned last quarter that you see some unique opportunities in Europe in FY '19. So do these opportunities end up leading you to outperform in Europe? And do you still think Emerson grows in Europe in the 2% to 3% range for '19? David Farr : Our fundamental goal is to be closer to 5%. And there's a couple things going in Europe, from a technology shift relative to commercial and residential and then also some incremental investment. And so like, I'd say the new generational power area is different than the past as we've participated in. So our goal this year actually is to see the number closer to 4% to 5% for Europe. And that's what we're trying to get to from the standpoint of overall sales. And I think the order pattern's there at this point in time, and we feel good about it. Now clearly, we got to see this -- we got to see a little bit better number than 3% in the second quarter. It should be more like 4%. But right now, my team is holding pretty tight to that 4%, 5% for Europe for us. Even a weaker GFI number in Europe, we just happen to be in a couple of segments which are investing, and some of our customers in Europe which are exporting products to, say, Middle East and Africa, see some upside from that perspective. So right now, my Europe business looks decent. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay, yes. That would be quite good. And then you do seem confident that Asia orders have bottomed in Commercial & Residential Solutions. What do you need to see in orders here over the next few months to support that 3% to 5% sales growth that you have for the year, what kind of uptakes you would look at? Because, obviously, the deceleration has stopped, but the orders are still negative. David Farr : Yes, we've got to see on a map -- we've got to see this thing go positive in the second quarter from an order standpoint. I think we're forecasting underlying growth for commercial, res still close to flat, Frank, in the second? Frank Dellaquila : Yes. David Farr : So what we need to see is our order pattern turn up in the second fiscal quarter, which is the first calendar quarter, and moving above that line, which is pretty close to it. And so from my perspective -- and so right now, these guys are telling me, these guys, yes, we're going to be low -- plus low single digit. I was wrong. I thought -- low single digit driven by U.S. and driven by Europe. But I think it -- what I'm watching for is Asia. And does Asia get back up to that 0 line and above line? And if it does, then I'd feel very good that our commercial and residential for the year can do this 3%, 4%, 5% type of growth, and that's what I'm seeing right now, short term. I'm watching -- on the Automation Solutions side, I'm watching KOB 3 in a couple of industries. On the commercial and residential side right now, I'm watching China and Southeast Asia relative to their HVAC capital orders. So that's what I'm watching. Operator : And that question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Richard Kwas : So two for me on investment. If AS order growth continues at this pace, double digits, any incremental investment here later in the year that you have to make relative to what you have budgeted? Or is that more of a '20 phenomenon in terms of incremental investment? David Farr : If Automation Solutions orders stay above 10%, then we're going to be -- they're going to be pushing us pretty hard as we leave the year on 2 things : a global execution sales and engineering group -- service or organization group that we're going to have to start putting in very rapidly in the fourth quarter going to the first quarter, which will raise the cost from the fourth and raise the cost on the first and slow down the smaller quarter. That will be the pressure point there. And secondly, what will happen is Lal will be coming to Frank and I and say, guys, we've got to pull back in some capital and for capacity in a couple of places. And I know Lal and his team look at that. And Frank and Steve Pelch, Frank from the CFO and Steve for the COO, have this constant dialogue going relative to that. But Rich, to your point, if we see orders staying 10%, 12% for another couple of quarters, then we're going to have to do some incremental investment at AS to be able to serve that. And right now, we're not banking on that based on our forecast, but that would be good news to deal with. But that -- clearly, that will create some tension for Frank and I relative to our free cash flow and allocation standpoint. So that's what we see. Richard Kwas : And then just a bigger-picture question on U.S. resi. I mean, I know you don't have a lot of direct exposure to new construction, new U.S. resi construction. But obviously, the HVAC business is somewhat tied to that. What do see right now? There's some consternation out there with regards to where we are in the cycle. From your vantage point, it doesn't seem like you're concerned about U.S. resi, but are you watching for as you go through the next few quarters? David Farr : From our perspective right now, the upgrade marketplace has still been very strong. If we start seeing that the upgrade, the repair market, the incremental expansion of homes, if that slows down, then -- which hasn't yet, not the new homes but the upgrades, then that would bother us down the road. The channel is in very good shape right now. Our customer base is in very good shape right now. So I feel decent relative to the cycle. And as we get into -- every month -- our customers are very short-term oriented relative to the U.S. We're talking U.S. here. And so we see their order pattern month -- or week after week after week, and it continues to fill in. And Bob keeps Frank and Steve informed on this because that's important relative to us. But I'm not worried. As long as the -- if the consumers' incomes are still going up, employment still high, they're going to spend money on the current homes, which is what we see right now in the United States, which is a good thing. Are you going to be there on the 14th, which, I guess, is next week? I stand corrected. I was... Richard Kwas : I will be there. Operator : The next question then will come from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : There was a little beating around the bush or maybe not even beating around the bush to kind of trying to get to this project mix over time and how it kind of plays on your margins. One of the things you said that I thought was interesting is that you're working to keep the KOB 3 above 50% throughout the horizon. And I'm just wondering, in the past when you've got into big spikes of project activity, how far down in the mix does KOB 3 really play? And should we expect a significant margin differential because of that? David Farr : Okay. Historically, it would drop down a 45%, 46%. And we -- with the investments we're making both in the distribution organization and the sales service organization around the world, which are significant, we started it last year. Ram is doing even more this year and the next year. We have a unique situation right now where several of our competitors both on Final Control and some of our systems competitors are pulling back in certain marketplaces, and we have a unique opportunity to gain some aftermarket share. So what we've -- we're incentivizing the organization from the standpoint of making these investments and going after that installed base is to try to keep that KOB at 50%, keep a five in front of it. Will it be 50%, 51%? I'll take a 50%. And what that will do is that will smooth our margins somewhat as the bigger projects come into play. It also means we're gaining market share aftermarket. And one of the areas that we -- several acquisitions we made really did not have the aftermarket infrastructure or the aftermarket focus that we have, and so they did not -- they lost some of that business, and they didn't maintain that business. So what we're working at, Jeff, and we really we've been hard at this with Ram and his team and also Jim Nyquist, is really focusing how do we regain more and more of that aftermarket. Some of our competitors are a little bit weaker right now, and we're trying to take that -- we're trying to take it to them right now when the window's open. I think the window is going to open for another 18 months, and I've told Ram we've got to get it done. And so talk to him about this when you see him in New York. And he's going to talk about it in his presentation because this is -- this strategically long term is good for us from a profitability standpoint and smoothing out the cycle curves a little bit too. Jeffrey Sprague : Yes, that's really interesting. That's an interesting nuance. And then just one little follow-up on this investment spending question that a couple people asked. I get it if the sales are running a lot hotter, you're going to have to spend more to kind of accommodate those sales. But just looking at this year and kind of the headwind you had to kind of get through in Q1, are you at kind of run rate investments now? Is it kind of in the base, so to speak, and not a significant headwind? David Farr : Yes, we're -- as we would in the second quarter, we're running -- we're in the run rate. I think the question was, was our run rate sort of structured from an 8% to 10% type of order base here. And I think the question is that if that order pace stays at 10%, 12%, 13% the rest of the year, the consumer will be -- as we move into 2020, will have the infrastructure to deal with that? And the answer is we will have to make some incremental investments. But right now from where we see at this run rate, we're in good shape for this year. They've got to execute in the second quarter. Lal knows that. The second quarter is very important from a profitability standpoint, and that will set up a much stronger second half for us. And I want to thank everybody for joining us. And I appreciate everyone letting me have a little fun with the baseball. I don't know why it went to baseball other than Stan Musial bat right here and the Rally Monkey staring Tim down. He's got -- he's always staring Tim down. But I appreciate everyone joining us today, asking the questions and the engagement, which is -- I find enjoyable. And I look forward to seeing everybody next week in New York, and we're going to have a little bit expanded presentation from several players to give you a little bit more insight relative to our businesses, both businesses which are very strategic to us.  Thank you very much, and thanks. Bye. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Emerson Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Tim Reeves, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Tim Reeves : Thank you very much, Denise. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bob Sharp, Executive President, Commercial & Residential Solutions; and Lal Karsanbhai, Executive President, Automation Solutions. Welcome to Emerson's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Please follow along in the slide presentation, which is available on our website. I'll start with the second quarter summary on slide 3. Sales in the quarter of $4.6 billion increased 8%, with underlying sales up 4%. Automation Solutions was up 7% underlying with broadly, healthy and stable trends in most markets. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales were flat as strong North American HVAC markets were offset by a decline in Asia and the Middle East, and the impact of distributor inventory destocking and slower consumer and certain other residential markets. Trailing three-month underlying orders growth remained in the 5% to 10% range in the first two months of the quarter and moderated to 4% in March. GAAP earnings per share was at $0.84, up 11%. In the first half, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders and completed our $1 billion 2019 share repurchase target. Turning to slide 4, second quarter gross margin was down 70 basis points and EBIT margin was down 50 basis points. EBIT margin was up 50 basis points excluding the Aventics, Tools & Test and GE Intelligent Platforms acquisitions. Tax rate of 22.3% benefited from several favorable discrete items in the quarter. Slide 5 : Second quarter underlying sales growth was led by the Americas, up 7% with solid growth at both platforms. This result, while strong, was approximately 2 points lower than we expected due to moderating upstream oil and gas demand and the slowdown in global discrete automation market. Europe growth was stable across both platforms and Q2 marked the fourth quarter of steady growth at Automation Solutions in Europe and the 10th quarter for Commercial & Residential Solutions in Europe. The Asia, Middle East and Africa was flat and was also approximately 2 points lower than we expected due to the Commercial & Residential Solutions climate business, which improved in line with our expectations in China, but was slower in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Turning to slide 6. Total segment margin was down 160 basis points and was down 70 basis points excluding recent acquisitions. This was below our expectations, primarily due to slower-than-expected sales. And we are taking actions to adjust investment spending and cost structure to deliver strong leverage on growth in the second half. Capital expenditures were up as we made progress on previously announced facility expansions and upgrades in our climate technologies, final control and measurement and analytical instrumentation businesses in the U.S., China and Southeast Asia. Because of these expansions, CapEx spending in 2019 is more first half weighted compared to 2018. Our full year CapEx expectation is unchanged at $650 million. Trade working capital improved 20 basis points, driven by receivables and payables performance. Turning to slide 7, Automation Solutions' underlying sales was up 9% in the quarter and up 7% on an underlying basis. March trailing three-month underlying orders were up 7% and backlog continued steady growth driven by long cycle project wins. Underlying sales trends in the quarter remained broadly stable as follows. Strong demand continued across our three kinds of business; MRO spending, brownfield, and greenfield projects. All world areas remained positive and growth continued across our world areas stably. We continue to see healthy progress in our long cycle project outlook, a strong project funnel, steady orders conversion, and a growing backlog. There were two key areas that missed our expectations and primarily impacted growth in North America. First, upstream oil and gas was slower as Permian customers pause to assess full year investment plans in light of oil price volatility late last year and development in the Bakken region was somewhat delayed due to unfavorable weather. We expect growth to recover modestly in these regions through the second half. And secondly, global discrete manufacturing end markets were slower. The impact of this was exacerbated in the U.S. by some rebalancing of channel and inventory from last year's tariff impact and price increases. For the full year, we are lowering the high end of Automation Solutions expected underlying sales range from 5% to 8% to 5% to 7% which embed somewhat slower second half growth in North America and softer global discrete markets. For North America, we expect to low single-digit growth in Q3 and mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter supported by improving takeaway capacity in shale regions and stronger growth in our long cycle businesses. Segment margin decreased 90 basis points and was down 10 basis points excluding the Aventics and GE Intelligent Platforms acquisitions. This result was below expectation due to timing of expected software-related revenue which we expect to largely recover in the second half of the year; the impact of foreign exchange losses recognized in the quarter; and slower than expected growth in North America. We are adjusting our investment spending plans and accelerating some cost action to protect our full year profit margin and deliver incremental margin of 30% excluding the Aventics and GE deals. Full year segment margin is expected to be approximately 16.5% within the range discussed at our February investor conference. Turning to slide 8, Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales were flat in the quarter as were March trailing three-month underlying orders. North American residential and commercial air-conditioning markets were strong and our global professional tools markets were favorable. These positives were somewhat offset by the impact of distributor inventory rebalancing and slower pace in certain consumer and residential market. We continue to see improvement in China through the quarter in line with the plan we discussed at our February investor conference. However, Southeast Asia and Middle East markets were slower than expected, putting our expected Asia recovery two to three months behind plan. Given the slower than expected start to the year, we are lowering our 2019 underlying sales target to approximately 2% which embed second half underlying growth of 3% to 4%. Through the second half we expect China trends to continue to improve and markets across the rest of Asia to follow. Margin decreased 150 basis points excluding the Tools & Test acquisition. Compared with the first quarter, price/cost trended favorably and helped the business deliver over 40% sequential leverage on incremental sales in line with our expectations. We expect the price, cost tailwind and leverage on higher sales to drive strong sequential and year-over-year leverage in the second half. Full year segment margin is expected to be approximately 22%, consistent with the plan we laid out at our February investor conference. Turning now to slide 9. Our 2019 guidance framework is updated to reflect underlying sales growth of 4% to 5.5%, reflecting lower growth expectation for Automation Solutions in North America and for Commercial & Residential Solutions in Asia and the Middle East. By quarter, we expect approximately 4.5% underlying growth in Q3 and 5.5% underlying growth in Q4. Modest acceleration in the fourth quarter growth reflects improvement in our Automation Solutions long cycle businesses and upstream markets in North America. The high end of the EPS guidance range has decreased $0.05 to $3.60 to $3.70 with Q3 at approximately $0.94 and Q4 approximately $1.13. We expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 23%. Please turn to slide 10, which bridges our second half 2019 GAAP EPS guidance. In 2018 we had favorable discrete tax items in the second half, somewhat offset by $0.09 of one-time charges in Q4, 2018 including $0.06 of acquisition accounting charges and $0.03 of one-time 401(k) contribution charge. Together these items net to more than $0.20 headwinds in the second half. Strong operational contribution is weighted toward the fourth quarter, and is supported by expected volume leverage, a strengthening price, cost tailwind, lapping of the section 301 tariffs impact and actions we are taking to right size investment plans and other spending. Additionally we are increasing our full year restructuring spend to accelerate approximately $8 million of actions into the third quarter. Total 2019 restructuring has increased from $72 million to approximately $80 million and sets up a strong cost structure across both platforms in Q4 and heading into 2020. We expect the fourth quarter to deliver particularly strong sequential and year-over-year operating leverage as the benefits from the price/cost tailwind and reduced investment and discretionary spend build through the second half. In the fourth quarter these items together with a modest benefit from aforementioned accelerated restructuring are expected to contribute $0.08 to $0.09 of operational EPS. On the right we've shown our expected sequential profit cadence by business in Q3 and Q4, excluding recent acquisitions. Both businesses will deliver strong results, reflecting operational execution improving price, cost tailwinds and reduced investment spending. Please turn to slide 11 and I will hand the call over to Mr. David Farr. David Farr : Thank you very much, Tim. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I truly appreciate it. As we look at what's happened in the second quarter and what's going on as we've seen the second half, we really want to make sure everyone understands what we've seen and where we're going to go. Clearly, the cycle is still intact. We feel very strong about the cycle. But as I've said in February and I've said a couple of times as I've had investor meetings throughout the last several months the tapping of the brakes is truly happening in many of our marketplaces. We can feel it. However we've had to adjust to deal with that. As I look at the capital spending of our customers, it's still intact. We've been checking everyone's reported from a quarter standpoint and their capital allocation standpoint for the year and all their \u2013 in our discussions with the customers. They still have the capital program set in place, how they spend the timing, these things are moving, but they still feel very strongly about this cycle and I feel good about this cycle. Both Bob and Lal will comment on this as they go through their presentation, but thankfully we want to give you some insights about the Q2 and also what we see in the second half. Before we talk a bit more, I do want to thank the global Emerson team. They worked hard through this quarter as we see in the quarter unfold, the shifting of the demands, the shifting of the sales and the actions necessary to deliver what we could deliver from a sales and profitability and cash flow. It wasn't what we expected when I sat here on the phone in February and what we \u2013 and we talked in New York in February. Clearly, as Tim recognize, the U. S. was an area that we saw the weakness, in particular around Lal's business, which we'll give you some insights, but around the short-term oil and gas and also around the distribution. Clearly, we underestimated the impact of distribution pipe being filled with price actions that unfolded in late 2018 from us and from other people, as we dealt with the tariffs, as we've dealt with the material inflation. Clearly, people decided to put the inventory in place, the voice on the pricing and then now have to work that off. The timing of that work off is, I still has to be -- still has to unfold, we firmly believe they will be more closely aligned in early \u2013 our early fourth quarter or the early third quarter of the calendar year. In particularly around Lal's business. I'll let Lal talk about that. In Bob's, business we talked, incrementally margins were key for Bob and he delivered that. And he delivered over 40% incrementally. The big issue we miss, and Bob will talk about that, really was around the Southeast Asia business -- I believe, in Southeast Asia and the Middle East business. Yes, China was down. But I think we had that pretty well intact and really shaping, and Bob will talk further about that. But there are pockets of areas that we could not overcome and pockets of areas that we missed, but the tapping clearly happened. We still feel that as we go through this third quarter, there is clearly, as I would say, we're going through two big mountains here. We're going through a gap right now and I still feel good about how come out of that gap. And that's why we give you very specific forecast around the quarters, as we see this mapping out. We spent a lot of time -- I brought the teams in, both from the OCE in and then also Lal's team and Bob's team at the highest level and we sat down, we spent many, many hours several times. What's going on? What do we need to know? What do we need to do adjusting and what do we have to do? We've also taken actions, both Lal's and Bob's business taken actions and ensure we deliver the profitability with the uncertainty in case business does not come back for the second half. How do we deliver that profit margins? In addition, we've also increased our -- what I would call, restructuring charges. We're going to go after areas that we feel that we can integrate faster and with a slowdown in the decision and focus on the most profitably. Both Lal and Bob continue to look at areas and Lal in particularly has already accelerated some areas and a lot around acquisitions we've made in recent years. A couple of callouts, I want to call out. And I want to from call of the Final Control. Final Control had a very strong second quarter, both in sales, profitability, bookings, cash flow. They've continued to outperform their key North America competitors. Also I will make a special call out to my Latin America team, who I abused for a couple of years and for the second quarter they had double-digit over 10% plus growth, that\u2019s more than 10% growth across their business. That's very good. And I guarantee these guys are focused very hard in delivering that for the whole year and it's very, very important. As I look at the cost actions that these guys are undertaking, Lal's business still going to grow, very strongly. He's still going to grow 5%, 6%, 7%. I see Bob's business coming back in the second half. But clearly, that 3% to 5% range was what we thought it will be the whole year. But with the miss, in particular, around international, it's clear that's not going to happen with the whole year. But we want to make sure we have our cost aligned as we leave in this year and as we move into that second half \u2013 in the first half of 2020. And I applaud the guys for taking these actions and even when you're growing, we got to take these actions and make sure we do the right things as we focus on what's right for the long-term cost structure of this company. From the cash flow, we had a good second quarter. I think our balance sheet, and Frank would agree with that, the balance sheet Frank talked about this at the Board today. We're in a very good shape with the balance sheet. I think our working capital, we got in line, after the first quarter, it\u2019s a little bit high, but we got it back in line. And I feel very good about the cash flow for the year. If the business slows down a little bit more, it's easier for us from a working capital standpoint, but obviously, we lose the earnings side of that. So I feel good about approximately $3.2 billion. I feel good about the free cash flow around $2.5 billion, which is very important to us as we look at the total company from a capital allocation standpoint. But as we look at that second half of the year, I think we haven't focused right now what's going in the marketplace. I think we have a cost structure in place. I think feel that we -- the organization globally is focused very hard on delivering the second half. We had a good start with April. And if you look at order trend chart, from the standpoint, Bob's business kicked back up a little bit in April. He went positive on a three-month roll. Lal's business, as we expected in April, dipped down a little bit further. We're still right in that range where we were in the March three-month roll. We firmly believe that as we look at this forecast, we will be back in the 5% to 7% range on three-month roll as we leave June, and that's key. And from the standpoint of positioning ourselves for a stronger fourth quarter, a couple of things happened. Obviously, easier comparisons, but clearly, we see the pace of business picking back up. And that's what you're going to obviously watch as we look at the order trends and we communicate to you on the order trend charts. And that's what's so good about us doing this from that perspective. But I want to thank the organization out there. It was a quarter that unfolded a lot different than anyone thought. These guys reacted very quickly. As you know, I also referred to this, I have my hands in the reigns right now. I put the horse up a little bit. I got to reigns a little tighter and I think Bob and Lal are reacting, his team are reacting to that. And we have made commitment to the Board. We've made commitments to our shareholders. And we are focused very hard in committing that second half to below the year we laid out. And I want to thank everyone for doing that. I'm going to turn it over to Bob to go first, and then Lal will follow and then we'll do a Q&A. But again, I want to thank everyone for joining us today and I look forward to the Q&A and talk about what's happening. So, Bob, it's all yours. Bob Sharp : All right. Thanks, Dave. You saw the derby over the weekend, Dave pulled the reign, but the stayed in the lane as well. As you've seen, the March underlying was around flat as well as underlying with our expectation, which is in mid-February in the investor conference, we thought we'd be moving up by now. As you did see with the margins, we reacted quickly to that on the cost side and now we got the sales play out. Two key indicators to really watch, especially this time of year in these conditions. USAC was very strong, as expected. And the China recovery is playing out as expected. I'll show you that in the next chart. The key challenges we had were, as Dave mentioned, the rest of Asia, which a lot of our customers in the rest of Asia are then selling to the Middle East and a lot of it Middle East oriented. Yes, it stayed down in the 15% kind of territory, which we were not looking for. And we have some pockets of weakness, as Dave mentioned. In addition to some of the discrete products, some of the U. S. consumer-oriented stuff, disposers backs, some thermal disc kind of general product clearly saw both some inventory destocking dynamics playing out as well as some weather impact. So, again, that's really kind of what played out in March real quickly against us. April, as Dave mentioned, has ticked back to the positive. We continue to expect upward movement to support that 3% to 5% sales in the second half that we talked about as well. We look at chart 13, again the China update specifically I showed last time the verticals between heating and cooling, coal chain and tools own products because there are very different dynamics playing out. Starting from the bottom, Tools & Home Products, not a big business in Asia for us, but a solid amount especially of disposers and Ridge pro tools and you can see a very strong quarter 77% on top of a very big one in the first quarter. Cold chain, a little lighter, but there is some volatility here as you can see by the way the quarters go and still staying solidly positive. And we continue to have a good outlook for cold chain in total in Asia, especially in China as we continue to do more and solutions activity. And then Heating and Cooling which is the big trend line driver here. We mentioned it was down 40 plus percent in the first quarter improved to a 20% in the second quarter. And is on the trend we're looking for. So, China in total Q1 was down 30, Q2 was down 16%, and we do see this playing out into the positive in this quarter, in Q3, and then continuing to play out. Q4 is going to be largely driven by what happens with the heating activity that comes out and so we'll be watching that as well. If you go to chart 14, if you look across the key verticals in the geographies, again, overall some really solid strength and we're confident about the second half. First of all, North America, again, good dynamic high single-digit sales in the quarter. You hear our customers speaking very positively about how things are going and how it looks. It's always weather-dependent, of course, in the summertime, but right now, it's looking very solid. North America Cold Chain, there is a little mixed activity here and I think again when you start getting into the general industrial activity and destocking and stuff we see some of that. But overall, solid activity and some good uplift continues from some of the acquisitions we did, especially the Cargo and now the Cooper-Atkins acquisition. Global ProTools had another very solid quarter very strong quarter on 5% underlying for sales. It's quite broad. Europe was up around 7% and you saw the China numbers reflected in tools and home products very good. And -- so overall -- again some weather in labor kind of impacts in the U.S. and we'll continue to watch the construction indicators certainly. China, as I mentioned in the previous chart, Cold Chain Tools & Home Products continued strong. AC and heating -- and again, we -- this is the time of the year when the AC products are developing. Last year the customers -- our OEM customers bought into that because they expected very rapid activity once the season started. Frankly, they got stuck with some inventory when that happened when the market turned. So, they're being more shy about that. I'll say it right now; their quotation activity is substantially higher for their customers right now. It's just that they're not going to release anything until they've got the clear signal from their customers. So, this also relates to their financing capability right now. Outside of Asia, again, first half did not develop as we're looking for. We are looking for improving trends. We'd like to get even territory in the second half. But certainly the Middle East in particular has continued to have some challenges, partly probably because some of the dynamics, competitive dynamics that are playing out because of challenges elsewhere and people looking at new spaces. Europe again continues on a steady growth for us. It continues to be a story of our good solutions activity and programs in what is otherwise a relatively low growth market in Europe with the some of the dynamics. Latin America I'll give a shout out to Rafael and the team. They did double-digit this quarter. We always say we'll give them a shout out if they did that. And Canada also for us was double-digit in the quarter. So again we are watching very closely, especially rest of Asia and Middle East and some of this inventory activity. But even April has turned out in line or I'd say a little above our expectations in orders. So we're confident about how the second half is going to play out. Profit as Dave mentioned has developed as we said it would. We got in this very quick around late February and March when we saw what was going on. We saw the sequential margin. We're going to see that again in the second half. And we have a rather healthy tailwind in the second half on price, cost, which gives us some confidence. I'll turn it over to Lal now for Automation Solutions. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon. Let's turn to slide 15. As David said earlier, the investment thesis in Automation Solutions has not changed and the cycle is intact. The long-term KOB1 greenfield opportunities in front of our business continue to be very robust. We have, however, experienced a slowdown in our short cycle business in a couple of markets that I will discuss on the next chart. So on chart 15, the KOB1 greenfield project funnel remained strong. It has actually increased to $7.7 billion, an additional $100 million since we met in February. So very robust. We have booked an additional $100 million since February for total booked of $450 million and have an additional $850 million committed to Emerson. The funnel remains relatively intact with very few minor movements related to timing. The bulk of the major international oil company projects are holding as evidenced in their affirmation of capital plans in this quarter's earnings announcements. Let's turn to slide 16. There are two fundamental market changes that from what we discussed in February both impacting that short cycle business. The North America upstream oil and gas markets, and the global discrete industrial distribution market. Let's first talk about upstream oil and gas in North America and it's really related to three areas. First is the Permian basin, in which we continue to see good, well drilling activity. However, the wells are being capped and not completed. It is in this completion process of that our instrumentation and equipment is utilized. There are three reasons for this. One there was a pause given to lower oil prices, sub $45 in December; two, a lack of takeaway capacity. The current pipeline capacity utilization is running north of 96%. Although this has been an area of significant investment in the construction and expansion of two key pipelines, Sunrise and the EPI crude we'll take capacity utilization down to 88% by our Q4; and thirdly, consolidation of players. They are less independents and more of the integrated oil companies that have better capital management and cost controls. The second area on upstream oil and gas is the Bakken field in North Dakota, which has suffered from a very difficult winter in the Northern Midwest in which very little new activity took place. And thirdly, Western Canada, which have suffered from both political hesitation around oil and gas infrastructure investment and multinationals exiting. The U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast need the Canadian heavy oil, but there's a little takeaway capacity to get it there. And today, predominantly rail is being used. There are needs for pipeline such as the Keystone XL. However, none \u2013 there's doesn't seem to be a whole lot of movement on any of these. So I believe that the second half will be very positive, more positive in two out of these three regions, as majors continue to support investment and takeaway capacity issues are solved. The second impact in the margin was the global manufacturing end markets that slowed and have negatively impacted the industrial discrete distribution channels. The slowdown is predominantly the automotive and the semiconductor sectors. And the channel took aggressive restocking actions in the first calendar quarter with concerns over tariffs and price increases in January. This above -- what I call, above normal levels of inventory in the channel has extended the burn rate and resulted in slower-than-expected distribution activity, which we expect to recover in this current quarter. We believe the discrete distribution channels have started to stabilize. And as we went \u2013 as go through the quarter and expect a relatively more stable second half. A quick comment on the other world areas. Europe is stabilizing from an Industrial Automation perspective and the process automation activity in Europe remained strong, driven by KOB 3. Asia continues to be very strong, including China and India. The Middle East and Africa orders are strong, although we do have a concern around sales conversion as customers have pushed back some deliveries on key projects that we have won. And then, as Bob and David alluded to earlier, Latin America is very strong, driven by Mexico, pipeline and terminal investment and Argentina shale gas in the fields. Let's turn to slide 17. The first half growth was -- underlying growth was 7%, which is 1 to 2 points lower than we planned coming into the year, in which we assume the 7% to 8% for the year and are looking in the 6% to 7% band. The first half EBIT margins were 14.7%. We do maintain our guidance for the full year EBIT in the 16% to 17% band as discussed in New York City in February. The second half improvement is supported by volume leverage, driven by three factors. One, our backlog has increased by $400 million since August of 2018. The volume will be driven by backlog conversion in our longer cycle businesses, Final Control and systems. A number of positives in these longer cycle businesses will continue to benefit from -- that have continued to benefit from greenfield and modernization activity and grew orders in the first half. The systems business run by Jim Nyquist continues to win, with first half orders above 10%, driven by large KOB1 projects in Asia and the Middle East, modernizations and systems upgrades around the world and our modular control product families, the PK and the OCC controller have booked $120 million since launch. And year-to-date bookings represent an annualized run rate of $180 million. The Final Control business also grew orders over 10% in the first half, led by Ram Krishnan and his team and continues to outperform. We continue to invest in key capacity regionalization in North America and Asia and global service center infrastructure. The business is outpacing competition, as David mentioned. Our first half goal was 8 points greater than our largest North America competitor. Secondly, we have modest -- we see modest improvement in North America growth in the short cycle businesses, recovering upstream. Well completions as well as takeaway issues are solved and improved weather conditions in the Bakken. And thirdly, we say we expect a strong turnaround season in the North America refineries and petrochemical complexes. From a P&L standpoint, price/cost will be more a favorable tailwind in the second half of the year. Spending was originally geared at a higher growth level and our management teams around the world have responded quickly to reset priorities and cost structure and keeping us in the 16% to 17% EBIT band for 2019. Three specific set of actions : Cost-containment actions across the business, managing the pace of the remaining investments for the year and pulling up approximately $6 million of incremental restructuring in response to two opportunities, more quickly integrating the recent acquisitions and rightsizing our cost structure for 2020. On a positive note, we're happy with how April came in from an orders perspective and we believe we are well set here to deliver the second half. Thank you. David Farr : Thank you very much, Lal. With that, I'd like to open the floor for Q&A and take some questions from the participant there. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today will be from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. David Farr : Good afternoon, Joe. Good to hear from you. Joe Ritchie : Yes, thanks for getting me on. So, I guess, my first question, Dave. Maybe provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing in the channel. We heard a little bit around channel inventories being built up in Cold Chain, discrete automation. I'm assuming on the upstream side as well. I just wanted to get a bit more color about where you think we stand on that specifically and what gives you the confidence that we're going to get through that in the next quarter or two? David Farr : Yes. For the standpoint, when we say I think most of the channel relative to the short-term products via discrete automation are Bob's business or -- and Lal's business relative to some -- for the small instrumentation that go through a channel. From my perspective, it built up late last year, as the market -- as our customer base slowed down in the short term, they had a certain burn rate, which did not -- has not happened yet. As we look at this model and talking to the channel because we spent a lot of time now talking to the channel, it looks to me like this burn rate will be done by the end of our, what I would say our third quarter, which will be the second calendar quarter. So it's going to help us more in the fourth quarter. I mean we do the projection. What we see from the standpoint of our order pace and the demand out there based on the inventories. It looks to me like there will be more in our fourth quarter -- or the third calendar quarter, and that's how we built this quarter out. Clearly, a lot of assumptions relative to the business environment, but that's what it looks like and we've gone out and done a lot of channel checking to make sure we understand that, both in the tools standpoint or the consumer side and Lal's businesses, as you look at the distribution channel here. So that's how we see it right now, Joe. And by the way, I want to make a call, out to you. Your report on HVAC, the report was very good. I think you and your team did a good job there. It would have been nice if you would to talk to us. But you did a very good job there. I do understand that market. I do understand that market a little bit, Joe. We're going to talk to you. We'll give you a call. I just had to take a shot. I had to take a shot, come on. Joe Ritchie : Hey, look, I appreciate the positive feedback, Dave. If I could follow-on maybe just one follow-on question just on. Look, it sounds like the project funnel still remains a good. It sounds like you're winning some awards, KOB1 awards. I guess maybe talk to us a little bit about what\u2019s pricing been like on the project side? And then also, as you're thinking about kind of mix for the rest of this year and into next year, should we just expect the project mix to be coming through in a little bit of lower margin on the ANS side? David Farr : I'll answer first, and I'll let Lal. It's a big issue right now because that's where we are. Our backlog has been building on the project. The price of the project hasn't really changed or hasn't been an increase or a decrease from the standpoint of a competition standpoint. It depends on what the project going after, is it Yokogawa, is it Honeywell, is it Rockwell, or is it the ABB. So, from that perspective, it hasn't really changed. The projects, I would say, are starting to shift a month or two relative -- not awarding, but what I would say execution around the projects. And what we're seeing right now with the buildup of the backlog, we're going to start seeing some initial phases of projects these guys won late last year, early this year, and that will start coming through in that fourth quarter. So, as Lal looks at his mix in the fourth quarter, he's banking on some of the short cycle stuff coming back. He's got some project work coming in that will hurt his margins. But that's also why he's accelerated some of his cost actions. Because he sees that the growth wasn't there in the KOB 3 to cover the initial phase here. So, now he's got to get the cost structure right. So, let me -- I think we're in good shape. I'll let Lal comment on that, but that's moving dynamic we have right now, ignoring the distribution side, how we play this out as we move forward. Lal, do you have anything you want to add? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, thanks David. I think nothing fundamentally changed around pricing and margin expectations on projects from what we discussed in February. Clearly, project margins are dilutive to a total, but that puts the emphasis on driving the KOB 2 and 3 and adjusting the cost structure. The functionality of pricing is really around the number of jobs available in the market and the EPC capacity. And as we see that increase, we'll see less tension on pricing. But at this point, clearly, at the beginning of the way, midway through -- at the beginning of the way, I say you call it the pricing is aligned with expectation that we've had and planned. David Farr : Yes, I think Joe, I think one of the key things that Lal -- I want to call out Lal and his CFO, Dave Baker have done a great job is a team of trying to lay out as the sales unfold, the next six or next two quarters, how does that mix change? And I think they've got -- I think right now I look at it and they've got it pretty well balanced. Now, obviously, something can change the assumption. But they laid it all out and that's where the cost actions came from. We said we need a little coverage here and you need to get the costs out. In fact you need to get a little bit more than extra out in case things don't come in a distribution channel. So, that's how we -- and I give a really special callout. A quick work on this because this is a midstream change for us, but that's Emerson, that's what we do. Lal Karsanbhai : And then if I may David, Joe, one additional point. We look at all these jobs. We look at our success rate probability, our intimacy with customers where we can best place our technology and gain share will be three opportunities. All those go into the decision factor and our competitiveness on these of each jobs. David Farr : Yes, good. Thank you very much Joe. Take care. Look forward talking to you. Joe Ritchie : Make sense. Thanks guys. Operator : The next question will be from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon Julian. Julian Mitchell : Maybe a first question just around margins. Margins have been flat in both businesses for three or four years now if we include the 2019 guidance. So I just wondered when you're looking out at those goals for 2021 if you thought there was a need for a lot more urgency around extra restructuring perhaps to push those margins up in the medium term. I noticed the restructuring had gone up I think $7 million or $8 million for the current year. But wondered if you were kind of dusting off more aggressive restructuring perhaps to make sure the margins can move up next year. David Farr : At this point in time, Julian we're not -- we still firmly believe you can get back to that 19% top arrange. I think clearly we have a -- getting back for a full year into that 16% to 17% range. I'm assuming you talk about Automation Solutions here. That's going to be very key. At this point in time, we're looking at that. But if we see things not progressing from a business standpoint or mix standpoint, we can -- we have actions out there we can go after. But at this point in time, we still feel pretty good about that and we're going to go with the Board in June over the strategy both -- over the next couple of years through 2021 for both businesses and the total company and that will push us again to see what kind of restructuring we need to have. But if we have to restructure to get the margin we'll do it. So right now I don't think we\u2019ll see fundamental change. We'll just do a little bit more this year because of the mix change and the slowdown to growth and we got ahead of spending. And so acquisitions are no different. We knew acquisitions are coming. And so I think that right now we feel good about. But three or four months, we might change that course again. Julian Mitchell : Understood. And maybe just following up. You mentioned that positions there and you've mentioned several times in the prepared remarks accelerated integration particularly of the ones in Lal's business, but also perhaps Tools & Test in Bob's. Maybe just give an update. If you look across Aventics, Tools & Test, GE Intelligent Platforms, how happy are you right now with the organic growth in those businesses and that pace of acquisition integration? David Farr : Bob do you want to comment on that? Bob Sharp : Yeah. Let me start with Tools & Test. We are very happy with the way things are playing out. We have the North America sales organization together between electrical and plumbing. We are working now on the European, bringing that business close together, which is also a very big piece of business for us that will be playing out soon. From a cost standpoint, now obviously there was a lot of group cost, the Tools & Test had as a group and -- that we basically didn't even come with the business by the time we were done. We talked at the time about getting away from some of the noncore stuff communications business out in California, some hand tools stuff in China that frankly was losing a lot of money. And there's another piece right now that's playing out. So I would say everything we identify there's opportunities. We are running ahead of that right now. I think I mentioned ProTools was around 5% underlying growth in this quarter. So we're happy with the way the growth is playing out. And it's really strengthened on both sides. A lot of cost improvement of the Tools & Test side and healthy sales activity on the Ridge side, which is a good combination with Ridge profitability. David Farr : I think as I look at Mike, as we had organization session with them Julian, I like the progress \u2013 they\u2019re ahead of plan. I don't see any acquisitions in Bob's business right now, in the near term \u2013 outlook. We were out looking, I don\u2019t see anything at this point in time. But he's got his team very highly focused and there are also unique growth opportunities within his business. I feel good about that side. Bob Sharp : Yeah. I'll comment on three deals actually. Aventics, very happy with Aventics, Julian. Significant integration effort by the -- our business unit with that reports in, Manish Bhandari leads that business for us. And clearly impacted by the distribution channel comments that I made earlier in \u2013 on chart 16, as that slowed up and that forced us to drive some of the integration a little bit harder. But a lot of good work there. And I believe a fundamental part for our fluid power business in that discrete space. And second, Machine Automation Solutions. A lot of work there. We've touched the entire global channel over the last 90 days as we've gone around the world and net that very important channel for us. I've been personally engaged with the team twice. I took David to Charlottesville to engage with that team. And we are now exploring multiple synergies around the KOB 1 waves what we see around the world, where the PLC can come in and add value to our offering. David Farr : I would say that, that business is growing, better profitability. It\u2019s coming really good.. Bob Sharp : It looks very good early. And then last, I'll just, again, I mentioned it earlier, but the work that Ram Krishnan and the team have done around the VMV&C is just phenomenal and well ahead add of our plan and it continues to outperform. David Farr :  The acquisitions we're looking at in Lal's business right now are very much \u2013 we took one to the Board this morning. It's around software. And so, another software acquisition. We've done a couple already this year. So nothing big. But again, these are coming in and adding some opportunities for us. But so far, the integration of the GE business is doing really well and especially with the timing of the OCC and the PKS our own PLC, which has actually taken off and we're starting to utilize them across the board. So -- and Julian, I'm very pleased right now. The guys got their work cut out for them. Clearly, the downturn in Europe and the distribution of discrete business, automotive was not a great timing for us. But we also step back and get a chance to do things faster, so they will bounce back. And so I feel good about them right now from that perspective. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And thanks for the extra color in the slides like chart 10. David Farr : Well, we try to help you guys out, just to make sure that you clearly understand Emerson. I understand it. I just want to make sure that you guys understand it so... Julian Mitchell : All right. David Farr : Next. Operator : The next question will be from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon. And are you getting double time today, because you\u2019re in different time zone here, Steve. Steve Tusa : Good morning to you. Money never sleeps, Dave. Money never sleeps. David Farr : Well, that\u2019s got to be quote of the day. Money never sleeps. Okay. Go ahead. Sorry. Steve Tusa : But on this final one, it gets kind of silly to kind of delve into quotation activity and orders. And going back, you guys put the $850 million in kind of committed but not booked number in there. I mean how did that compare to where you were last year? Is that number like at all relevant? Or is that pretty steady as she goes? David Farr : It's relevant. It's relevant. Last \u2013 in February that number was 750, wasn\u2019t 750? 800? Frank Dellaquila : $800 million, that should, stay pretty stable, about 800 in December basically about 12 million higher. David Farr : It's up versus last year for sure. But that's the key number for us as look at it, because we know those bookings are coming at us and we know those bookings will either happen this quarter or next quarter. If that number keeps growing and stay steady that's a good sign for us, because that means the funnel is maturing and happening. So the reason we track that and share that with you is it tells us the confidence, relative to our growth and opportunity in the second half of the year in bookings and more importantly for the first half of 2020 in sales. That's a relevant number for us and that's why we track it and give it to you. Frank Dellaquila : And the KOB. Steve, sorry, go ahead. David Farr : Go ahead, Steve. Steve Tusa : Can those ANS bookings in at any point, over the course of the second half kind of migrate towards the double-digit range, or is that, you know, too high of a hurdle coming out of this lull? Bob Sharp : Right. From my perspective, I'd say we stay within the band of that 6 to 8. David Farr : Yes. And I mean it's possible you can have a three month roll with a couple of big bookings in the month and how we look at the three months roll, so it's possible. It t is going to definitely move back up towards 8%, 9% range. There are some big projects out there that are being worked on right now. They are definitely going to come. So, yes, I mean our booking pace, we like what it is right now. So I think the opportunities are still there. Bob Sharp : We got a few other in that committed bucket, Steve, if they do trigger will pull us up into the double-digit. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then one last one for you, Dave. So this kind of lull here? And I guess your outlook, is that enough to kind of knock you off your \u2013 off the long-term, 2021, I think it was like 450 or something like that. Does this trajectory or at least maybe this is like a flattening in trajectory or is \u2013 do you think that, that\u2019s still an achievable target in the out years. David Farr : Right now, we're going to debate this. Because I still feel so very good about it. Frank and I haven't talked about that. It might come differently. There might be less acquisitions. There might be different capital allocation on it, Steve. But I still feel good about it because the cycle is still there for both -- for Lal's business and Bob's business is starting to come back. So I still feel good about that at this point in time. I'm not ready to come off that at this point, at all. And Frank and I are debating that because we've got to in front of the Board next month and talk about the next three years, which includes, obviously, 2021. So I still feel good about it. Steve Tusa : Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. I appreciate it. David Farr : Steve, thanks for calling in from China. Good luck with Jamie tomorrow, okay, be nice to him. Steve Tusa : Thanks. I\u2019ll tell him, you said, hi. David Farr : Okay, appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : The next question will be from John Walsh of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Walsh : Hi. Good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon, John. John Walsh : Wanted to have a little conversation around the 5 to 7 underlying growth here for Automation Solutions, kind of what could put us at the lower end of that range and then, obviously, you kind of have already discussed the high end of the range. David Farr : I will take a shot. I think the one key issue at the lower end of the range is the channel. If the distribution channel does not come back and it takes all the way to the end of fiscal year, they work off the inventory that would cause that lower range that would put a lot of pressure on us clearly. That's the one area that we see right now. I would also say that it could be some of the projects we have booked and won that we're building on right now, get pushed out a couple of months. So those are the two things, I would see that push us back out but it \u2013 we\u2019ve done a lot of work in this right now. We feel good about it, but we're going to push and shove around the world and make sure we stay within that range. Lal, anything you want? Lal Karsanbhai : I agree, David. I think I have more confidence in the stabilization and improvement in the North America upstream market in the second half versus the first half. We could slip into the discrete channels. We're watching carefully. We miss that call, it slides to the lower range. I have confidence, however, in the strong turnaround season based on what I see today. That puts us \u2013 moves us to the upper end as well as the shippable backlog that we have in our longer cycle businesses that will impact the second half. David Farr : Okay. John? John Walsh : Yes. And then just thinking about the April orders commentary. In December, you kind of broke out a bunch of different markets for your automation business. Obviously, you've talked about upstream oil and gas. You've talked about discrete. But if we were to think about those other buckets is there kind of just the general deceleration? Or are parts of those you talked about the turnaround season and how you think that plays out? I mean is refinery accelerating? Is midstream accelerating? LNG kind of maybe some color on those submarkets there for us. David Farr : Yes, we\u2019ll try the best we can. We did not do that same initial launch out there. I tell you, it\u2019s a lot of work to break it down that way. But if I look at it, definitely refining, we see the petrochemical guys picking back -- spending back up. We now see the LNG products coming and being worked at this point in time. The early stages of some initially, they are brownfield expansion and the big projects will hit us more in 2020 and 2021. We're seeing a general pace of investments just from our companies. We see the power business which had a very strong lull in the first half. The upgrades -- their bookings have been better than their sales and so therefore, we're looking at better second have in the power area. So, we feel a little bit better pace of spending and just upgrading in the business we're seeing around the world. But that's about the only color we have at this point in time. Tim Reeves : I'll add one, Dave, around the midstream reach we have seen an uplift in activity over the quarter versus the wellhead. Clearly, as the pipelines are being built, that takeaway capacity is being built we see that. Obviously, there's less of our instruments and equipment on that pipe than there is at the wellhead, but we have seen that midstream activity strength, particularly, in North America. But I echo Dave's comments. The LNG markets are strong. We see the projects moving into FID and we're working across the confidence right now very aggressively. David Farr : Thank you, Johnny. John Walsh : Thank you for the color. Operator : Your next question will be from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please go ahead. David Farr : Hello Andrew. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good afternoon guys. How are you doing Dave? David Farr : Not too bad. Andrew Kaplowitz : Excellent, just a question probably for Bob. What do you think is going on in the Middle East market because oil prices only looked down for a brief period at the end of the last year? I think you mentioned competitive dynamics. If you could elaborate there and can you give us some more commentary on why you think the market along with Southeast Asia can come back over the next few months. Bob Sharp : Okay. I think the big thing we see in Middle East especially if we get into Saudi. The spending activity is driven by the government releasing stuff and also the government paying for the projects. And frankly that's kind of been tightened up pretty heavily to where our customers in the Middle East, they're kind of c aught in a little bit of a crunch, if you will. And then there's a lot of Chinese companies out there right now. The China market is very difficult. They're looking for aggressive places to find some business and they're going in. And with some other rotary and other kind of products and disrupting some of the, I would say, the normal space or the normal technologies and things. So, it's a combination of those two. We were there back in January and frankly, I mean it felt like it was quite stabilized and everything and we were looking for it to start moving up. It just hasn't really started moving up. In the Southeast, again, a lot of the Southeast Asia business we have is OEMs other than shipping in the Middle East. So, its -- I'd say the two are really quite closely connected. And we're not calling for any major upturn in the second half. It's really just a stability. And it's been down for awhile. So the comps just start getting easier in the second half more than anything. David Farr : And we see the money starting to free up in the Middle East. And we're getting a lot of bookings as Lal said, but the question is now will they start spending it. And so I think that our initial feel right now that money seems to be freeing up and that's why we feel a little bit more positive about it being a reasonable better second half than the first half, Andrew. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks for that Dave. And then I wanted to ask you about, you said you watched KOB 3 very closely in the past, obviously, a bit of a slowdown here. What do you think the slow down means for the cycle itself both in terms of the larger projects and actually margin mix for your businesses? Obviously, KOB1 is a little lower margin than KOB 3. How do you offset that mix impact? And do you worry that project can move to the right as you see that KOB3 start slowing down a bit? David Farr : Yeah. I'll answer first and I'll let Bob. The KOB 3 from our perspective, clearly, we've had a very solid work. It\u2019s still very good. We had a very good month, again this month. I think the key issue for us is as they tap the break on spending in certain areas in particular in the U.S. and Canada. That's clearly hurt us from a profitability standpoint. Therefore, that's why Lal has taken -- and his teams are taking the unique cost actions right now, to assume okay, guys, KOB 3 will not be as strong in the third quarter. We may have a weaker in the fourth quarter. So what does that mean relative, how do we protect our profitably and improve our profitability in the second half if KOB 3 does not come back to a level we want. And, therefore, that's why we're taking the cost actions right now. And if it does change as we move into the first half of next year then we're going back to the question I think that Julian asked us, we're going to have to actually take additional cost actions because that means that mix is changing. We don't believe the fundamentals story that we laid out, the strategy we laid out is changing. The fact that our Final Control business has been able to grow 10%, way above our competitors Final Control business in North America, tells me that we are still gaining and I still feel good about that. But any quarter or two quarters you could have that tapping and that's what we're watching right now. That's why I'm still watching it. I'm going to watch it very closely how Lal\u2019s business unfolds in this third quarter, because if it doesn't come back a little bit then he's got a lot of pressures coming at him in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year. So Lal do want to? Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah. No, just very quickly, watch that 50% number in KOB3 very, very aggressively; we work it with structured organization and programs around the world, around service MRO, service as \u2013 software as a business, service as a business for a models. But I also mentioned that the KOB 2 business is also equally important. The modernization, and we continue to see modernization programs moving forward. And those are very -- they're relatively margin accretive as well. David Farr : I think going back to the project pushout, going back to this question you asked, Andrew and then also going back to what Steve asked. If you -- when we put our orders out again, of which we do from time-to-time, if you don't see a movement up towards the higher end of that 6% to 8% for Lal, that tells us that we're seeing a percent of KOB 1. And, therefore, that's going to be a concern for us. So watching the orders and our communication around that will tell you if it\u2019s unfolding or not unfolding. That's what we're going to be watching now. I think KOB 3 we have pretty well set. KOB1 now and the timing of that's going to be important. We'll watch it real hard. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate it guys. David Farr : Thank you. Take care. All the best to you. Be safe. Operator : The next question will be from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicole DeBlase : Yeah, thanks. Good afternoon. David Farr : Good morning, Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : So maybe we could talk a little bit about the cost actions that you guys are taking. Is it possible to parse out what you're doing with respect to costs versus paring that growth investment? And how should we think about growth investments into 2020? It seems to me that this would probably be a push out investments rather than a cut of investments. David Farr : Yeah. From our perspective, I don't want to break out too much information from a competitive standpoint. But it's -- we were clearly running our investments at a, say, a 7% 8% 9% underlying order pace and therefore we've had to dial it back to be more in that 6% to 7% range. And I think that -- to your timing is, yes. Priorities from the standpoint that will be -- push them back -- we'll push them out a little bit more into 2020. I would not say, they'll go away, these are important programs, but we try not to get ahead of the growth curve and we clearly have in the last two quarters here. As you look at the acceleration of the investments that Lal's teams done. And therefore, we know are tracking to bring them back into line. We're not going to kill them, but it's just more of a timing of how this goes. On the restructuring side, that's a little bit different. That just goes back to, okay, we know the cost structure, needs to be -- we need to do this restructuring. We were talking about doing it in 2020. We now feel like we need to get ahead of this and that's why we pulled about $10 million, both in Bob's business and Lal's business. And that's how we are, Nicole. I don't want to break it out. But I think that you're reading is right. We're just slowing it down right now. We're pushing it, slowing it, so we get our growth investments in line with our actual growth. And I think that's what we do and that's what you've done with your team Lal Karsanbhai : That's right, David. And we look at this, as you know, this is how we run the business, aligning a point less, as we think around the top line today than we did back in February, required us to look at the investment pacing and pull back in a few spots, some of it will be timing. We'll see how the year develops. David Farr : Yeah. Lal Karsanbhai : And then, obviously, we do have opportunities around the acquisitions and around getting the cost structure for the -- right going forward on the restructuring side. David Farr : If you can imagine, it's pretty significant numbers, given the size of this business. Nicole DeBlase : Yeah. That was really helpful actually. Thank you for the color. And I guess just the second one on capital allocation. You guys finished with the $1 billion repurchases that you expected for the full year. Does that mean we're done? Or is there scope to increase that $1 billion target for 2019? David Farr : At this point in time we are set at $1 billion. As the Finance Committee met last night, we did discuss if the situation arise or rose that we had to do it, we'd go back in. But right now we are set up to $1 billion and we're not going to move it at this point in time. But again, that will be a topic of our whole strategy review and capital allocation review with the full Board in early June. But I would say, right now, it's set at $1 billion unless something major happened. Nicole DeBlase : Okay. Thanks, Dave. David Farr : Okay. Take care. Operator : The next question will be from John Inch of Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead. John Inch : Thank you very much. Hi, Dave. Hi, everybody. David Farr : Good afternoon, John. John Inch : Afternoon. So I wanted to ask you, if we get a trade deal with China depending on the form, do you think this leads to more orders for Emerson? I guess, in the corollary, if we don't get a trade deal, what do you think the implication is, specifically for Emerson? David Farr : I think it's more \u2013 from our perspective, right now, we don't see any change relative to a growth investment opportunity. It would be more of a cost issue for us. We have a cost reductions and then, clearly, over time that would impact our pricing too. But we would, obviously, get an advantage. But I don't see any fundamental change. I think it would solidify confidence in some of the markets that Bob serves in China, so I would say, his business will get better, because we hear that, not as much on Lal's side. Lal Karsanbhai : No. I think, definitely the consumer confidence, if you're in China, you \u2013 it's notable that people are more cautious right now on investing in homes or autos and other things. And I think the trade deal, depending on what shape it\u2019s in, or what form it\u2019s in, but with a positively viewed trade deal from China from a consumer side, I think definitely would help. John Inch : Lal, you're pretty agnostic then as to whether we get a deal or we don't in terms of the way you're planning for the business, I suppose. Is that\u2026. Lal Karsanbhai : Absolutely. John, from an order perspective, yes. From a cost perspective, as David stated, it will hurt us if we don't get a deal done. John Inch : Got it. And then, Dave, just as a follow-up here. Emerson, you're a pioneer in China, but you are still an American company. I'm just wondering given all of this, you can see the context of my question is, just trying to understand what's going on over there. Do you get a sense of any kind of a growing bias against US firms maybe on the part of the government or quasi- government customers or is there anything like that, and how are you dealing with that? David Farr : Well, I was just there. And on the front page of this report, that's the number two person at Mascom, a couple of years she came to our grand opening, we have a new tech innovation center. I was in Beijing meeting with certain government officials and customers. From our perspective, we've had a long, long relationship. We're celebrating our 40th year there as an American company. We have not seen any. Does it mean we maybe had a few more checks by government officials and reviews and things like that, yes. But I have not seen anything from our perspective. As you know, we are very, very localized, about 90% of what we sell in China, we design in China and we manufacture in China. So they treat, from that perspective, we're treated differently, but it's something we have our ears and eyes open. And just want to make sure. So I feel good about it right now. But again, the trade deal is something we do, all want to get done including from Chinese perspective, and the U.S. perspective. But I applaud our government. I'm sure to do what's right for us as a country. And I wish him well and same thing with the China as we talk with Chinese officials. There are working for the best of their constituents and I think we'll come out with an appropriate deal. John Inch : Perfect. Good to hear. Thanks, Dave. Appreciate it. David Farr : Take care, John. All the best. Operator : The next question will be from Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. David Farr : Hey, Jeff, how are you doing? Jeffrey Sprague : Good afternoon, everyone. Good Dave. How are you doing? David Farr : Not too bad. What time zone you are in right now? What time zone you in? Jeffrey Sprague : In Munich. David Farr : Munich, oh, that\u2019s good place. Jeffrey Sprague : Yes, thing is that, they got a power business, so if you are interested. David Farr : You know I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re trying to sell me Siemens power business. Jeffrey Sprague : [indiscernible] David Farr : Okay, get the questions, not the BS. Jeffrey Sprague : Well, last quarter, Dave, you are looking for baseball players. You need a hockey player, right, with this Q4? David Farr : I need some more bats right now, Jos\u00e9. I need some bats. I got some rally monkey out. I got the bats out. I'm probing everybody right now. It's a little bit more contact sport, as we say. Jeffrey Sprague : Yes. Can you help us a little bit, though, with the specifically what's going on in price/cost for you in the fourth quarter and kind of the tariffs tailwinds that you're expecting to feel there in those results? David Farr : It's going to be positive for us. I'll let Frank -- first half, obviously, was negative. And now as you look in the second half of the year, we -- both Bob's business and Lal's business have helped us. And so we're flipping over significantly in the second and the fourth quarter. In the first -- we have a little bit help in the third quarter, but really helps us a lot in the fourth quarter. Frank Dellaquila : Yes, we would expect ... Jeffrey Sprague : Is that $0.08 mostly price/cost, or is it evenly spread between those three buckets, that $0.08 delta in Q4? David Farr : We had an $0.08 on the bridge. Frank Dellaquila : Yes. Yes, it's heavily price/cost. I mean we expect to get a pretty \u2013 hi Jeff, this is Frank. We do expect to get a pretty good tailwind that accelerates out the third into the fourth quarter in price/cost in both of the businesses. David Farr : And we have pretty much all covered. If there's additional tariff -- not everything but pretty close to it. Lal's business, Bob has a little bit more. I think we are all still trying to work through that so if the President puts that additional tariff in there, we have some of that covered. We don't have it all covered and you don\u2019t have it all. Bob Sharp : Yes, well, for total price cost, it's more than covered, but we've got -- for Commercial & Residential, it was pretty neutral in the first half in total and significantly positive in the second half. Yes. David Farr : Yes, so, a big chunk of that $0.08 comes from this and it's set. I mean that's obviously -- the inventory work out there hurt us a little bit in the first two quarters or the second quarter in particular. But now we're starting to get the profit margin here in the second half. Bob Sharp : Yes, from our perspective -- from our perspective the price/cost impact is nearly 2x second half to first half. Jeffrey Sprague : Okay, great. And Dave do you -- I mean you hit this KOB3 a couple times. Do you think KOB 3 spending is kind of being preemptively squeezed out by the wave of KOB 1 that's coming? And can your internal efforts like PK and other things offset that? Is that a factor? David Farr : So, let me give you the way I think about it from a CEO perspective. Word comes out from top of the organization, \u201cGuys, we need to slow down. We need to tap the brakes on spending.\u201d The first place you go is you got a budget or a global budget say $100 billion and you\u2019re going to -- you got to take a little bit out of the first quarter and say, let\u2019s slow it down and see what happens. The first place you go is in the United States because you can control United States. It's the same thing if you look at all cost reductions all cost actions. The first place you go in the United States because we have the flexibility in the organization. So, what we saw in the last three months is as I talked about in February a little bit I was concerned about this. The word came out, let\u2019s slow things down a little bit and they tapped. And where they tap is that they tapped in the U.S. markets. So, if you look at other than Saudi Arabia, where we saw the biggest pullback in KOB 3 was in the United States and on top of the distribution. So, my fundamental belief is, the capital allocation held in the communication in the quarter if it continues to hold that KOB 3 will build back up in the late summer early fall time period and that we\u2019ll benefit from that. We're seeing KOB 3 strong in Asia. We're seeing KOB 3 strong in Europe. We're seeing KOB 3 strong in Latin America where we saw the back-off in the U.S. and that\u2019s typically how it unfolds. If you ever watch of this, we're more volatile in KOB 3 in the U.S. because that's how the CEO\u2019s control it for my customer base. Bob Sharp : Right. It's going to be 3, because KOB 1 isn't going to be paying this year anyway. David Farr : Yes. So exactly right. Bob Sharp : It doesn't save money this year. David Farr : Yes. That's how I see it Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Thanks. David Farr : Jeff, you take care. Be safe. And I do not want to buy Siemens Power business. I'll take their -- if they want to buy controls systems, I'll gladly do that, but that's Operator : The next question will be from Gautam Khanna of Cowen & Co. Please go ahead. Gautam Khanna : Yes, thanks good afternoon guys. David Farr : Good afternoon Gautam, how are you doing my friend? Gautam Khanna : I am doing well. A lot of questions asked and answered. I wanted to just make sure I understood. Just putting it altogether on the Automation Solutions side, Do you still have confidence in kind of 30% plus incrementals in 2020-2021 as we move through given all the moving parts. Project timing KOB 3 what have you, integration opportunity with the recent acquisitions, do you still feel comfortable that we're going to net to 30% plus incrementals as we move through? Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah. This is Lal, Gautam. Yes. Part of the rationale around the cost containment that we put in place during the second half and the incremental restructuring that we're executing in the businesses within the next four, five days, very important programs are a little bit of insurance policy around what's going on in the end markets and the recovery in the second half. And as we do -- as we execute those we get right in that 30% band that we've been talking about on EBIT leverage. David Farr : We issue for us goes back to the question. I think Julian asked earlier, Gautam. If you don't see the margin come in the second half of the year, we're going to have to take action. And Lal knows that because we laid out a plan. We\u2019ve got a plan for acquisition. We got a plan for the core business to get back to profitability. And if we have to -- we can't get there then we're going to have to figure out how to adjust the cost structure. Lal and his team understand that. They understand the margin business, but they also are working with the fluidity around the KOB 2 and 3 and 1 business. So I think we're pretty fluid here and understand our jobs. That's one thing we are good about. And this team sits here the same flow. We're all here together now. Lal\u2019s got his CFO and Head of HR as Bob does right here in the same floor with us and with Frank. So we can talk openly about what's going on. And we'll have to adjust if we can't get there. But I feel this guys have a focus right now with Lal and his team. Lal Karsanbhai : And as you said David earlier on, we\u2019re having a good year. We're having good year as an organization as a business. It's shape of the year has changed a little bit on us, and the short cycle, the pressures we felt in the second quarter has pressured the margins. David Farr : Correct. Lal Karsanbhai : And we took actions there. And we do have some second half recovery based on what we saw in the second quarter. And as that unfolds we'll be watching it month-by-month very, very careful. But at least based on what we saw in April that's positive. The fluid situation, Gautam, but we fully understand what we have to do as shareholders. Gautam Khanna : No, I get it. Just philosophically, Dave I\u2019m just curious how you and the Board think about that 450-ish target in a way out there, obviously, you could toggle up the buyback if you wanted to backfill. I'm just curious how you guys set the priority in terms of that financial target? Is it a goal come hell or high water? Or is it something that you'll be a little bit more flexible around. I'm just wondering if that\u2019s something you might \u2013 we consider as early as the June Board meeting? David Farr : Well, yes, we're going to talk in the June Board meeting about it. But it's definitely going to unfold differently right now based -- let's say the underlying growth rate this year is a little bit less. If we see the underlying growth rate in 2020 and 2021 then obviously we adjust. If we don't see the acquisitions then we have to do a share repurchase on this. From my perspective 450 was a realistic target when we said it last year or this year. I still believe that is the case. And the question is now as Frank and I, with the business leaders have to -- on a platform they just I have to look at this and say, okay what's a realistic being? For me it's many ways we can get there. Acquisitions or no acquisitions, share repurchase, better margins. So we're going to look at that and we'll see that unfold. We know how important that 450 is relative to our long-term valuation and it's something that we take seriously as we unfold it. So we will see what happens as we build it up here the next 30 days. Gautam Khanna : Appreciate it. Thank you guys. David Farr : Thank you, Gautam. Good to see you and talking to you again. Operator : The next question will be from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. David Farr : Good afternoon, Deane. How are you doing my friend? Deane Dray : Very well. Thanks. Just I know we covered a lot of territory here. For Bob I had a follow-up. Just a clarification. When \u2013 Bob, you commented on the fourth quarter. A lot depends on heating activity in China. But aren't you facing a tough comp on the whole government heat pump program? And so, how do you think that plays out? Bob Sharp : Well, for the fourth quarter, I guess, it's good now. But no, we don't have a tough comp. It was last spring, May, June kind of timeframe when the heating market really collapsed, for lack of a better word, in China. So the comparisons are not that difficult against that. And we're not \u2013 again, on AC and heating we're talking single-digit growth in the fourth quarter, not some dramatic recovery. The last time we came out of a cycle, it grew 40% or so pretty quickly. So I'm not -- it's not reliant on something dramatic. It's really just more a matter of the normal project, the activity happening. There's still high emphasis on the Blue Sky initiative. This is more industrial oriented. So it's less about the government releasing neighborhoods like the residential stuff around Beijing was for a while. So it really comes down to the companies having funding for this and in some cases a little nudging in some areas where the government will say, \u201cYou know, you're in a zone where you got to stop using a boiler.\u201d And if they're told that, then they either change to a heat pump or they don't have heat. It's pretty cut and dried. Deane Dray : Got it. Bob Sharp : And the problems. Again, the -- so there's \u2013 those customers or like the power companies in a region who are working with our OEMs, because they're doing a full implementation, a lot of times retrofitting a boiler investment. They are asking for heavy quotations right now from the OEMs. We see that. Again, the OEMs are just not going to buy a compressor until they know for sure that project's funded. Deane Dray : Got it. Yeah. Just, Dave, I would be interesting in hearing your take on the latest turn in the trade negotiations. And just clarify the last update tariffs were going to hit you $125 million. Where does that stand today? David Farr :  Tariff numbers, still good. As you well know, if you go back, already said this thing was going to take a little longer. I've always felt July, August was the appropriate timeframe. And so, I've never been the guy that said, this thing in May, as I publically said this and I said it on the call here. I still believe we'll get a deal done. I think the issue really boils to I think both parties are testing each leader and \u2013 on the give-and-take. And I'm glad to hear the \u2013 they are going to be meet \u2013 go ahead and meet this week. But I think this is going to take -- go back and forth a couple more times. And I still don\u2019t believe we'll -- anything will happen until the August time period. And so -- but I do believe that it will get done and I do believe that the cost will be passed through eventually. But it's something we have to manage. I can't sit here and cry and hold my breath. I got to deal with them. And so, I think, as a company, we\u2019ll be on with it and from a standpoint of the country, I'm glad we're addressing this issue now than \u2013 and waiting. We need to get on with this issue. Deane Dray : Got it. Thank you. David Farr : Thank you, Deane. Operator : And the final question today will be from Robert McCarthy of Stevens. Please go ahead. Robert McCarthy : Good afternoon, everyone. David Farr : Good afternoon, Rob. Robert McCarthy : So I got two questions. One is of form and one is a substance. So I'll ask the one of substance first, maybe your business leaders could just walk through the opportunity, particularly in the context of a long-term target for EPS around cash conversion? And is there a way for you to just have superior cash conversion above what you are historically have been? And maybe talk about the acquisitions of the businesses, the opportunities. So that could support a very high-quality number even as you fall $0.10 to $0.15 short, you might have a really strong, high-quality cash number. David Farr : You guys want to take a shot? Bob Sharp : Well, I mean for the Commercial & Residential side from working capital standpoint, we run in the single digits. The margins are obviously very strong. Robert McCarthy : Your acquisitions would be the place you work. Bob Sharp : Acquisitions, I will say from a working capital standpoint with Tools & Test, we are well ahead of working capital right now. And that's a combination of payable terms more in line with what Emerson pays to buyers versus what Textron is paying. Inventory, significant change. DSO is not a dramatic change at this point. So I would say it's cash conversion, you would say for commercial/residential has been outstanding and will continue to be outstanding. David Farr : I think work in the acquisitions you've done in the recent years is your bullet point. I think Lal\u2019s got the one that\u2019s got the biggest opportunity. Bob Sharp : No. I agree. But as we will be a run at very high levels of cash conversion across our automation. The acquisition do present us the opportunities to drive more of that, no doubt about it, Rob, as you pointed out and we continue to press those buttons. Frank Dellaquila : Rob, this is Frank. We can always do better. But I mean we consistently run well above 100% of cash flow, free cash flow conversion, and we expect we'll continue to do that. We'll take advantage of the opportunities we get from the acquisitions. But I think we run that pretty efficiently right now and we'll just continue to look for ways to improve it. Robert McCarthy : Well, thank you for that and thank you for all the substance on this call. I have a question on form, though. Obviously, Dave, this is a little different kind of call. You put your business leaders to the forefront. You put a lot of detail in about cost takeout, restructuring and then positioning for growth. Given its last season of Game of Thrones, are we seeing kind of a bake-off happening here, or how would you... David Farr : No. I ain\u2019t going anywhere. There's no bake-off going on? Rob what kind of bull? I am not going anywhere, there no bake-off. No, there's no bake-off. Robert McCarthy : But I guess in all seriousness, was this prompted by the environment and you felt you needed to get your leaders on the phone, or is this just something to raise the aggregate profile? David Farr : No. There's two reasons we did this. One, I felt very importantly, given that what we were there in February talking to investors and talking to the sell side also and investors, we laid out a plan. And I felt the plan\u2019s changed. I thought it was very -- it's one thing I can sit here consider and communicate this, you know I can sit here and communicate this, but I think it\u2019s very important for the comfort of the investors to know that the business, the two platform leaders, Bob and Lal, are engaged and they're working this thing in unison with both Frank and myself to deliver what we're trying to deliver for the whole corporation, for the company and for their shareholders. It's important for me to engage them. It's also important for me to give the -- everyone a chance that at a leadership level like Lal and Bob\u2019s at, they have a chance to interact and explain and have this experience that we go through, that we're sitting here under the microscope at both at the board level. I did the same thing with the Board today and then also from the standpoint of the investors These two guys have been operating businesses at Emerson. They don't need to be baked-off. I know how they perform. And they perform extremely well. So it was all about trying to help you all to have information to make a better decision on the value, long-term capabilities of Emerson. And by the way, it's not 2021 yet, Jos\u00e9. It's still  2019. Robert McCarthy : Understood. A - David Farr : Take care my friend. And I want to thank everyone for joining us. I want to thanks Lal, I want to thank Bob, Frank, and Tim. It was a different approach and we wanted just, as I said earlier, just to give a chance \u2013 everyone have a chance to see what's going on and I want to thank the organization and I look forward to a very strong Q3 as we execute. So, thank you very much everybody. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

During today\u2019s presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. This conference is being recorded today, August 6, 2019. Emerson\u2019s commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the Company\u2019s outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson\u2019s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Tim Reeves, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead. Tim Reeves : Thank you, Allison. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Welcome to Emerson\u2019s Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Please follow along in the slide presentation, which is available on our website. I\u2019ll start with the third quarter summary on Slide 3. Sales in the quarter of $4.7 billion increased 5%, and underlying sales were up 2%. Growth was below our guidance across both businesses. Underlying orders were up 2% in June, also below the 5% to 7% expectation we discussed during the second quarter earnings conference call on May 7. Automation Solutions\u2019 underlying sales were up 3% and orders up 4% in the quarter. We had expected global discrete channel inventories to clear and demand to recover, but instead discrete end markets further decelerated in the quarter. North American upstream oil and gas demand have yet to improve. Demand in process and hybrid end markets, however was stable in North America and continued to be robust elsewhere. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales and orders were down 1% in the quarter, primarily driven by cooler wet weather conditions in North America. GAAP EPS was $0.97 and was $0.94 up 7%, excluding discrete tax items in the current and prior year. Through the third quarter, we\u2019ve returned $1.9 billion to shareholders and completed our $1 billion 2019 share repurchase target. Today, we announced an additional $250 million of share repurchases that we will target to complete in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 4, third quarter gross margin was down 90 basis points and EBIT margin was down 80 basis points. EBIT margin was up 50 basis points excluding the Aventics, Tools & Test and GE Intelligent Platforms acquisitions. Tax rate in both years benefited from several favorable discrete items in the quarter. Turning to Slide 5, third quarter underlying sales growth was led by Asia, Middle East and Africa, which accelerated from flat in Q2 to up 3% in Q3, primarily driven by sequential improvement in the Commercial & Residential Solutions business. However, the Automation Solutions business also ticked up sequentially. The Americas was up 1% and remained positive across both businesses but with slower compared to the second quarter growth of 7%. Europe was up 1% and remained positive across both platforms. Turning now to Slide 6, total segment margin was down 160 basis points and was down 30 basis points excluding recent acquisitions. Segment margin of 18.1% was approximately in line with our expectations as our business is executed well to deliver strong profitability on lower sales growth. We guided sequential core leverage in the mid-40s and our businesses together delivered over 70% on $120 million higher sales. As we discussed last year, we\u2019ve accelerated certain restructuring programs in the second half of 2019 to position the business for a slower near-term growth environment. In Q2, we identified approximately $10 million of restructuring investments to accelerate in this fiscal year. And this quarter, we\u2019ve added another $20 million. Our total expected restructuring spend and other actions is now $100 million for 2019, which is up from approximately $70 million at our February Investor Conference. These investments will help position the company for improving profitability in early 2020. Operating cash flow performance with solid, up 2% and free cash flow was \u2013 conversion was 135% in the quarter. Our year-to-date free cash flow conversion is 88% and we continue to expect strong cash flow performance in the fourth quarter and greater than 100% full year cash flow conversion. Trade working capital is an opportunity for us in the fourth quarter. TWC performance was worse by 80 basis points driven entirely by inventory, which was higher in June, as sales soften late in the quarter. We expect to recover this in the fourth quarter, which will benefit cash performance. Turning onto Slide 7, Automation Solutions\u2019 underlying sales were up 3% and orders were up 4% in the quarter. Underlying sales trend in the quarter remained broadly stable as follows. We saw continued strong demand across our three kinds of business; MRO spending, brownfield, and greenfield projects. All world areas remained positive. And we continue to see healthy progress in our long cycle project outlook, a strong project funnel, systems orders growth, and a growing backlog. There were few areas that missed our expectations. First, North America upstream oil and gas did not recover as we expected. Customers in the Permian and other key regions continue to focus their CapEx budgets and maximize free cash flow, also limited pipeline capacity continued to constrain investment activity. Second, global discrete manufacturing end markets decelerated. The short cycle weakness was particularly sales in automotive and semiconductor end markets. And finally, although our project funnel remains healthy, our customers are more cautious around capital spending. Geopolitical and trade tensions have created a more cautious investment \u2013 business investment climate. As a result, we\u2019ve seen some projects push out of the year. This has impacted our orders and sales growth expectations in 2019. However, we\u2019ve not had any project cancellations and we continue to have confidence that projects in the funnel will be executed. For the full year, we expect underlying sales growth of approximately 5%, which is at the low end of our prior guidance. This implies a fourth quarter underlying sales growth rates of approximately 5% a bit stronger than Q3, which is supported by steady orders growth and backlog conversion. Segment margin decreased 150 basis points and was down 10 basis points excluding the Aventics and GE Intelligent Platforms acquisitions. The business delivered sequential leverage above our guidance as the management team executed well on lower growth. As mentioned, we have pulled in additional restructuring actions that we are targeting and complete this year. Including the full year segment margin is expected to be approximately 15%. Turning to Slide 8, Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales and orders were down 1% in the quarter. Growth in the Americas decelerated from 4% in Q2 to 1% this quarter, due mainly to unfavorable weather conditions, cooler, wet weather in key regions late in the quarter that\u2019s flowed residential, air conditioning and construction markets. Europe also decelerated late in the quarter due to weather, but preliminary July orders trended positively. The Asia, Middle East and Africa region improved from down 15% in Q2 to down 6% this quarter. And we expect improvement to continue with underlying sales growth turning positive as we head into 2020. And the preliminary trailing three months underlying orders in July were up slightly a good sign. For the full year, we expect Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying growth to be approximately flat compared to up 2% in our prior guidance. This implies a slightly positive Q4 growth rate, which is supported by expected improvement in North America air conditioning markets and continued improvement in Asia, Middle East and Africa region. Margin decreased 70 basis points excluding the Tools & Test acquisition. The businesses delivered over 40%, I\u2019m sorry, the business delivered over 40% sequential leverage on incremental sales, which was in line with our guidance. We expect full year segment margins to be approximately 21% including additional restructuring actions pulled into the fourth quarter. Let\u2019s turn now to Slide 9. Our 2019 guidance framework is updated to reflect underlying sales growth of approximately 3%, including lower than expected third quarter growth in a reduced near-term growth outlook for global discrete markets. Fourth quarter underlying growth is expected to be approximately 3.5%. The EPS guidance range is maintained at $3360 to $3.70 and we expect fourth quarter earnings per share of approximately $1.10, which is the midpoint of the full year range. Updated full year segment margin targets reflect reduced growth and increased restructuring spend. The fourth quarter total reported segment leverage is expected to be approximately 30% year-over-year and almost 40% sequentially, compared with the third quarter. Reduced segment profit contribution is offset by lower corporate costs and a lower full year tax rate to hold the prior 2019 EPS guidance range. We expect fourth quarter corporate cost to be approximately $150 million. The fourth quarter tax rate is expected to be approximately 21%, including a $0.05 discrete tax benefits. And the 2019 full year tax rate is also expected to be approximately 21%. We\u2019ve updated our estimated ongoing operational tax rate, which includes improvements from platform reorganization actions. We now expect our operational tax rate to be approximately 23.5% going forward, as we continue to optimize our global two-platform operating structure. Expected operating cash flow is $3.1 billion and free cash flow is unchanged at $2.5 billion. Please turn now to Slide 10, and I will hand the call over to Mr. David Farr. David Farr : Thank you very much, Tim. I want to welcome everybody. Thanks for joining us. I\u2019d say also want to let you know that, this is Tim\u2019s next as last earnings call. I go through this process of training semi-professional Investor Relations people. Tim Reeves : They never get there. David Farr : They never quite get there. But Tim has a unique opportunity that we can\u2019t talk about, but he\u2019s going to be going to it later this year. And I have breaking in another person, by the time, we get into the November timeframe. But Tim most likely will join us for that call. And I want to thank everybody for joining us today and I want to give you an update and what we see. I want to thank the employees for joining us today. Also want to remind everybody, we actually have an extensive number of people in the queue close to 20 people in the queue to ask questions. So I definitely need to keep you to holding to the two questions rules, we\u2019ll extend the call a little bit maybe a minute or hour, 15:20 to try to get as many questions as possible. Clearly, as you can tell from my communications that we put out our communications we put out last Monday and the communications today, I have sensed and continuous sense of change in the underlying business environment, which I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be talking about here for a few minutes. And then you\u2019ll be asking a lot of questions around it. I also want to thank all the employees for their support over the last three months in this challenging third quarter we just went through and for the year-to-date numbers and as we drive to finish out this fiscal year in 2019 and moving into 2020. As I look at the year, it\u2019s a good year. We have good growth in sales, we have good growth in earnings, we have good growth in cash flow, but it\u2019s happened on folded much differently than we thought going back 9 months or 10 months ago. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re having to deal with right now. But as you can see in the orders chart on Page 10, two things. First, we have new pop called Doon, after Doon bag, one of our favorite golf places in Ireland and Doon is a black and tan. Next to rocket, rocket birthday, today is one-year old, birthday is today. You can see the order trend did improve slightly for automation solutions. It ticked up a little bit, pulled us up a little bit. On the Commercial & Residential Solutions for the month of July, orders were a little bit better, but still slightly negative overall in a specific turn positive and ends \u2013 the month of July, which is good. We\u2019re now three or four months behind what we said, more or like four months behind what we said, but it\u2019s good to see that happening. You could see the industries we see \u2013 we\u2019ve been seeing pretty good strength in the third quarter, between the midstream, downstream, lots of caution around the upstream area right now. Chemical, we\u2019ve got a very good quarter and power our orders in the PWS power business is, it close to 40% up for the quarter around the world as we continue to upgrade the power facilities around the world. Automotive and semiconductor and discrete really had a tough quarter. But overall, a softening in key marketplaces, but the trend lines are still positive over, but definitely slowed to way below we thought when we started this year. Go forward, we\u2019ve updated the \u2013 what we call our large project pipeline funnel, Including, we actually did an upgraded the total size of the funnel, when we give this funnel out two, three times a year. In February, it was around $7.6 billion, 195 projects, today it\u2019s 221 projects, $8.3 billion, it did increase a little bit. Clearly, another sign of things slowing down a little bit of push out is that are committed one, but not booked is now slightly over $1 billion in projects. Projects that are basically sitting out there that we\u2019ve won an there, we\u2019re still waiting for the final documentation in order to be placed. So we can start booking and then obviously, start doing some shipments against it. The other key thing you\u2019ll see in this is that, on down the bottom, we talk about what\u2019s been shifted out of 2019 and 2020, based on what we\u2019ve seen about $350 million of projects we\u2019re working on for the last couple of \u2013 6 to 8, 12 months has been shifted from 2019 to 2020 and we basically have seen about $450 million, other pipeline shifted out of 2020 into 2021. Clearly, this tells you we have, what I call, a dynamic pipe and some things moving in, some things moving out, but clearly a slow down. I fundamentally believe in discussions with our customer base, our organization around the world, we\u2019ve been spending a lot of time on this last couple of months is, this cycle is not ended. This cycle is in a pause mode, because of the disruption that\u2019s going on relative to the trade negotiations, the trade discussions and it\u2019s clearly causing a slowdown in some key markets, primarily the USA, a little bit of Europe and we\u2019ve seen some pushback in a couple of places around the world. But our international markets have continued to held up from an automation standpoint, U.S. markets pushed out a little bit. The Canada market pushed out a little bit and a little bit of push out and actually sales are going out in the Middle East, but overall, still going in. And I firmly believe, if we do get resolution to, trade discussions at some point in time here between now and the next 12, 18 months. The cycle will move back up. There\u2019s not been an excessive amount of capital spent and build out in the cycle yet. It\u2019s way too early. I just look at what\u2019s going on inside our company as we reallocate. But I\u2019m sure, we\u2019ll have a lot of questions around this issue. As I look at what\u2019s going on, I am a little concerned from the standpoint of how long the slowdown will happen. Hence, the OCE got together over the last 30 days and looked at some incremental restructuring. We\u2019ve looked at where we need to slow down investments, where we need to pullback investments. We\u2019ve looked at where we can accelerate restructuring that we had planned in 2021 and to deal with protecting and improving our profitability in a slower growth environment. Clearly, we laid in a structure of costs from people standpoint organization back in 2018 and the end of 2018 running through 2019, look at much faster growth. This year, for instance, we had thought we\u2019d grow around the 6% to 6.5%, we\u2019re now growing around that 3% to 3.5% range. You look at what we see going next year. I look at a very gradual growth environment at this point in time, but I also want to build in the flexibility if that doesn\u2019t happen that we could still protect our profitability and our cash flow and deliver some results for our shareholders. At this point in time, I see the slow down lasting well into 2020. And so I see some resolution on around what\u2019s going to happen with the trade discussions that we all face. And from my perspective, that could last easily well past the election at the November of 2020. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at it. It is a different perspective than I did discuss, say, electrical products group in May and even when the phone call in early May, but I\u2019ve come to the realization and watching our customer base and talking to our customer base is they\u2019re going to be cautious. And therefore from my perspective, we\u2019re going to continue to invest strategically, where we can gain market share or market penetration. And then we\u2019re going to back down and protect our profitability and cash flow where necessary. We\u2019re also going through a whole prioritization on our capital projects. From this year, we\u2019ve pulled it back a little bit as we go through this process. Next year, we\u2019re prioritizing where we need to spend capital. I have commitments that we have to do in capital over the next couple years. And I\u2019m trying to set with Frank and you\u2019ll see, those priorities of where we need to spend money. I have some actions, I have to take some additional manufacturing capacity in the best cost locations that we have around the world. But I need to prioritize those to make sure we\u2019re dealing the right way as we go forward here in 2020 and as we come back into 2021. Again, we\u2019re being proactive, we\u2019re trying to be a little bit more aggressive and hence our restructuring and we\u2019ll be looking at that pretty hard between now and year end. And if we see we have other opportunities, we will take those opportunities on. It\u2019s all about getting our cost structure in line for slower growth, improve our profitability, deliver the incremental margins that we\u2019ve been committing in a different growth environment and also positioning ourselves for one of recovery does happen in our capital base, which I believe will happen. So overall, again, I want to say it\u2019s been a good year from my perspective, it\u2019s not happened like we thought would happen. We totally happy about it. No. We\u2019ve been dealt a hand in a little bit more challenging environment relative to trade and relative to the investment environment. My customer base is being cautious, but we\u2019re not rolling up the tent and going home. We\u2019re going to be attacking and aggressive going after things. But we\u2019re also bringing our cost structure line to be able to serve ourselves and also serve our customers and also build the profitability that we want to deal with. So I want to thank everybody from the Emerson team as we wrap up this year. We\u2019ve got a couple more months left. And I want to thank the team as we get ready for 2020 and 2021. With that, we\u2019ll open the line, again I want to remind everybody we have a lot of people in line close to 20 or maybe more than 20 people now. And so I need to hold you the two questions and we\u2019ll take as much time up to about an hour, 15:20 to get through the questions. So with that, Tim, let\u2019s open it up. Tim Reeves : Okay. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good afternoon, guys. David Farr : Good afternoon, Andrew. Andrew Kaplowitz : This \u2013 so how do we think about the longer-term roadmap for you guys in the more difficult macro and particularly as we go into Slide 20, it might be difficult obviously to achieve the target in 2021 of $450 m. But if we are in this longer prolonged slowdown, can you still grow double-digits in EPS off the 2019 base. If not, that stabilize a bit here given a high level of restructuring and repurchases, how should we think about that? David Farr : From the perspective, our underlying growth rate based on the model we presented in February, it was close to 5%, $4.5% to 5%, I believe the cycle here. If that number is going to be closer to 2% to 3% because of the slowdown, we\u2019re going to have to have bolt \u2013 more bolt-on acquisitions to allow us to be able to get that tougher earnings growth. It\u2019ll be very \u2013 it\u2019ll be challenging for us. But that the key issue for me is, can we drive to make amount of roll through penetration, if that\u2019s possible and we\u2019ll try to do that while also going to have to be a little aggressive on the bolt-on acquisitions that allow us to integrate some more sales and profits to get that number up. But that\u2019s the game plan is going to have to be is where do we get that top line growth. If we lose about a point or two from underlying from this core business, then the acquisition games can be even more important to us on the \u2013 from the bolt-on standpoint. And then we\u2019re going to have to be aggressive on the integrating those acquisitions. That will be the key issue for us is as we look in the next couple of years and that target we laid out in February because of, as you said, it\u2019s a much different macro environment. Let something happen relative the trade early on in 2020, we spend what accelerate growth potentially in 2021 that would be another scenario, but I\u2019m not banking on that right now. We\u2019re looking at an environment that\u2019s going to be a little bit less growth in rapid deal with that. Andrew Kaplowitz : Yes, that\u2019s helpful. And then obviously, in Automation Solutions, you\u2019ve talked about 30% incremental as the target. How should we think about underlying instrumentals? If we do have this slower growth environment, given all the restructuring you\u2019re doing, could we still do 30% plus on lower growth? David Farr : That\u2019s the game plan. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going after the incremental restructuring now Andrew. We\u2019ve made a commitment to get that profit margin back up. These are quality assets. We\u2019ve made a lot of acquisitions within this asset space and we need to make sure from our shareholders standpoint that we get those margins back up to eyesight are that reasonable range. It might take us a little longer to get back to that what I think the appropriate number is now in this combination of companies that run 19% even, but we\u2019re not backing off that number incrementally, that\u2019s our number for next year and Lal and his team understand that. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re going after from a restructuring standpoint, from the perspective of what we\u2019re trying to get done. And if we need to, we\u2019ll do it more incremental restructuring in early part of 2020. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks, Dave. Appreciate it. David Farr : All the best, Andrew. Thank you. Operator : Our next question today will come from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Hey guys, good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon, Steve. Steve Tusa : Congrats to Tim, unless you\u2019re like sending them to some God for sake in part of the world like, I don\u2019t know where you send these people, but hopefully its going more nice. David Farr : Tusa, I can willing to \u2013 I\u2019m open for suggestions. I mean you might have to talk to his wife a little bit about this. She is the St. Louis girl. But you might \u2013 if you got an idea, it\u2019s not going to be gut to Georgia. I can tell you that right now. Steve Tusa : No. I\u2019m just going to say that you stole that one. I\u2019m just going to say that. David Farr : Not going to be a gut to Georgia. Most likely, it could be like, so what the tough place in Nevada? We get some get valley or something like this. Now he is going to be going most likely in the Northeast somewhere. Steve Tusa : Got it, got it. I love the red exclamation points on the order trends. I think that, that really pops stands out. But how bad was kind of your discrete business on order rate or revenues either one like are those down double-digit. And then as a follow-up to that, within power specifically and then a little bit less in LNG, how do you think you\u2019re doing share wise, because power, I would assume that\u2019s more kind of attacking competitor installed base and selling digital and that kind of stuff. So it seems like there\u2019s a bit of a share gain there in power. David Farr : So on the discrete side, we\u2019re not down double-digit. I mean it\u2019s a solid single-digit, but\u2026 Steve Tusa : Okay. David Farr : I mean I would say, Tim and I are going back for the somewhere between 5% to 8% mid-single digit down in the discrete side. The inventory has not come out of the system at all. Obviously, the demand slowed down as you\u2019ve seen Steve, and therefore it\u2019s going to take a little longer. It could last all the way to the calendar year now to get that out. But that\u2019s where we see at that point in time. The process side where it\u2019s been pretty good within the channel, but just right now its oil and gas related down around Texas and the Permian has been pretty tough. On the power side, we are very committed to this space. And we\u2019ve continued to bring out the next generation control system ovation. We continued to bring out new services. We\u2019ve continued to be highly committed to supporting the power generation both renewable, primary power, all different types of power, particularly around colder gas. So based on what we\u2019re seeing right now, I would say we are winning against our key competitors out there. But obviously, we\u2019re not going to back down. I think there\u2019s a unique window of opportunity as we look at this. And overall this year, year-to-date, we\u2019re up a solid single-digit in orders. And I think we\u2019re going to have a good fourth quarter and good start to next year. The industry needs to go through some reinvestments and upgrading systems, taking old systems down and bringing out the new power plants, bringing up new gas, get rid of coal. These are all opportunities for us and we\u2019re out there fighting for it. And I would say we\u2019re doing pretty well at this point in time. And again, I don\u2019t look at a quarter per share. I mean, let\u2019s wrap it up as we finished this calendar year, but I feel good at the trend line as I look at the last 12 months to 18 months versus our primary competitors in the space. Steve Tusa : Right. But that\u2019s the OEM installed base, correct, that you\u2019re going after? David Farr : Correct. Steve Tusa : Yes. And then one last one just on the macro, you seemed confident that this isn\u2019t getting worse, but then you said things extend, I mean, through the election next year. I mean how are your customers and you guys going to not at least pause a little bit before all the uncertainty around the election and let you just have, I\u2019m sure you have confidence in the outcome, but like how are you going to integrate that into your kind of plans and your thinking? David Farr : From our perspective, we\u2019re going to work multiple plans here from my perspective. I think we\u2019re going to look at an environment where there\u2019s very little growth in environment. There\u2019s some moderate growth. Clearly, we still see our international business doing better than the U.S. at this point in time. And that\u2019s going to allow us to see a little bit better growth. But we\u2019re going to factor in that. We could be in a slugfest with real low-single digit growth for the next 12 months and therefore you got to get that cost line in line and really prioritize we\u2019re going to spend money. It\u2019s not going to be \u2013 in my opinion, I\u2019m being very, very, let\u2019s say cautious or negative, but I\u2019m very concerned about business was like you said, keep pausing and they keep reevaluating their investment and that\u2019s going to drag the business investment to a weaker environment. If it doesn\u2019t happen that way and things get better, we\u2019ll be okay. But I\u2019m more worried about that it will happen and they\u2019re fine, we\u2019re structuring the company to be in that environment. Steve Tusa : Got it, okay. Thanks a lot. Tim Reeves : Thank you. David Farr : Thanks, Steve. All the best. If you\u2019ve got ideas, we\u2019re going to send Tim, send him to me. Operator : Our next question today will come from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. David Farr : Good afternoon, Jeff. How are you doing? Jeff Sprague : I\u2019m doing well. Thank you. Fighting through it all so. David Farr : Good. It\u2019s always fun at slugfest system. You get to meet, he gets boring. Jeff Sprague : No, exactly. Well, hey, I want to just to pick up on your last point. You\u2019re \u2013 you kind of indicated you didn\u2019t use the term, but maybe kind of the risk of just stall speed. And if we get there, what really kind of keeps us from kind of tip in lower. I guess no one has a crystal ball, right. But how would you handicap kind of a worse outlook than what you portrayed in your opening comments there? David Farr : The key issue there is, I think there\u2019s a good chance of economy, next year it gets the global economy gets real close to that stall speed. And I think that, as we finished the rest of this calendar year, which I think will be okay relative to investment then people then really start reevaluating in 2020. We have to \u2013 if we sense we\u2019re going to get pretty close that stall speed which we\u2019ve seen the economy before, then we got to think about, okay, do we have the right things done relative to our restructuring and our position the company. Right now I mean I think we\u2019re going to get close to that stall speed, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to go all that way. We also, as you understand around the world, we have the every Fed \u2013 Federal Reserve around the world really pushing accommodation to make sure the economies do not get to that stall speed. So I think that\u2019s one thing we have gone for us. That the European, the Japanese, the Chinese, the American, Federal Reserve banks where they\u2019re called around the world are working very, very hard to make sure we don\u2019t go into that stall speed. But I think there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll get real close to it. And hopefully the financial reserves out there can figure out how to make sure we don\u2019t go in there, because that\u2019s a little bit different environment and it gets pretty ugly for a lot of companies at that point in time. Jeff Sprague : Yes. And then just separately, just thinking about the automation margins, right, so it actually ended up being kind of peculiar looking quarter, right. Your actual OP dollars are down, right. So we\u2019re not just talking mixed effects of deals on margins, but OP dollars down. So now as we look into Q4, right, we need to see a pretty significant step up in the OP dollars to get to that forecast. You had talked on the last call about some of the sweet things on price cost and other levers. Could you just give us a little bit more visibility on how we bridge to that Q4 automation margin number? David Farr : Yes. I think there\u2019s a couple of things going on from the perspective we have, obviously the price cost continues to move our way in that fourth quarter in a positive way. They did have a pretty good sequential margins improvement in the third quarter. The other thing is the restructuring actions that we took back a couple months ago. I believe in April and April, May and also some of the core restructuring that we started in the beginning of year, our start up flow through. So the automation business is things slowed down. As you remember, we started taking actions earlier on with that business, so some of those benefits are coming true. In the last couple months close and even June, which was a tough month for Automation Solutions from a sales standpoint, they did very well with leverage and in profitability. The month of July, which we\u2019re starting to see right now the same things flowing through again. So my gut tells me right now, I feel pretty good about where they flow. The key issue there is do they \u2013 can they continue to get some of that the backlog out that\u2019s been built over the year and/or do the customer start pushing that out. But right now I think they\u2019ve got the cost structure in line for where they sit in for this calendar year. Jeff, and I feel pretty good about the margins in the fourth quarter for these guys. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks, Dave. I\u2019ll pass it. David Farr : All the best to Jeff. Thank you very much. Have a good rest on that. Operator : The next question will come from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. David Farr : Good afternoon, Deane. Deane Dray : Hey, may be a good place to start, Dave would be the game plan where you would augment slowing growth with bolt-on acquisitions. And when I hear you say that, it kind of suggests that there\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019re still willing to play offense here and which is a good sign. But just how do you do you marry the idea of going after acquisitions during a period of high uncertainty and clearly a pause and closer to stall speed. David Farr : From the perspective of some of the bolt-on acquisitions, which we worked pretty aggressively all the time, fundamentally we believe as we go into this time period, as we move into 2020, early 2021. Some of the companies that we\u2019re interested in, we\u2019ll want to \u2013 we\u2019ll got \u2013 we\u2019ll want to get out and we\u2019ll have the opportunity to do those bolt-on acquisitions. Historically and times that things like this slowdown, things that gets kind of sloppy, near that sloppy, we see some of these product lines pop out. And so, we\u2019re bank yet, we\u2019re going to try and push the pressure point up on this thing. And see if we can get a couple of these pop and give us some incremental growth, the top line. Obviously work on the cash flow and obviously work with the earnings, but it\u2019s just going to be one of these gains that we know where we\u2019re going to go and we\u2019re nowhere pushing right now and does our \u2013 the place we\u2019re going to, are they willing to now to sell because of the sloppiness in the marketplace from their perspective. So that\u2019s how the game is going to work. What is put a little bit more tension on it and from the top level down and I know every company is going to be going through a repositioning, restructuring and hopefully, we\u2019ll be able to convince them of our sellers. They\u2019ll let a couple of these small product lines grow. That\u2019s how it\u2019s going to work. Deane Dray : Got it. And then as a follow-up, but just to continue along the lines of this pause versus an end of a cycle, can you comment on the power or the influence of this negative feedback loop, because you\u2019re saying right now you\u2019re slowing down your investments, you\u2019re pulling back, you\u2019re seeing customers push out projects. How does that not feed on itself and become a more of a power slower, faster? And to a certain extent, can you share with us how much you\u2019re seeing from your customer and being influenced by what your customers are doing versus what you are hearing from Washington, because you are privy to a lot more specifics than anyone on this phone gets to hear. But maybe share with us some of that, that insight that you\u2019re getting from those channels. David Farr : So a lot of projects we see in particular on the LNG world, from the perspective of these LNG investments need to go forward. There\u2019s been major commitments made from a lot of our customer base relative to around gas versus coal versus oil. From the standpoint of what we call less carbon, the carbon \u2013 they\u2019d been commitment. So from my perspective, these projects are going to go, they just a matter of what time they\u2019re going to go and when things get resolved. And I firmly believe we will get things resolved relative to discussions to China. It could take a lot longer than my initial comments were always around August, September time period and now that\u2019s obviously off the table based on what we\u2019re seeing at this point in time. And so I firmly look at the projects, the under investment in the gas side, leaving the under investment in the liquids and some of the under investments in some of the downstream work that needs to be done because we definitely need that downstream product. I see that those have to go forward. The question is when they get my customer base or our customer base gets visibility relative to where they can do these transactions and where they can sell and not sell, and you\u2019ll see these projects gone. Now, the other issue is if the projects in United States stall, then you\u2019ll start seeing some acceleration in projects in the Middle East, because of the demand for gas. China\u2019s still going to grow. China is going to need gas or they\u2019re going to get it from the Middle East. They\u2019re going to get it from other parts of the world or they\u2019re going to get it from the United States. So as I look at right now, as I look out the next 12 months, I think as a customer base, we\u2019re all fine tuning a little bit. But if this thing dragged on for a long time, and let\u2019s say the long time being 12 months to 18 months, then I think you start seeing what you talked about this that self fulfilling prophecy. And then we start whining backwards. But I think it\u2019s way too early to see that at this point in time. And maybe from my perspective things do get resolved sooner than we think. But at this point in time, it\u2019s prudent for me from the perspective where I\u2019m in the \u2013 we, Emerson on the pipeline, we need to dial things back after three quarters of very moderate growth in the automation business. We need to dial back and reset for a little bit growth in different of growth environment and look and see what happens rather than waiting, because we\u2019ve been waiting now for a couple of quarters and now it\u2019s time to ask. That\u2019s where we sit. I\u2019m still, again, I\u2019ll say it, I\u2019m still optimistic. I still believe that the world needs it the energy, they need this type of products. The question is the timing of it more than anything else at this point in time. Deane Dray : And can you add anything about the color from Washington? David Farr : Yes. Right now nothing at all. I can\u2019t add anything other than what\u2019s going on is obviously very challenging negotiations and a lot of pushing back and forth. Again, I still believe this is something that\u2019s important and I do support it. It creates a lot of pain for me, and obviously for our company. But from my perspective, it\u2019s \u2013 I do support 100% of what we\u2019re trying to get done in Washington on the long-term trade benefits. But we\u2019ve got to get this thing done. We can\u2019t let this thing sit out there for another 12 months, 18 months dragging around, because it will definitely do what you talked about with some negative self fulfilling prophecies. Deane Dray : Thank you. David Farr : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question today will come from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good afternoon, guys. David Farr : Good afternoon, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Dave, can you talk a little bit about this ballooning funnel of projects or I guess stuff that has been committed but not booked. How long do those typically stay out in that state? Is there any kind of leakage in that closed process where it\u2019s something where you think there\u2019s a commitment, but until the ink dries, it tends to back down. So how confident are you in that booking over the next few months, quarters, whatever? David Farr : So if we look at the funnel where their funnel growing is growing right now, it\u2019s growing outside United States. So we\u2019re starting to see, we had not seen a lot of growth of the bigger projects outside the United States, primarily in North America driven large funnel project business. So we\u2019re now starting to see some of the international be at Asia, be at the Middle East, be in Latin America, where some of the larger projects are now starting to come into the funnel enhanced. That\u2019s why that funnel is getting a little bit bigger. Now going back to the one but not both situations, the big issue for us is, it is like product that\u2019s been \u2013 food has been picked and put in the shelf. There is a shelf life. And from my \u2013 historically when we see this grow like this, we have seen it before. Typically that shelf life, you\u2019re looking at 12 months to 18 months on these projects, these are massive projects. These are projects typically they are going to last three, four, five, six years. So if they get delayed, 6 months to 12 months, if not unusual. From my perspective, if you get out there past the 12 months, 14 months, 16 months and these things really start changing and nothing happens, then you\u2019re going to see so reconfigure. It\u2019s way too early to say that, because this number until recently it was pretty normal. And now with this number getting up or more $1.1 billion, close to $1.1 billion, it\u2019s starting to get to a number that\u2019s got my attention. And so I think the key issue for me is watch them and see what these customers start doing. These are a lot of gas projects and a lot of U.S.-based projects at this point in time. And so I think we got to watch it is nothing that don\u2019t get overreact to, but it \u2013 from my perspective, these things sit out there for 12 months, 14 months, 16 months, then you\u2019re going to start seeing a reevaluation of what\u2019s the magnitude of this project do we want to downsize it. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. So it sounds like we need to stay on top of that as a number to talk about. And then just looking at the projects that have shifted out of the pipeline, and I know that there\u2019s difference between orders and sales, but if I think about that $350 million shifting from 2019 to 2020 and the $450 million to 2021. You were already kind of losing maybe a point or two of sales as it pertains to that. You talked about kind of a two or three-point downshift. It seems like on the shorter cycle into that or some of the projects that are in this pipeline that, that doesn\u2019t assume a very a whole lot more downside. Does that just speak to no excess in the system or the absence of destocking or I guess why couldn\u2019t we decelerate more given that the project piece already speaks to maybe half of the deceleration you\u2019ve talked about? David Farr : Yes. I think it\u2019s hard to measure on a couple of months on projects moving in and out, because they move a lot. Historically, we never gave that number and there was always a lot of moving, anyway, there\u2019s always a couple of hundred million dollar projects moving around. So I would say the number is a little bit higher than normal. To be honest, Josh, but there was always a number that moved in and out of a couple of hundred million dollar. So now \u2013 so I think I would definitely say the movement higher than normal. So therefore I would say does adds taken about a 1, 1.5 off the underlying growth rate of the cycle right now. And that\u2019s the number we\u2019re going to watch and see if there\u2019s been a bigger movement from the next time we talk as we close out this calendar year that\u2019d be a good feel for it. I think you got to wait till the end of the calendar year if you get a good feel. But right now there\u2019s always noise and I would say it is about a point that\u2019s been taken off the underlying growth. And it\u2019s moved up a tad, but I wouldn\u2019t panic, yes, because there\u2019s always that number sitting in there. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That\u2019s good perspective. Thanks, Dave. David Farr : Okay, good. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks. Good afternoon, Dave. David Farr : Good afternoon, Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : So I just want to start with Commercial & Residential. So you guys have kind of guided for flat organic growth for the year. It implies a little bit above flat, maybe like 1% in the fourth quarter. And that\u2019s a step up. Now I know you saw a little bit of improvement in July, which is encouraging. But I guess how much confidence do you have in that outcome and could there still be some risk to the downside there, particularly since the comp \u2013 beyond your comp does get a little bit harder in the fourth quarter. David Farr : Yes. Definitely it gets harder because of our U.S. base last year. So there are a couple of things that we\u2019re watching very closely. One that the fact that China now and Asia-Pacific now has stabilized and come above the line that\u2019s a good sign for us. So my concern would not be there. My concern would be in the USA. If all of a sudden, this \u2013 we\u2019ve had a pretty good, what I would call heat wave, humidity wave go through, that would be my concern right now. Not in the AC side, but more on the retail side. But we\u2019ve got it pretty, pretty well dialed down. I feel pretty comfortable about that. Europe seems to be coming back. Europe had a very challenging June, because it\u2019s extremely hot there, but it\u2019s bounced back nicely in July. So I feel pretty good that we\u2019re going to be around the 0% to 1% growth rate in Bob\u2019s business in the fourth \u2013 our fourth quarter, which is the third fiscal or third calendar quarter. I think we\u2019ve got a doubt pretty close to where we see it right now. And the fact that July came in decently and the orders came in decently. Even I think that was the one month order pace positive, the one month order pace was positive. So its positive real close to that 1% I think. And so I think we\u2019re okay there, but we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ll people \u2013 we\u2019ll put our 8-K at orders and we\u2019ll keep a communication around those three things, Asia, China and North America and as you\u2019re keep holding in there for us. So those are the three things I\u2019m watching right now in Commercial and Res. Nicole DeBlase : Okay, got it. Thanks, Dave. And then just on Automation Solutions, you talked about things getting a little bit better in July. I mean, maybe it\u2019s my eyesight, but the charges doesn\u2019t show a lot of improvement. If you could just talk a little bit more about the early stages of July and then what\u2019s driving that better result. David Farr : I tell you what, after a tough June, if it goes ticks up a notch, it\u2019s better. And so I think what we were underlying with what 4.5% goes last quarter. Tim Reeves : Right, 4, yes. David Farr : 4, so it picked up a little bit. You can\u2019t see that in a chart, because I probably had younger eyes, Nicole, come on. So it\u2019s a little bit better. What\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s not the U.S. We saw Asia, we saw China as probably the ones that something about China that\u2019s interesting. We saw a pretty good impact in China. We saw a good impact in Latin America. So our international markets actually grew order wise, I think double-digit. And in North America, the U.S. business \u2013 Canadian business was still the weakness point. So our international held up nicely. And therefore that right now we see that holding up for the year. That will give us a little bit of momentum as we go into this. And I think we\u2019re going to bounce somewhere between 4% to 5% in this \u2013 in orders in this fourth quarter. So and July was not a short month, I think it was a fairly long month for us normally. And this month, and so it\u2019s a good representation of what \u2013 I think, what\u2019s going on in the marketplace. So I feel reasonably well about that 4.5% now. Given the fact, I thought we\u2019d be at 6% or 7%. I don\u2019t feel that exciting, but it\u2019s better than going to the other way, let\u2019s put that. Nicole DeBlase : Definitely. Thanks, Dave. David Farr : Thank you very much, Nicole. See you soon. Operator : And our next question will come from John Inch of Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead. John Inch : Afternoon, Dave. David Farr : Good afternoon, John. John Inch : Afternoon. So hey, the \u2013 I wonder if you could comment on the profitability of the large project pipeline. Is it accretive to the 16% AS margin run rate here? David Farr : Typically large project will be 10% lower than that. And so what we do obviously a hybrid. Now you\u2019re talking about large. Now if you look at the, what I would call the smaller circles in there, the medium and small sized circles those typically are \u2013 those are accretive to us. So it\u2019s a bigger ones that are typically will be the lower-double digit or 10 \u2013 tied 10 times number there. So right now given the fact that projects have slowed down, the bigger projects does help us a little bit. But I want to get those projects going, so we can get the installed base. But the mix of funnel right now, it looks pretty decent, because I look at that funnel, I mean if you look at that funnel we put out there, if you can see it. You can see there\u2019s a lot of small, medium size projects. The bigger projects, there\u2019s only one big project left in this year. And so that\u2019s a good mix. As I finish off the fourth quarter, going back to our comments on profitability and a good start for 2020. So based in that funnel that tells me I like the mix. John Inch : So these deferrals aren\u2019t necessarily putting incremental price pressure on kind of the bid quote, that sort of thing. It\u2019s just a pure deferral, right? David Farr : Yes, correct. Typically, if you have the chart in front of me, on Chart 11, if you look at the bigger bubbles, you probably even black or white, but I\u2019m looking at that big bubble sitting at the end of 2019. That\u2019s a fairly large project. That would typically be a price pressure type environment. When I look at the smaller, medium sized ones, typically those are going to be KOB2 \u2013 KOB2 type projects and typically those are projects you already have the install base. And therefore the profitability is going to be around that our margin or normal margin. John Inch : And then Dave, just as a follow-up, your comments around doing some more bolt-ons, here to maybe supplement some of the earnings. Can you remind us what percent of your sales are, say embedded software. What percent might be standalone software? And would you be looking to kind of software \u2013 industrial software types of companies as part of your frame for doing more bolt-ons? David Farr : Well, if you look at the acquisitions we\u2019ve done this year, a lot of them were software companies. And so the answer is, yes. So we\u2019re looking at \u2013 we did a lot of smaller \u2013 we\u2019re doing a lot of smaller deals this year and most of them have been tied around software, standalone software, embedded software. Again, that is a key issue for us. And we\u2019re trying to find the type of deals that we\u2019re doing for the [indiscernible] Tim Reeves : We should slide at our investor conference $400 million standalone software on the As side and that doesn\u2019t include the embedded piece. David Farr : It doesn\u2019t included. Yes. So we did $400 million. The standalone is about $400 million and then we have a lot of embedded, which we don\u2019t break out the systems business. But yes, if you look at the deals we\u2019re doing right now, there are lot less products, but they\u2019re more software based. And I think that\u2019s a common trend within this automation space as we drive into the control and drive it into the \u2013 to our customer base, around specific industries. Again, it\u2019s not a lot of them out there. So you have to quarter for a long time. And we\u2019ve done quite a few this year. They\u2019re smaller. And the acquisitions to me are important relative to gives us opportunities to add sales, profits and as Frank points out, operations have to deliver the earnings and as soon as you plan to make them creative, but that\u2019s going to be a key issue for us to drive, we can get top line organically. We\u2019ve got to get them through bolt-ons and they\u2019ve got to deliver the profit. John Inch : But it sounds like those deals would be more of the strategic nature, right, versus trying to find stuff that would supplement the earnings that\u2026 David Farr : Yes. Yes. Yes. When I talk about \u2013 okay, yes. Yes. Okay, I hope you\u2019ll take that. I\u2019m not talking about going out, I\u2019m talking about bolt-ons within our core business, within the core business of automation, within the core mix. I\u2019m not looking at going out and to do any type of acquisition to get sales, earnings and cash flow or EPS. Now these are within the core \u2013 clearly from my perspective, things really get slow, get to that stall speed. I think we\u2019re going to see opportunities for more of these smaller bolt-on deals coming forward. And we\u2019ve got to be very aggressive and going after them and figuring out how to integrate them pretty quickly to get little bit more growth in that 2021 time period, going back to the first question, somebody asked me early on, do we have a path to get the EPS closer to what we said back in February. Because the sales aren\u2019t going to be there right now, organically unless we have a big pop in 2021, so we\u2019re going to have to figure out how to \u2013 in bolt-on deals within our core space to that. John Inch : That\u2019s a good point. Thank you. And I sent him to Canada. David Farr : Calgary, Alberta, where\u2019s the worst mosquito problem. John Inch : I think, it\u2019s everywhere. Operator : Our next question today will come from John Walsh, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Walsh : Hi, good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon. John Walsh : I guess, maybe a first question around the hybrid markets. We\u2019ve heard a little bit of mixed commentary out of that market. Sounds like you\u2019re still doing very well there. Do you think it\u2019s because of your mix, because you\u2019re taking share just hybrid covers a couple of different end markets there maybe what we\u2019re seeing. David Farr : Yes, exactly. So from our perspective, our hybrid business clearly, we\u2019re pretty strong into the life science. And so we\u2019ve had a pretty good run in the life sciences. From the perspective, I\u2019m not \u2013 in that hybrid space, we don\u2019t have automotive, we don\u2019t have semiconductor, we have the life sciences, we have some food and beverages. We have some mining in that. And so that\u2019s been doing pretty good for us. The food and beverage has not been that strong for us, but it\u2019s primarily been the life sciences and the mining area that has been good for us relative to our hybrid business. John Walsh : Got you. And then maybe just as a follow on, I think in maybe to Jeff\u2019s question earlier around margin levers. I think you said, price cost will be positive again in the fiscal Q4, but how do you think about that kind of price cost balance, as you run it forward? David Farr : Right now, the key issue for us is, commodities have come down, excluding any additional aggressive tariff action other than the 10%, which is not primarily aimed at us, industry is more of a consumer care approach. I think, our price cost balance going into 2020 right now is pretty good. It\u2019s green. Now those things could change and those are the things we have to deal with. But last year at this time, you thought about tariffs were coming in, we had material still going up. People thought we\u2019re going to see faster growth. And so we are looking at a little bit different type of place in our environments. So this time, it\u2019s moving in the opposite way. And the key issue for us is to keep our costs in line and obviously make sure we have price discipline around the price cost. But right now as we look at the early stages of 2020, it\u2019s green and we feel good about it and should be okay as we start the year out. John Walsh : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. David Farr : All the best, John. Operator : Our next question will come from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Maybe a first question on Automation Solutions in China. You\u2019re coming up to the end of what\u2019s been a very good three year up turn. Historically, my guess this industry in China tends to have three or four year up turns and 18 month downturn. So just wondered how you\u2019re assessing the market outlook in China, in terms of that risk of turning down next year. And whether you\u2019d seen any more evidence of U.S. companies, perhaps being pushed down the priority list on orders, which is something I think you\u2019d mentioned back at EPG. David Farr : Yes. So on the cycle through this month, the cycle is still pretty good. We\u2019re looking at a very solid 8% to 10% Automation Solutions orders growth and sales growth. As I look at the industries, we\u2019re serving, there\u2019s a lot of industries that Chinese customer base is trying to become more self sufficient and so obviously less imports of final goods. So that\u2019s where they\u2019re aiming their investments. I do not see that changing as we move into 2020. As my initial look at 2020 right now for Asia or for China is, the 8% to 10% most likely is going to turn into, let\u2019s say, six to eight, maybe five to eight type of growth. So we\u2019re looking at a slower growth to your point, Julian. But I\u2019m not looking for that drop off yet, because they have not, they really haven\u2019t finished building out what they need to build out relative to the infrastructure. They\u2019re trying to become more self sufficient in the industries we serve. Relative to \u2013 what I called nationalistic tendencies for the Chinese relative to foreigners. It\u2019s not just U.S. companies, it\u2019s all companies. I mean, it could be European companies too. The trend has continued for the standpoint we\u2019ve seen some pressure points relative to some of our customers being pushed about, you need to look at alternative sources not just foreign companies sources via European or American. I think that trend will continue as long as trade discussions are underway. And hopefully, the trade discussions will be finalized before, the foreign companies are really pushed to a smaller piece of the marketplace. Right now, obviously, we\u2019re still okay, but it\u2019s something that we spend a lot of time. We have people going in and supporting our customer organization \u2013 our sales organization, our customer\u2019s organization. Lal Karsanbhai was just here, Mike is going in next week. And I\u2019ll be going in about within a less of the month. So we\u2019re spending a lot of time with our sales and with our customers. Because we\u2019re very concerned about the negative trends of nationalism and clearly it\u2019s something we\u2019re fighting. Right now, I haven\u2019t seen anything, I mean, there\u2019s a little bit more, but not astronomical more or we would not be growing as we\u2019re growing right now. Julian Mitchell : Very helpful, thanks. And then my quick follow-up would just be around your assessment of inventory levels among your channel partners and customers. How much destock do you think is needed across automation and CNRS? David Farr : It\u2019s still too high. Given the fact that \u2013 if look at Emerson\u2019s inventory, with the slower June, our inventory did not come down as it normally would in June. So we\u2019re a good indication of that. Julian, I mean \u2013 there\u2019s a balance sheet out there. So you could see, our inventory level did not drop like normal from quarter-to-quarter. And \u2013 from my perspective, as I look at the channel right now, I think \u2013 I thought the channel would be done by the end of this third calendar quarter. I think, we\u2019re going to be well into the fourth calendar quarter before that destocking is done. And we sense that, people are being very cautious and so I think, it\u2019s going to take a little longer. Because the demand is weaker, therefore the demand is not going to drive the destock and it\u2019s going to have to take it down very slowly. That\u2019s how it looks to me. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you. David Farr : All the best to you, Julian. Operator : And our next question today will come from Robert McCarthy of Stephens. Please go ahead. Robert McCarthy : Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for fitting me in. David Farr : Good afternoon, Robert. Clearly may the cut offline, I mean\u2026 Robert McCarthy : I guess, we\u2019ll see in Arkansas a little bit later in the month, right, in any event. The first question, Dave, obviously you\u2019ve been focused on niche and bolt-ons, particularly in discrete side and kind of make your number over the longer term. But the question remains in a down cycle, you might have opportunities to look at other larger properties. How do you think of the state of the balance sheet from your ability to do a larger deal absent the use of equity? What is your outer bound at this point? David Farr : From the perspective of deals we\u2019re looking at right now and we show the board, obviously, we made the decision to do a little bit more share repurchase. From the standpoint, our deals, our acquisitions this year, where it\u2019s not going to be as high there. First say the, first six months, we didn\u2019t see the pipeline being strong. So we\u2019ve made the decision to a little bit more share repurchase. Now, clearly we started this process before the stock get whacked in all the trade discussions, but if I look at our leverage point, we can do a $4 billion or $5 billion type of transaction and completely around that debt to EBITDA margin of up a little bit over that. So we have plenty of room and there\u2019s not a lot of $5 billion, $6 billion, $7 billion, $8 billion deals out there. So I think we could get through the key issue is, Frank knows, as we\u2019ve got to obviously dial back share repurchase a little bit. And then we had actually demonstrate to the rating agencies that we\u2019re going to get our ratios back now, which we have in the past. Frank Dellaquila : Yes. I mean, Rob, there\u2019s nothing that we can reasonably foresee that would cause us to contemplate issuing equity. We can do everything within the balance sheet that we can foresee. David Farr : The type of deals we see \u2013 the biggest type of level deal, we\u2019d see as a $4 billion, $5 billion. So we show the board that ratio as we go through this whole process of capital allocation, which we did last month, our last June \u2013 in June. And also we did today and we did in the finance committee this morning with Frank. And we are comfortably well within the brand of acquisitions we see an ability to continue to do pretty good level with the share repurchase and have the opportunity to do the deals if necessary. Robert McCarthy : Two smaller questions, if you\u2019ll forgive me. One, CapEx assumptions going forward, have we put a cap on that or a modest reduction on that given what you\u2019re seeing in the prevailing environment. And then number two, any sideways look at kind of the midstream and refiners intentions around IMO and whether they\u2019re going to look to build capacity for the low sulfur distillate or what is the intentions for spending there if you could share any. David Farr : Yes. Relative to capital, we\u2019ve scaled capital back this year. We\u2019ve asked, we\u2019ve had sessions here the last 60 days. So capital this year is going to be around $600 million. From the standpoint of next year, we have to take capital up. We have, as I\u2019ve said, I think in 8-K and also in the press release. We have some issues from our standpoint of \u2013 as we\u2019ve now had some on the acquisitions for two or three years. We are now doing the optimization of where we want to do some best cost manufacturing. So we have some investments that we need to make in 2020 getting ready for actions we want to take in 2021 and 2022. So from my perspective right now, our capital spending for the next couple of years are probably up around the 3.5%, 3.6% level, as we prepare for this move into this \u2013 sort of better manufacturing locations and then allows us to move as we go into 2021 and 2022. So, we\u2019re evaluating everything around the capital structure right now. Do we need to do it in 2020 or can we push it out. But I \u2013 if I look at the numbers right now, because of what we see the needed for 2021 and 2022, we will be taking capital back up in 2020 little bit higher than it as this year. And I think same thing will happen 2022. So we try to balance this. We spend money all the time, as you well know, but I\u2019m shaving it now and then we\u2019re going to have to put some money back in next year. Robert McCarthy : And then the on IMO real quick. David Farr : I don\u2019t have, I can\u2019t give you more insights. I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t talk in recently about that. I do know by look at the project investments on the refineries today and KOB2. It\u2019s still pretty high on the list of projects we\u2019re going after and projects we\u2019re winning. But I\u2019ve never \u2013 I can\u2019t give you a specific number to say, these guys, yes, they\u2019re going to keep doing it, they\u2019re going to take it up. But I can tell you right now, my folks that tell me the field refining bidding is still going on. So they appear to me moving forward and spending in the space. That\u2019s what I see at this point in time now. Will that be something they scale back if they really start scaling capital back later this year, as they move to 2020. But if I look at the project list right now, there\u2019s a lot of good refining type of projects out there. Robert McCarthy : Thanks for your time, David. David Farr : Okay. Take care. You\u2019re forgiven for ask them two and half questions. Operator : Our next question will come from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. David Farr : Hey, Joe. How you doing? I was trying to Rob, before you got off and tell me \u2013 you tell her \u2013 tell Hail Mary\u2019s couple of hours prayers. But Rob ran off to the church too quickly. Joe Ritchie : He\u2019s already doing them, Dave. David Farr : Yes. How you doing, Joe? Joe Ritchie : Doing great. Great. Thanks for fitting me in. So obviously, you look the backdrop is challenging or it\u2019s been a little bit more challenging than we all expected. I guess, at what point do you guys think about revisiting your longer term targets for 2021. I know, it\u2019s still ways away and lot can happen between now and then. But how are you thinking about that now just in light of the backdrop being a little bit more challenging? David Farr : As we told the board \u2013 we had a board meeting today as we told the board today, we\u2019ll, grind 2020 here for the next three months. And during that process, we\u2019ll grind 2021 at the same time, because of this very issue of \u2013 the things slowdown is a bump \u2013 could it be bump in 2021, as we grind what we hear from our customers as they finish their calendar year. So we\u2019re going to be going through a two year window here basically, because of that issue. Going back to question, it\u2019s just a pause and then acceleration or is this going to be a grind in stall speed and then things really slip away as we go into later 2020 into 2021. We\u2019ll be doing that here as we finish this year out. And then we have a very good view by the time we finished the calendar year 2020 or 2019. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to go at right now. I want to get a feel for my customers. Am I being too cautious or am I being realistic. And so we\u2019ll get a feel for it. Joe Ritchie : Yes. I mean it sounds like potentially maybe an update then by the Investor Day next year. David Farr : For sure. For sure. I will not lose \u2013 leave this calendar year without myself have an update and communicate my board. So I have a sense, because I do go out and talk and I want to make sure I\u2019m not looking at some crazy thing for 2021, that doesn\u2019t make sense. I got new Investor Relations guy and I can pin the other guy and blame him for all that crap and so, there works job, you\u2019ve see some Investor Relations guy. Never to be surface to get. It seems better good one, seems better good one, I have to tell you, he is a good guy. Joe Ritchie : If I could fit maybe one more in, I thought your comment\u2026 David Farr : You could fit one more in. Joe Ritchie : I thought your commentary Dave earlier on, seeing a slower like U.S. Gas/Canada Gas environment was interesting. I\u2019m just wondering like, do you think the trade environment is impacting off take agreements from happening with Asian partners and that\u2019s impacting LNG investment. Or what is it that you see that\u2019s kind of driving that slower gas investment here in the U.S. and Canada. David Farr : 100% trade discussions, 100%, because that\u2019s once will not move forward in North America. And I\u2019ve told the White House there, I\u2019ve told anybody in Washington is that they will not move forward. Because the \u2013 our Asia in particular, China need these \u2013 needed to off take, the processing, semi-process stuff. And without some agreement, these investments will sit there. Now they can move forward pretty quickly, because of where they sit, but without the agreements going forward in some clarity around the trade discussions between the United States and China. These natural gas investments will not move forward. Because even if 50% of that investment is going to be for exporting, 50% internally, your whole process is going to change. So that\u2019s very important. So I think what I see in Southern Texas and Southern Louisiana, and it goes back to my comment about, they\u2019re going to sit there for a while for 12 to 14 or where that number is and then they\u2019ll make that call relative to we reevaluate or do we go back to the drawing board? Joe Ritchie : That makes sense. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Hi, how are you? Good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon. Andrew Obin : Just a question on your investment strategy, because I know part of the strategy was to investment service capability, flow control capability, also discrete investments to sort of update the product. So how should we think about your internal investment product processes given to slow down? David Farr : We\u2019re going through a very serious prioritization of where we\u2019re going to go on the investment and the discrete through the investment around the GE bolt-on acquisition and invest between our process side and the ovation side, the power side. That\u2019s very important to us. And we\u2019re going to try \u2013 we\u2019re going to figure out how we get that done over the next two years, as we planned originally. On the service side, given the opportunity we\u2019ve been seeing in KOB3 and I think KOB3 will come in at a very good number this year, because we\u2019re trying to keep that number well above 50% in that cycle. We\u2019re going to figure out how we can continue those investments going and that stopped them. But again, it goes back to a reprioritization of what we can do and we cannot do. And I would say in my discussions will allow and my discussions will run, the OC members. That\u2019s one area that I would say, we need to figure out how to protect. Now we may modulate a little bit Andrew, but that\u2019s an area I think we continue to have opportunities for growth and penetration for the long-term. And I don\u2019t want to be short cycle, blinded and missed this opportunity. So I think you\u2019re going to see us continue to modulate and continue to move forward in that area. It\u2019s been very good for us so far. Andrew Obin : Thanks. And just a follow-up question, you always have a very good sense of what Global Macro is doing, what Global GFI doing, et cetera. Just looking at the world today, what would you guess as U.S. GDP and China GDP are growing at right now? David Farr : U.S. right now is growing low-2s. I think there\u2019s \u2013 I think, it will continue to slide again. You could easily go below the 2 at this current point in time until we get some clarity around trade, it actually go below that 2 level next years \u2013 we move into next year. I think China is continue to grow, but I think it\u2019s more of a like a 3 % or 4% type of growth rate in China. And we seem pretty good pockets of growth. And if Bob\u2019s business, the commercial residential business has back to back, you say, two or three or four months of slightly positive growth that tells me that things have stabilized. So the global economy is definitely slowed. And from my perspective right now, we\u2019ve got the Feds around the world and trying to figure out how to keep that growth rate up from hitting the stall speed. But the trade issues right now are quite a big negative and being pushed back that growth rate down. So that\u2019s the key offset and going on at this point in time. Andrew Obin : Thanks a lot Dave. David Farr : All the best to you. Take care. Operator : And our next question will come from Deepa Raghavan of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Deepa Raghavan : Good afternoon, Dave. David Farr : Good afternoon, Deepa. Deepa Raghavan : Automation Solutions, Dave, so China continues to invest in infrastructure and that\u2019s been helping a lot of companies there this cycle. But what are some of the verticals within AS, that have been performing better than you\u2019d have thought in that region. And which are the ones that are losing some steam versus your expectations? I have a follow-up after that. David Farr : So you\u2019re talking about China and specific Deepa, that we\u2019ve said there China. Deepa Raghavan : Yes, China Automation Solutions, yes. David Farr : Yes. So from the power standpoint, we\u2019ve seen China lose some steam that they\u2019re underperforming, I thought they would underperform. There\u2019s been a shifting around of priorities within the power industry. So that one has underperformed inside China from what I thought would happen that\u2019s earlier this year. On the \u2013 so the chemical side, I think, that process I\u2019ve seen those are held in there pretty well nicely, some of the refining investments that held in there pretty nicely. I would say that, if I look at some of the pipeline investments, they\u2019ve held in there pretty, pretty well. In the beginning of year, I believe if I went back and looked at when I gave a first forecast in China and we were talking around a 6% to 8%, 9%or something like that, 6%, 8%, 10% \u2013 8% to 10%.So that\u2019s basically where we are right now. So I would say chemical is little bit better, power is little bit worse and refining is little bit better. So that\u2019s where it is. We\u2019re pretty close to where we thought we would be. And it\u2019s \u2013 as you said, it\u2019s shift around industries a little bit. And that\u2019s how I see it right now. Deepa Raghavan : Got it. Thanks for the color. My follow-up is on cost controls. Are you taking costs down along the verticals that are weak? Or is that more broad based across Emerson? David Farr : Broad based across Emerson. So we\u2019ve set in motion Bob\u2019s business in the commercial residential Bob Sharps, he\u2019s gone through its process with his team and looking at places that we can take out layers, we can take out in situations \u2013 not necessarily needed anymore. Lal is doing the same thing, we\u2019re trying to accelerate some of the integration and some of the acquisitions and we\u2019re looking at the corporate structure and the same thing. So we\u2019re looking at areas that from the standpoint of things we can do simpler without as much overhead. We\u2019re trying to figure out how to do that right now and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going at it. So it\u2019s very people focused in the near \u2013 that we started in April and we\u2019ll run all the way to in this calendar year to make sure, we have things tuned the way we want them tuned for this type of environment. Deepa Raghavan : Great, thanks very much. Thanks for fitting me in. David Farr : You\u2019re welcome, Deepa. Operator : Our next question will come from Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. David Farr : Gautam, you\u2019ve got the last question. You just got \u2013 you barely [indiscernible] Gautam Khanna : Well, lot of questions have been asked and answered. One thing I was curious about is the June board meeting, I\u2019m just curious what the high level framework is on buybacks. I recognize the 250 you mentioned in Q4, but is there an appetite if there\u2019s not much in the way of M&A over the next 6 to 12 months to really pump the repurchase activity higher? David Farr : I don\u2019t think \u2013 we show the board a range of \u2013 what we see cash flow doing, what we see our capital allocation from the standpoint \u2013 from the balance sheet, the leverage we have. We try to keep enough flexibility. If we had to do several medium larger site types of deals being \u2013 a couple of billion to $3 billion, $4 billion. So I think that right now the board feels very comfortable in this range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion per year in share repurchase. Assuming that the deal, whether we\u2019re looking at is moderate of somewhere between $0.5 billion to $1 billion per year. If we alter that and we start moving back into that $1 billion to $1.5 billion to $2 billion, you would see as modulate back down towards, I would say a little bit under $1 billion in share repurchase. So we show the board that flexibility, but I don\u2019t see if the deal would really \u2013 it\u2019s not going to stop. And I mean, I don\u2019t see us pop and everything, all our capital into share repurchase. I think, we\u2019ve consistently bought stock back over the years. As Tim knows, it\u2019s close to 300 million shares that we bought back over the \u2013 since 2000. Now the net impact not quite that high, but we bought back 300 million shares. And so we consistently are in the marketplace, but I don\u2019t see us changing the strategy of buying on a consistent basis. And I think the board feels very comfortable in a 750 to $1.5 billion based on what our acquisitions is. Hence, that\u2019s why we talked the board about taking up a little bit higher this year. And now with 2020 hindsight, the fact that the market\u2019s gotten weaker, it gives us some flexibility by some of reasonable prices. Gautam Khanna : Appreciate the color, thank you. David Farr : Take care, Gautam. I want to thank everybody for your time. I appreciate it. As you guys know, I try to be very candid about what\u2019s going on. And I do want to let you know that Rocket\u2019s one year birthday is today and doing is about five, I think he\u2019s four months old. And Doon is a little bit different than Rocket. Doon is a little bit more aggressive. And so Rocket and Tim go together. I got to get a breadth of Investor Relations guy now. So that\u2019s what it is.

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded today, November 5, 2019. Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements including the Company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Reeves, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Mr. Reeves the floor is yours, sir. Tim Reeves : Okay. Thank you, Mike. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Lal Karsanbhai, Executive President Automation Solutions; Bob Sharp, Executive President, Commercial and Residential Solutions and introducing Pete Lilly, the incoming and upgraded Director of Investor Relations, who will surely not mispronounce Frank's name. Welcome to Emerson's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Please follow along in the Slide presentation, which is available on our website. I'll start on Slide 3 with the full-year performance report card. 2019 required our organization to be nimble and responsive to a lower growth environment than we had expected a year ago and we did respond. On our second quarter earnings conference call, we began talking about additional restructuring actions and we did so again on our Q3 call in August. In total, we executed $35 million of additional actions in the second half and on October 1st, we announced our Board's review of further actions appropriate for the lower growth environment we see over the next couple of years. Underlying sales finished the year up 3% versus our initial guide of 4% to 7%. We saw slower than expected growth across both platforms, Automation Solutions grew 5%, which was mostly driven by efforts targeting our broad installed base. We saw large capital projects start to push out in Q2 and that trend continued through the second half. Commercial and Residential Solutions saw a sharp decline in Asia in the first quarter and was a headwind to growth all year. Cooler weather hampered residential growth in North America and professional tools and cold chain markets began to slow through the second half as non-residential investment slowed. Despite slower growth, we delivered just above our EPS guidance helped by lower tax rate and lower corporate costs. Importantly, we had a strong cash flow for full year, delivering free cash flow at $2.4 billion, which was up 6% and reflected 105% free cash flow conversion. This drove dividends as a percent of free cash flow down to 50% a critical milestone. In 2019, we completed our 63rd year consecutive dividend increases and returned $2.5 billion to investors including $1.25 billion of share repurchases, which was above our initial target of $1 billion. Today, we announced a $0.04 dividend increase in 2020. Please turn to Slide 4. Fourth quarter results were above the high end of EPS guidance discussed on the third quarter conference call, helped by a $0.09 discrete tax benefit. Automation solutions was in line with guidance with 5% underlying growth in Q4 and full year EBIT margin of 16% spot on with guidance. Trends in the business continued into Q4 with slowing global discrete markets and soft North American upstream activity. Demand in global process in hybrid markets remained stable. Commercial and residential solutions end markets were slower than expected and the business deleveraged on lower growth. Q4 underlying sales were down 2% compared to our expectation that the business will be up slightly in the quarter. Our fourth quarter free cash flow generation was up significantly versus prior year and we completed the $250 million of additional share buybacks announced on our Q3 call. Turning to Slide 5. Fourth quarter gross margin was up 70 basis points to 42.8% and full-year margins were 42.5% demonstrating strong price leverage and cost disciplines. SG&A cost as a percent of sales fell 180 basis points as our businesses effectively control costs. Operational SG&A spend was lower compared to the prior year and also lowered sequentially compared to the third quarter. Lower corporate expenses also contributed to this improvement, lower stock compensation and the favorable impact of the prior year one-time 401(k) contributions. Reported EBIT margin was up 140 basis points. In 2020, we will report adjusted margins, which exclude the impact of restructuring charges consistent with our new adjusted EPS framework, which we'll discuss in detail shortly. 2019 adjusted EBITDA margin was up 210 basis points to 22.8%.The quarter benefited from discrete tax items similar to the prior year. Fourth quarter EPS was up 20% excluding these discrete tax items from both years. Turning now to Slide 6. From a geographic perspective, we saw mixed results in Q4. In total, mature markets were down 1% underlying in the quarter and up 2% for the year. U.S. industrial activity softened a bit in Q4, somewhat offset by stronger Western Europe. Emerging markets were up 8% underlying in Q4 and up 4% for the year. Strong fourth quarter emerging market investment activity was led by China, up 9%. Latin America up double digits and Middle East and Africa up 8%. Turning now to Slide 7. Total segment margin was up 10 basis points, including recent acquisitions. Total adjusted segment margin was up 50 basis points to 20.2%. This improvement reflects greater than 40% year-over-year and sequential leverage. We've updated our reporting of corporate and other costs. Previously, we showed two numbers, the differences in accounting methods line, which included a management charge to the operating segments and certain pension and post-retirement costs and the corporate and other line that included corporate operations, total company stock comp expense, acquisition and related -- acquisition related costs and other items. Going forward, we will present three-line to more clearly show the pension and post-retirement cost the corporate, the stock compensation expense, and the corporate and other line, which includes the cost of corporate net of the charge to the businesses, acquisition related costs and other items. We believe this presentation provides greater clarity and is more in line with how our peers report. Q4 cash flow was strong. Free cash flow of $1 billion was over 20% of sales and free cash flow conversion in the quarter was 140%. Turning to Slide 8. Automation solutions underlying sales were up 5% in the quarter and up 5% for the full year. September trailing three-month underlying orders were up 4% excluding two large nonrecurring power projects in the prior year. Strong demand continue to cross MRO spending and brownfield projects supported by primary demand, growth programs focused on our installed base. We continue to see long cycle bookings, with the September backlog for final control and systems businesses up 6%; however, our large project funnel continue to stall, as customers' capital spending plans push out due to trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainty. North America underlying sales were down slightly as discrete and upstream markets continued to soften. Strong growth continued in Latin America. Demand in Europe was stable in the quarter and underlying sales growth accelerated on strong backlog conversion. Asia, underlying growth was broad-based led by China, which was up 18%. Strong growth in Middle East and Africa was driven by long cycle investment activity. Automation Solutions segment margin was up 70 basis points including significant restructuring investments executed in the quarter. Adjusted segment margins was up 140 basis points to 19.5%. For the full year, excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, automation solutions delivered over 30% leverage on an adjusted basis. Turning to Slide 9. Commercial and Residential Solutions underlying sales were down 2% in the quarter and down 1% for the year. September trailing three-month underlying orders were down 2%. North America underlying sales were down slightly with cooler weather affecting key HVAC markets. Additionally, slower industrial markets weighed on professional tools and cold chain demand. Latin America demand remained solid. Underlying sales in Europe were down slightly reflecting weaker trends in cold chain market somewhat offset by steady growth and heating and commercial air conditioning markets. Asia, Middle East, and Africa was down 7% underlying with China down 9%, primarily reflecting modest declines in commercial air conditioning in the cold chain markets partially offset by steady growth in professional tools. Commercial and Residential Solutions margin decreased 120 basis points and adjusted margin decreased 110 basis points. Lower profitability primarily reflected deleverage on lower volume and unfavorable mix, partially offset by favorable price cost. Let's turn to Slide 10, which outlines our 2020 guidance framework. With the slowing macroeconomic backdrop and continuing geopolitical tension, we are planning for a lower no growth environment in 2020. For the full year, we expect underlying sales growth of down 2% to up 2% with Automation Solutions down 1% to up 3% and Commercial and Residential Solutions down 3% to up 1%. We expect reported sales to be slightly down with a point of FX headwind on the stronger dollar. As Emerson has consistently done during economic slowdowns throughout our history, we have just a shifted our management and investment focus from a growth mindset to cost. We started this process in Q2 and in total, we increased restructuring investments to $35 million in the second half of 2019. As announced on October 1st, the Board initiated a review of operations, capital allocation, and portfolio initiatives, the 2020 outlook framework presented here does not include any potential implications of the Board's review. At our February Investor Conference, we expect to present a detail the outcome of the Board's review and an updated 2020 framework -- outlook framework. Although we anticipate significant restructuring investments in 2020 as a result of the Board's review, our adjusted guidance framework excludes restructuring charges entirely. That is we have zero restructuring charges built into the outlook. Adjusted EPS guidance also excludes significant discrete tax items. We expect adjusted EPS for 2020 in the range of $3.48 to $3.72 against a 2019 adjusted EPS of $3.69. The guidance focuses on operational improvement and margin expansion to drive earnings growth, which is more than offset by $0.29 of headwinds related to tax, unfavorable FX, higher stock compensation due to higher stock price and higher pension expense due to lower discount rates. In 2020, we anticipate another strong cash flow year, as we continue to drive operations execution and incremental cash flow from recent acquisitions. 2020 operating cash flow is expected to be $3.1 billion and free cash flow conversion north of 100%. Please turn to Slide 11, which bridges our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance.The starting point for the bridge is 2019 GAAP EPS of $3.71 and walking across to adjusted 2019 adjusted EPS of $3.69 by excluding $0.14 of favorable discrete tax items and adding back $0.12 of restructuring charges. Now walking from $3.69, we discussed first the $0.29 of headwinds next year. First, tax, the 2019 adjusted tax rate is 21.6% excluding the discrete tax items last year. This is 1.4 points better than expected 2020 rate of 23% resulting in a $0.06 EPS headwind. Second, FX, the stronger dollar results in an FX translation headwind next year assuming October 31 FX rates hold for the remainder of 2020, we anticipate $200 million unfavorable impact in net sales, resulting in a $0.04 EPS headwind. And finally, stock compensation and pension. Stock comp is up due to higher stock price and pension cost increase this year due to lower discount rates. Partially offsetting these headwinds, we expect to drive $0.08 of operational improvement on flat to down sales, which reflects 30 basis points to 50 basis points of improvement in adjusted total segment margin. We also expect $0.12 of EPS from our improved debt cost structure and strong balance sheet with $1.5 billion of share repurchases. Please turn to Slide 12, which bridges our first quarter 2020 adjusted EPS guidance. For Q1 last year, we add back a penny for restructuring charges to $0.75. There were no discrete tax items in the quarter last year. The 2020 bridge for Q1, looks a lot like the full year bridge with half of the headwinds we discussed in the full year impact the first quarter. This is because Q1 last year benefited from lower stock compensation due to the decline in our stock price in late December, as oil prices fell. In total, we faced $0.13 of headwinds, which were partially offset by $0.02 contribution from operations and $0.03 from shares and interest. These items provide $0.05 of EPS contribution, which is proportional to the $0.20 we expect in the full year. And now, please turn to Slide 13 and I will hand the call over to Mr. David Farr. David Farr : Thank you very much, Tim and thank you very much for your service as Investor Relations and going out sort with a bang. It's an interesting time we've been having here. But I want to thank all the employees around the world for their support through Fiscal 2019. They did accomplish a lot in a very challenging marketplace. And I want to welcome everybody on the call today, as we talk about what we're seeing in the marketplace and what we see going here going forward. But it's been a very dynamic time period as we all know. It's a challenging time period, but the management team across this Company, both here in St. Louis and around the world is very, very focused on delivering increased operational margins and a 0% underlying growth period. If the growth is better, better for us; if it's not, we're ready for it and that's what we're doing. I also want to thank all the sell-side analysts and the shareholders that have met with Tim and I over the last 60 days and talked to us as we look sought your inputs, which we conveyed back to the Board, as we've gone through this process to make sure the Board understood, where our shareholders stood today and what they expected of us. So if I look at where we're going right now, and you see that the order pattern in Chart 13, preliminary numbers for October, if I look at automation solutions, they drifted down a little bit but not much, running around I think around 3% underlying growth rate. Bob's business is sort of flat lining here around this negative 1 to 0% growth rate for the last couple of months. And overall, we are as a corporation looking at 1% underlying growth rate right now. As we know, we believe we're facing a very challenging time in 2020 and we are getting ready for that, and I'll have more comments on that as we go forward here. If you look through the Chart 14, the history of Emerson from the years that we've gone through different cycles through period that I've been leading the Company as a CEO from 2000 to 2019. We have continue to the change the composition of the Company, we've continued to invest in the Company, we've divested close to 55% of the Company's assets since I've become CEO. We repositioned and invested in new companies in our automation business invested in new companies in our commercial, residential business and we've driven our gross profit to very good levels. Our target is to get the number back into that 44 and plus percent range over the next couple of years, but we -- from an industrial operation standpoint, we know what we're doing here. We know how to invest in technology to drive higher gross profit and to drive what I'd call renewable type of business model as I look at our aftermarket business going forward. We've had very good through underlying growth rates throughout the economic cycle. Yes, there are cycles. And yes, we're facing a cycle right now and I believe this team is focused on how we're going to improve the profitability and drive as much growth as we can for our shareholders going forward here in the next couple of years. If you look at Chart 15 from the EBITDA margin standpoint over the time period, Emerson 21%, our weighted average peer is around 16%. Our Commercial and Residential Solutions business, is a very profitable business, a business run that runs through cycles a little bit different, a little less cyclical, runs around 25% EBITDA versus our peer group around 15%. Automation Solutions business also a very, very good business, it's been built up over a long, long time. I ran it many, many years ago, but I'd say the current leadership team is far better than I ever was back when I was running it in the late '90s but running an EBITDA around 20% versus our 15%, but we believe we have opportunities here to drive this EBITDA margins back up to its peak levels and to enhance our profitability, as we go forward in the next couple of years, and we'll be talking about that a little bit more. If you look at our digital transformation capabilities today, we now have a very large installed base, close to $120 billion in our automation world. We have a capability with the -- our digital capability today both from a hardware standpoint and a system standpoint and we're driving unique business model around that while creating a new business within that, the focus specifically on is higher tech transformation opportunities and we have a very good start in this business today. You're going to hear more about that, as we now start talking about what we're doing, what we have to offer here, but it's really a truly unique differentiation that we have and really from the standpoint of our $120 billion installed base, it's quite unique to come off of. And I'm -- we're very, very excited about it and we'll continue to invest in that even through a tough time, we will continue to invest in that. I also want to thank Lal and Ram and his whole team in the first couple of years of the Valves and Controls work, it's really created unique shareholder value for us, from an EBITDA standpoint, the pro forma of 2017. If you look at 2019, we're now over $600 million of EBITDA and EBITDA margins are now up 16%. We fundamentally have room to go. We made a commitment to our shareholders that we would get to 20%, we will get to 20%. We are doing the necessary action to get to that level. It is a step by step basis and we're under way right now. We've decreased the number of facilities, you'll see more of that in 2020. We've driven out working capital on a combined basis when we took over V&C that number is close to 50% and on a combined basis, the Final Control was 35 total and we're now down to 26. We're doing a lot of different things here to drive value both from the customer perspective, but equally just important for our shareholder perspective and a lot more to go here for Ram and his team and Lal, as they go forward with this integration process and we will continue to accelerate that in 2020 and '21. We've also continued to drive a lot of cash and back to our shareholders. If you look at our Emerson capital allocation over the last 10 years, we paid back to our shareholders in $10 billion a share repurchase, $12 billion of dividends, acquisitions we've done $10 billion worth, capital spending we've done about $6 billion worth. So we've continued to invest in the Company, continued to investment in technology and we continue to give back to our shareholders. In the last 10 years, that number of 57% of our cash flow goes back to our shareholders. This year we're over 60% as we drove back our dividend and as we grow back our share repurchase, we clearly had money to give back to the shareholders, we did not have as many as acquisitions and our intention is to give the money back if we can't use it internally. On a return basis, as a company over the last 10 years, our return on total capital has been 18%. It is a number that goes up and down, as we make acquisitions, the number will drift down, as we integrate those numbers will drift up and over the time if you look through it. It does go up and down, but we drive at very high levels of return on total capital, a very important metric for us, both from cash standpoint, from a sales standpoint and margin standpoint, but returns on our investments from the shareholders' perspective is something it's high in our mind at all times. If you look at the Chart 19, the only thing I want to point out is we go through the different cycles. You look at Emerson and you look at our G7 or G7 with China, the numbers cycle around. We are definitely in a downward drift right now. The concern I have, as I look at 2020, as I look at the GFI numbers right now, they're under 1%. That tells me we are facing a very challenging time period. I'm waiting for the catalyst to cause it to turn. There are a lot of people who believe that we'll see a second half recovery. We are not planning on that. We are planning on getting the cost out, getting our margins moving upward in a no-growth environment. If we did grow, then we'll leverage nicely. But right now, what I see and I've been in this game, a long time, as you all know, I see a very challenging environment for at least 12 months, it could be 18 months and we'll see what that catalysts is that drive that. I firmly believe there will be a bounce back up. This cycle has been artificially depressed of the geopolitical issues, the trade issues, and I'm looking at what does it take to bounce it, from my standpoint, we're betting on a slow global growth for the next year, a challenging growth for us and we're adjusting accordingly. We are going through the repositioning review with the Board right now. We have a lot of work to do. The effort is under way. It has been under way for several months. We will come back out to the shareholders later, after the first quarter and getting into that in February Investors call. But I'll tell you what I'm thinking right now. We are trying to aggressively advance our restructuring efforts. You're going to see in the first quarter restructuring number around $70 million and basically what we see at this point in time between Lal's business, between corporate and Bob. We're looking at around $70 million of restructuring on top of what we just did in the fourth quarter incrementally was $35 million higher. As I look at the total plan from the late 2019 to '20 to '21, early '22, I would say right now, you should be factoring somewhere between $200 and $300 of restructuring as we go back to drive our EBITDA margins, or EBIT margins to record levels to high levels, and that focus is under way. The work will be done and reviewed with the Board in the coming months and then we'll share that with the outside investors, but we're well under way and we're going to take a significant hit in this first quarter, as we really action around things that should be done and to get going on this and that will come through and we report our final GAAP numbers. It's not in the numbers that we presented to you today, but it will be around $70 million and I would expect that number obviously never hit exactly, it's going be plus or minus, but that's what we're talking about in the first quarter, up from what we just spent in the fourth quarter of our Fiscal year. So if you look at what's going on right now, the Board has is looking at operational review, looking at total cost structure across the Company, both on Bob's business, our corporate organization and Lal's business, how can we optimize the cost structure to get back to driving record levels of EBITDA margins, EBIT margins. We've hired outside global consulting firm to work with us to look at the pinch points to make sure we're not missing something. We consider ourselves very good operating people, but having a different perspective is something is very valuable. And that's why we brought in somebody to look at this and that's under way. Again, we will review that with the Board, the Board wants engagement in this and we're going to make sure that we take a hard look at that with the Board in early February. We're also looking at the capital structure, we're looking at our capital allocation, where we see spending money, the next couple of years, how much we see in acquisitions, how much we see going back at dividends, how much we see going back in share repurchase, how much we see going back into capital spending. Again, we're looking at where we're going to spend the money, as we go forward here. I know that we're going to put more money into capital as we rebase some of our cost structure. I also know that we will continue to drive operating cash flow and free cash flow, which will allow us to increase our dividend, as we drive down toward 45% of dividend payout versus free cash flow. We're at 50% this year and we want to get back down to 45% level. And finally, we'll take a look at all of the portfolio of Emerson, what assets makes sense, what asset don't make sense, what we can do if anything, what we can do with some of these assets, some of the businesses. This is something we do all the time, but we really put a little bit more effort into it. We like to look at this, especially when we go into a downturn allows us a remix and it also allows us to have a chance to say, where do we want to invest from an acquisition standpoint. So everything's on the table. We had a two-day Board meeting this week on Monday and Tuesday, and we're looking forward to sharing a lot of the insights with the shareholders in our February Investor Conference, which is I think February 13th in the New York City at the famous Stock Exchange, which everyone loves to go to, but it's a good price point from a standpoint of costs. And so that's why I'm looking at it from that perspective. But I want to know -- let you know that the Board and the Senior Management are very focused on how we can drive improved profitability, improve profit margins and also drive growth. We're not walking away from growth. But we know we are facing a challenging market. I know the entire organization around the world is focused on that. We're also making the right investments for the next generation technology, the next-generation area that really will drive growth and we're getting ready for what I would say a bounce back in the marketplace when it does happen. In the meantime, we're very, very much focused on driving that value for our shareholders through that margin improvement, the cash flow, and we're very much focused on driving that cash and paying back more money to our shareholders in 2020. Through the higher dividend increase of $0.04 this year, assuming we continue that and also share repurchase of $1.5 billion this year. So our forecast right now says we're paying back more money to our shareholders in 2020 and we are also looking to drive higher operating cash flow. With that, I'm going to open the mic and allow first questions and we'll go from there. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question we have will come from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to say thanks to Tim for all the help over the past several years. In terms of maybe the first question, David. So there's been a lot of sort of back and forth between D.E Shaw and Emerson and we saw that press release this morning, how would you characterize where you stand vis-a-vis D.E. Shaw right now and also when you're thinking about the Board changes we saw the Mark playing announcement, should we expect further Board changes in the quarters ahead? David Farr : Okay. Thank you very much. So what I'd like to do here is sort of deal with this issue right upfront here and then not have that question come out to me for the rest of the day. I want to focus on Emerson and what we're trying to do here. But first of all, we get input as you all know from every shareholder and it's been part of Emerson DNA for a long, long time. It's how we operate and the Board review announced in October was the combination of discussion with the Board over the last six months and the consistent with how Emerson addresses challenging macroeconomic slowdown. The Board's decision was shaped by input from all our shareholders. That's why I went out and I asked so many of our shareholders. I talked to nearly 40% of our shareholders over the last two months. The Board members have joined me on several of these phone calls and meetings. It's important for them to hear it. The Board understands our strong position as a company and the Board supports that we have heard from our shareholders and the Board will continue to make the right decisions for the long-term for all of our shareholders. We appreciate your inputs, as I said earlier from everybody that I've talked to, over the last 60 days. It is important that we -- the shareholders to know that we are in control of our own destiny here. We are in control of what needs to be done with our strategy. Now, as I look at what we announced this morning and with Mark -- what we have been looking at for the last couple of years is we have two Directors, who will be retiring in early 2021. The Board Corporate Governance Committee have been looking at candidates for quite some time. We've had two candidates that we've been working on. We had an input from a shareholder. The Board took a look at it. He was a very interesting person from the standpoint, every Board member met this individual, went through a very rigorous process and we made the decision as a Board to move into the front line versus the other two candidates that we have at this point in time. Mark has unique skill sets. He has a unique experience in the industry. He took a company through a major repositioning effort or restructuring effort. He has enormous Board experience being on the Texas Instrument Board as a Lead Director. He has an interesting background also from a CFO standpoint. He is on the Board Legrand Platt, and he is on the Board of other companies, which really do bring value to us. So, the Board made the decision that Mark fits exactly what we're looking for any moved to the front of queue and we brought him on. And from my perspective, at this point in time I think he's been a fantastic addition. Mark -- I've known Mark for several years and I'm looking forward to his inputs relative what's going on in the industry. And I think that obviously we listen to shareholders and we are totally in control of our destiny at this point in time. Our objective right now is to execute, execute around what I've been talking the Board about and what I've been talking to my shareholders about. We are in total control of our own destiny and I want to say, Mark, was a very good addition to our Board. Don't be surprised if I don't add another Director in 2020, late 2020, because I do have this Director that will be retiring in late or early '21 and I need to make sure that I find a replacement for her, at the same time. I'm looking for a diverse candidate there and the Board is looking at that at the same time, so Julian, I appreciate that and I want you -- if you have another question, you might want to ask, go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Sure. Maybe looking at some of the other investor suggestions that have been floating around, I think on the portfolio you've made it clear that sort of many things are on the table, maybe on the restructuring aspect, how do you and the board think about balancing that need for cost efficiency against also the need to keep investing given a lot of changes that are going on in the automation world right now. David Farr : It's a very important point for the Board at this point in time, the Board is very focused on trying to make sure that we're not jeopardizing the future of this company. We've done several large acquisitions in the last 2 or 3 years. We're taking -- we're taking a very strong focus on how we can integrate those businesses, how do we get our cost structure, improved there. We're taking a hard look at the touch points between the corporate and the businesses and as I committed to the Board, both Bob and Lal had to commit to the Board yesterday because they asked the question, the same question is asked us how you making sure you're not jeopardizing the future of the Company, just because you're trying to get to the short-term type of goals. That's not something Emerson does. We over the time has been a technology leader, we've been an industry leaders, the industry and we have not -- have no intention to damage that going forward and these guys talk later on, you can ask the same question, but these guys are very much focused on the key strategic areas we have opportunities in the size of the Company to take our cost down and do things better. We have some excess facilities through acquisitions. We have a unique opportunity to do some best cost job moves by building some new facility. So, Julian, it's -- it's a very important issue for the Board, because they do not want to make sure that Dave Farr in his last two years, does things short-term orient and then hands it over to the next generation, say, oh, \"shit\" and so I guarantee. That's on the forefront of the Board and they will be challenging me, they'll be challenging Bob and Lal to make sure that they do that. Bob, you guys want to say anything or Lal, you want to say anything along those lines. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, David, thank you. This is Lal Karsanbhai. We've been looking at this weaker environment for some time now in operating in a world that's changed since we last spoke in February. And we've been accelerating restructuring across the platform, as we executed to Q3 and Q4 and as we look at the opportunities today, we are focused around structure across the enterprise, we structure we're prioritizing enhancements in speed and execution. And the key priority for my management team is around protecting our customer touch points and protecting our technology and that's how we're working around the opportunity. David Farr : Bob, anything you want to add there? Bob Sharp : Yes, I'd say -- Investor Call again in February, where we talk more. I'll show you several examples of programs will drive and we continue to drive both to expand the serve market we have and get growth and it is a challenging trade off when you get a situation like this , but we are continuing to fund those and from our restructuring and cost standpoint, we're very heavily focused on the gross profit side of things in the plants and product cost and such, so we're going to use that to also help fund some of the key sales programs. David Farr : Yes. I think the important point Julian, anything else before I pass it on the next person. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just one last one, you talked about slowing growth in North America, I think on Slide 6, just wondering if you could give a bit more update on within automation solution specifically is all the weakness in North America still focused on upstream and discrete or do you see it spreading. David Farr : I'll let Lal answer that question, since he is an expert in this and I'm just a CEO. Lal Karsanbhai : I got that. Thanks, David. Julian, the weakness that we experienced in the second quarter leading through the year on discrete continues and has continued through to the fourth quarter and then to what we currently see in the environment. Likewise, we continue to see stresses around the upstream and midstream, oil and gas value chain in North America with very little spending and more acceleration of spending in the, in those markets. I have not yet seen a broader slowdown in process, particularly resi relates to MRO spend. Having said that, the North America capital environment slowed down, it's been delayed, it's been impacted by the geopolitical and general economic situation. Julian Mitchell : Thank you very much, Lal. David Farr : Well, we should move forward who is up next. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks. Julian. Thank you. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. Operator : And the next question we have will come from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. David Farr : Good afternoon, Mr. Tusa. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Just on the -- on the organic guidance, I mean you're starting the year up model was for the first quarter on organic your -- you know negative two to positive, I would think in climate at some point in the next, I don't know like 10 quarters you guys will have somewhat of an easy comp, at some stage of the game. What is really bugging you within Automation Solutions , especially given you have, I mean it is process, it's kind of a backlog related business and you should, the MRO business shouldn't be that the lack of visibility there shouldn't be that. What exactly is the driver that kind of gets you to below the flat line for the year on organic. David Farr : I think -- see, it's a fair question, given where we are in the -- from the backlog standpoint, in the order plan standpoint. I'll give you my perspective and let Lal and Bob give you two seconds on this too. From my perspective, what's scaring me is I look at the last couple of months starting -- I started talking about concern about 2019, late 2019, early 2000, back back in April, but in the last two or three months, I've seen the global GFI numbers really roll off and when I see a number that goes now GFI forecast for 2020 drop now below 1%, it scares me from the standpoint, okay guys. At the current pace, we see maybe says it doesn't do that, maybe should be better than that as you say, but I'm more concerned about the fact that the trend line between the geopolitical, the tariffs, the trade all these different discussions right now are driving this much weaker gross fixed investment number. When I see a number go below one, historically, we move really quickly toward a zero or a negative number on underlying sales, so what -- so from my perspective, what I'm doing right now is say guys, we are driving to zero or negative number underlying growth. I understand there's investment opportunities out there, but we've got to figure out how to get the cost structure set at that zero standpoint Steve, because I'm concerned, that's something is going to happen here from an election standpoint or Europe or something happens in the Middle East and the GFI forecast numbers are really going to happen. If that happens, we are going to be looking at a very low growth. So I would say I'm being driven by that caution and I think that until we see that catalysts that drives that back up, you're right It should be from a catalytic standpoint, at some point a balance. But I'm not willing to say we're going to see that balance yet until I start sensing, the underlying economic numbers get better or stabilize. I don't see that yet. So that's where it's coming from. Steve Tusa : At the low end of that range, what does that imply for your short cycle discrete business, which I would assume is going to be the the leader of that kind of negative view in the context of your other businesses, what are kind of low end of declines in discrete? David Farr : Lal, go ahead. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. On the broader -- on the broader process of the issue. David Farr : Yes and don't forget the discrete question. Lal Karsanbhai : I'll come back to that. Steve, the capital discipline that we see out there the spending disciplines, the way our customers are looking at where they put that dollar today is where we've got to really assess how that looks goes forward. We've seen that slowdown in North America in oil and gas. We've seen in the discrete globally. I have not seen and likely will not see tied to this economic cycle of turning the discrete markets as you -- closely tied to GDP and GFI trends and we are yet to see a recovery across the broad, discrete markets, whether that's automotive, semiconductor, packaging, textiles, et cetera. And I don't foresee that coming back. So as I think about discrete in that mix, it's somewhere in the mid-single digit negative at the low end of the forecast. Steve Tusa : Okay. That's great. I'll leave it there. Thanks guys. David Farr : Okay. Anything you want anything from Bob. Anything want to ask Bob on? Steve Tusa : I'll just pick few questions. I'll leave it there. David Farr : Bob will make a statement here then. Since you won't ask him a question, Bob, once you can make a comment because Tusa doesn't like you enough. Bob Sharp : Well, I would just say I think you know that of my order visibility gives me about 12 to 14 days of outlook and so it's hard to see beyond that. Challenge right now is the softness is just so widespread whether it's general, industrial, commercial AC's pretty weak right now, cold chain is you watch the industry numbers right now, they are challenging. So it's hard to build a 2020 plan right now on the recovery of any sort, if it happens, that will be great. If it doesn't, what we're dialing in to do is improve margin without the growth and that's where all the focus is right now. David Farr : Thank you very much, Steve. I appreciate. Who's next. Operator : Yes, sir. That question will come from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon, Dave. David Farr : Good afternoon, Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : So maybe just starting with a follow-on on the restructuring Slide. Let's say we do get like $200 million to $300 million cost of restructuring framework, should we think about that product like mostly dropping to the bottom line or would there be offset kind of going back to Julien's question, but in a little bit more detail. David Farr : It's going to be, from our standpoint, typically what we're trying to target here, based on the final numbers, we're trying to get back to a record level of EBIT, which was a little bit over 19%. We're trying to get back to our record level. EBITDA, which was around 22.3 and 22.4. So some of the investment will be longer term, the payback of a little longer, but I think that what we're looking at is a mixture of the long-term impact of short-term impact allow us to drive that profitability back those peak level margins with very moderate growth of underlying sales. So I would say that historically when we look at it, we get back a dollar per dollar, it may be over or 18 months period. But it's typically a dollar for dollar and we'll let you know as we lay this out, there are going to be some capital investments, which will be a little longer because we're going to -- we need to build some best cost facilities as we consolidate some our manufacturing and that will be a little bit different payback. But it's definitely, we still always look for dollar plus for that type of investment and that's what we're seeing right now. Nicole DeBlase : Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks. And then just one on the first quarter. Just if you could talk a little bit about what you're embedding in that $0.02 of operational performance accretion maybe like looking at underlying sales growth and expectations for margins in 1Q. David Farr : Yes. So we're looking at basically about 1% underlying sales growth and we're looking at probably a couple of 10th operational margin improvement. The key issue here though is now that does include the 70 -- we're banking on a recovery on the cost investments for acceleration within the fourth quarter, if we get a decent mix, in different growth, hopefully, we'll have a little bit better margin improvement there , but in reality what we're really trying to get geared up for right now Nicole is we're trying to get the -- so it's fast and the cost reduction is done in this first fiscal quarter that's why we're trying to do $70 million, which will allow us to start getting some margin improvement underlying, as we get into that second and third quarter. So we're trying to get this game going faster. I think right now we're ahead of the wave. And I'd like to get a little bit further ahead of the wave and that's how you should feel about us right now. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. Thanks. I'll pass along to someone else. David Farr : Thank you very much Nicole. Hope to see you soon. Operator : And next we have John Walsh of Credit Suisse. John Walsh : Hi, good afternoon. David Farr : Good afternoon, John. John Walsh : I guess maybe a clarifying question first, so the $70 million of restructuring in the first quarter, is there any benefit associated from that restructuring in the current guidance construct of '20? David Farr : No. So what we've built in is no, no benefit improvements on acceleration of restructuring. So when we -- as we start doing this and we lay out the plan, we will tell you what benefit cost is going to be coming in for the cost structure and what benefit we'll get from profits in this year, because we will by getting going in the first quarter, like we are doing right now, both Bob's business and corporate Lal's business, we will get some benefit from incremental EBIT dollars this fiscal year. And so that's why we're pushing really hard to get as much done as possible in this first quarter. If it gets tougher and tougher, go into second, third quarter. So that's why we're trying to front load as much as possible. So the answer is no, we have not booked at any cost nor the benefits, which there will be benefits. John Walsh : Okay. And then looking at the free cash flow, I mean obviously there is some moving pieces on the EPS guide, but free cash flow of $2.5 billion came in line with us in the street, I mean can you talk about some of the levers you have to pull to drive that $2.5 billion of performance and then expectations for that to grow going forward from here, I know you mentioned some capital investments may be to drive the larger restructuring program there? David Farr : So from the standpoint of this next 12 months, I think the best lever we have is from an operational standpoint, can we get our inventory back. I think our inventory has a room to come down a little bit in 2020, as we slowed in the sales growth and our inventory levels did not come down as much as I thought they did do pretty well. But they didn't come down as much, so I think we still have up to a $100 million inventory, we can get out of the Company in 2020. As you go forward, the key issue that is going to drive this is a continued working capital performance in Lal's business, as he continues to integrate his two recent big acquisitions. I think Bob's business is running pretty well tightly right now. I think you guys Tools business running pretty well to the first 12 months and then obviously if we drive our profit, profit drives that cash flow. So we're trying to drive free cash flow level back up, because what we're trying to get back to is, we're trying to get back to that $4 billion operating cash flow, which allows us to get spend the capital that we need up to $675 million to $700 million. We will be also altering our capital spend as we get to understand the restructuring programs, we may have to spend a little bit more than $600 million, which is embedded in that forecast, we may have to spend $6.25 million, but we're also going to keep trying to push the operating cash flow, because I really do want to get our free cash flow to dividend payout back down toward 48, 47 as soon as possible in 2020 or early '21 and so there is a lot of things going on right now, but we're very focused on that cash because we know that's how we drive value. John Walsh : Great. Thank you for the color. And thank you to Tim, for all the help. David Farr : He been a decent guy. I tell you what we're going to find a good job for him. He has really done a yeoman's job the last 60 days and fortunately we'll -- I think well I've find a really good job to recast his skills. You can work out in the gym or something like that. Thanks, John. Operator : Next to have Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. David Farr : Good afternoon, Andrew. I would say the gentle at this end is very loosely described, so you know, we're from the Midwest. I wouldn't call it gentlemen in the Midwest. Andrew Obin : Alright, well, first, I do want to thank Tim for all the help. And I do have a question for Mr. Sharp. Bob Sharp : You still in Suzhou or have you left the property? You're in China? Andrew Obin : I am in China. Yes. Yes I am. We're very exciting. David Farr : What city you're in? Andrew Obin : I was in Shanghai yesterday, seeing our guys. David Farr : Okay. Good. Andrew Obin : Yesterday my time. David Farr : Okay. Andrew Obin : A just a question on lower end of CNRF guidance, what kind of macro scenarios and maybe we can walk what's happening in North America and Asia, would it take for you to sort of hit the lower end of your guidance, because you know comp seem to be fairly easy in Asia and to Steve Tusa's point that North American comps are not that hard either. Bob Sharp : I think to hit the lower end of the scenario, Asia would have to keep going down and it's a little bit hard to tell right now. So I think you're getting a good read right now in the market, it doesn't feel like that's going to happen, but it's really hard to tell right now , month-to-month. And U.S. would have to we will be very difficult and that would probably be the broader industrial kind of a picture hitting the Pro Tools business, the commercial. It will be something more than just like a residential thing. Andrew Obin : Got you. Thank you. And then question for Lal, just a couple of details, A do you include, have you gotten orders. I know that the Saudi facility wasn't Emerson facility, how much of the impact of the repairs was in Q4 and how much if any work you got for first half of next year and the second question, I think there was some talk about sort of a large, like there'll be one order slipping from Q4 into Q1. Is that correct. And are we going to see sort of any recovery from Q4 and Q1 or it's just steady rate from Q4 to Q1 on Automation Solutions? Lal Karsanbhai : Sure, Andrew. So the Saudi facility was largely -- is largely and Emerson facility, both from a control system perspective instrumentation and valves, we saw repair activity, replacement activity through Q4 as the facility came back online very quickly within four weeks the facilities essentially back online. And, but the volume that we took in terms of our equipment to get it back online was not material to the quarter. Having said that, the modernizations that are going to have to take place within app CAG and their sister facility to get that facility modernized and safe with redundancies will have an impact to us. Those projects and are fully defined yet, Andrew, as we've gone through. David Farr : There is still got be multi-million dollar. Andrew Obin : You're going to be very large. As far as the KOB one order that slipped, we had talked about one specifically, we're still working that, it's very much in the work site. I'm trying to close it here with a team in Asia, Jamie in that team, here in November, it may slip into the very much outlooks into Q1. David Farr : So, it did not happen -- still trying to get it. You'll see it, because it'll be a big order and pop. Andrew Obin : Okay. Thank you, gentlemen. David Farr : Again, gentlemen. Andrew Obin : I'll still call you gentleman. David Farr : Yes. Be safe. I know you're just a -- you're gentleman yourself, you be safe and get back to States soon. Okay. Andrew Obin : Thanks. Operator : Next we have, excuse me, Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. David Farr : Good afternoon, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Thank you, Tim. Welcome, Pete. David Farr : Your not in China, are you Joe? You not in China, are you? Joe Ritchie : I am not. Nope. I'm in New York City. I think, I mean, just kind of sometime soon. So, but maybe just talk in China for a second and this potential trade impact Our guys have been writing about peak trade pain today and basically that being behind us. If we get, if we get -- if we move forward in sign Phase 1, how long do you think it will take to kind of rekick-start the CapEx engine to start seeing a little bit better growth rates across your business Dave? David Farr : I think that I'll just take Bob's business first. I think there'll be a fairly positive impact pretty quickly for Bob just from a spending attitude standpoint. So I think that you would see a good business bounce in China. Bob has a lot of business in China, he is very strong there. So I think that way probably within a couple of months, I would say would bounce pretty quickly for him. The capital side, I think the CEOs would start, I would say within a quarter they start reevaluating. I think you start seeing some incremental spending starting to flow, a lot of work has been done, I mean, as you well know, Joe, we -- our book but not entered now our one but not numbers, how big Lal? Lal Karsanbhai : Over $1 billion. David Farr : Over $1 billion. So a lot of those projects are based around our China export type of market. And so I think that you would see some of those move pretty quickly. So I think that both Bob's and Lal's business would see a pretty good balance, we're obviously not assuming that right now because there is lot of uncertainty, but that would be one that would be the catalyst, as I said, that would create that second half recovery that would change us obviously to the plus two type of range and higher from that perspective, but I now be nice to see. In the meantime, we're focused on their cost. That's a good positive that would happen. The channel would move quickly as Bob said. Joe Ritchie : I guess, Dave, then in that context, right, you guys have said call it like a flat guide for the year, your order trends are maybe kind of slightly above that, I guess in what scenario do things kind of get worse from where we are today? David Farr : The scenario worse is that going back to my GFI numbers so that if this -- if we do not get an agreement with some improvement to get that, that tension out between the U.S. and China and it keeps grinding, I think you're going to see CEO's really continue to the curtail spending and that would drive obviously the GFI number down that would hurt us in the day-to-day spending. The other thing that would also that I'm really concerned about is the European economy does not see a recovery and the actions are trying to do with the new European leadership to try to get spending and investment going if this thing is still malaise in Europe that's a concern that we've built into that thing. So that's we -- we don't see the catalyst yet that being triggered. We know what they are, but we don't see them being triggered if you're right Joe and what you guys are talking about and that we do see some realistic change in the discussions between the U.S. and China, we do get some realistic movement coming in Europe. That will be two positive catalysts that would change the momentum of the curve and move it upwards and obviously move that thing from zero to a positive number in growing from there. But until we see that, I mean, I want my guys to focus on getting the cost down and if we get it down fast enough and this recovery happens, then obviously we'll make pretty good leverage. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That makes sense and maybe just one quick one for Bob. Bob and just thinking through the margin profile this quarter in your business, can you just kind of parse out what really drove the decrementals margins this quarter? What were kind of the key drivers among mixed pricing, what affected the business this quarter? Bob Sharp : Right. Price-cost was positive for us as it was in the second half, turned a lot through the year. The deleverage of the sales and then with that you get some plant issues around productivity and turnover and stuff when you don't have the growth to work off of gets compounded as part of it and then as Tim said, for mix, Resi versus Commercial and AC and cold chain, the transport and some of the more profitable retail was off against other things. And then on the Pro Tools and the disclosures in the tools area very high margin product. So it was -- a number of things kind of lined up in the wrong side of mix in the quarter in the. We don't -- we don't see that as any particular long-term trend or something like that, it's just sometimes the stars align and sometimes things work against us in this quarter was just bad -- things just did not line up well at all. Joe Ritchie : Got you. Thank you all. David Farr : Yes. Take care. Hope to see you soon. Operator : Next we have Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good afternoon, guys. David Farr : Good afternoon, Andrew. Andrew Kaplowitz : Dave, so when you look at Asia, Middle East, Africa Automation Solutions, the growth was 10% in Q4, which did accelerate versus Q3. You mentioned it briefly, but it does seem like it reaccelerated here, so what new markets are contributing to the reacceleration and is your confidence level increasing that China is still going to grow 5% to 8% or 6% to 8% in FY '20 in Automation Solutions. David Farr : I think that from our perspective we saw some, some very good international growth in late in the second half of the year, as it was really good to see. I think the opportunities in China are pretty still significant, as they continue to invest in technologies in areas that are allowing them to become more self-efficient. They are clearly investing in next generation digital technologies and so we're seeing that, that's a positive. So we had a very good year last year and the year before in China, and so I think that we still feel very confident we're going to see sales in the orders in this 5% to 10% range. So, I think we still see that, now going back to I think Joe's questions if we did get some kind of settlement and the relationships did improve, I think that will be a big positive to us, because of our presence in the quick investment opportunity, but we've got to see that, because it's just something, it's soured and we need to obviously fix that relationship. If you look at the Middle East, I think the Middle East has huge opportunities, what concerns me about the Middle East is primarily is the fact that the geopolitical the turmoil, the other actions that are going on there, I wouldn't call it war, but the skirmishes that are going on and so I'm very concerned about this period right now and that's why I'm probably more cautious than the average person relative to the Middle East, because I'm really concerned about all the activity under way in the Middle East and the concern that I have around, as that disrupt the projects and that standpoint. Now, the bookings would say not, but I am a little bit concerned, so I'm little bit cautious in those two marketplaces and the other one I would say is Latin America. We've had a good run, and the question is, does the whole Argentina thing, the Brazilian thing and the lack of money, does that stall saw as we go into 2020. So, Lal, why don't you give your view of that. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. Thanks, David. The China team did a phenomenal job serving what is for us a larger than building dollar market with very relevant customers who are willing and using our technology today and they want the latest and greatest technology, whether it's digital transformation, control systems, final controlled or instrument devices. So phenomenal job by the team to drive mid to low teens type of growth in China this year. And as David said, our expectation today given the environment is in that mid single-digit type of growth, 5 to 10 in that range would -- based on what we see in this space today. The only one I would add, David, I think you're right on, on the Middle East and Africa, I think Latin America is a concern right now given, the skirmishes and the unrest we have just basically across the continent. We had a phenomenal, a two-year run in Latin America and we're a little bit -- we're going to watch that one very carefully as we go forward. David Farr : Good. Thanks. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks for that guys. And then just staying with China actually in the Asian heating and cooling market, it does seem like the issues there for you guys have dragged on a bit longer than you expected. Is there a competitive issue there at all? And then you do a much easier comparisons coming up in Q1 as I remember correctly, China, heating, cooling fell off quite significantly in Q1 of this year? So would you expect Asian sales to shift now to positive growth despite continuing with the markets? Bob Sharp : Yes. It was improving. Like we said, it was down 30, actually in the first quarter last year and then it improved and getting pretty flat, but in Q4, it was down 9% again. So it's still been bouncing around a bit. We do have an easier comparison in Q1 October data point was solid. So you could see a scenario where China is positive in Q1. And again, the question is what kind of stability that has and keeps throughout the year is a little bit hard to tell right now. David Farr : I mean it has not been a competitive issue. I think Bob... Bob Sharp : Yes. Sorry, I missed that. David Farr : It's they don't have the money. Bob Sharp : The mix and from the standpoint of the driving right now with the commercial side of the business, it's frankly not Chinese competition. It's pretty specific competition that we know in quite in detail and we're doing well there, especially with some new 25 -- product layout and then our cold chain as well. So no, we don't see it as a competitive thing. Heating really fell away the heat pumps and stuff, there's still the green air policy and stuff like that, but I wouldn't say it was as actively being worked for a while, and as that funding and activity plays out, if that recovers, that's also a big part of the story. David Farr : I think if you think back for the people on the phone and Andrew, you talk about, I think there are a couple of big wildcard you guys -- it's China clearly -- China could be a very strong play for both businesses this year, it could be a dud, but it could be a very positive. If there is -- if favorable discussions happen between the two Presidents of the country, and we do come to some kind of terms of initial phase agreement that would create a positive mode, both in China and also in the U.S. for us. And so those are two wildcard that I see that had the biggest impact potential for us in the upside, as we look at the Company today and that's why we're trying to work as quickly as possible on the cost because if we get this thing gone, we can get that cost down, that'll be a nice bounce for us, but those are the two wild cards, you guys are focusing on pretty hard and the questions and I agree with you on both of them. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks guys. I appreciate it and Tim, appreciate all the help. David Farr : Okay. Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Next we have Robert McCarthy of Stephens. Robert McCarthy : Good afternoon, everyone. David Farr : Good afternoon, Rob. Robert McCarthy : Thanks again. David Farr : Did you ever get out of that taxi I saw in -- did you ever get out of that taxi? Robert McCarthy : Eventually. Yes. Eventually, I did. David Farr : You were banging the window and kept saying, help me, help me. Robert McCarthy : Absolutely. David Farr : You're from some place not from the East Coast, you can get confused. Robert McCarthy : Yes. I just wanted to honor the quiet period. That's all. You look like you were in a hurry and you're wearing the suit and got yourself shaving, I do not know, you were looking little nervous. David Farr : You got it. Robert McCarthy : All right. Okay. In any event, thanks Tim for everything. Really appreciate it. I think a couple of questions. First, if Bob wouldn't mind just talking a little bit longer-term about the HVAC markets from what he is seeing, clearly at a competitor conference this week, some admittedly smaller cap players have been talking about perhaps a flattening out of trends, particularly in housing or housing related consumer replacement like HVAC water heaters et cetera, where you could be seeing some pronounced weakness that could point to kind of end or pause in the echo boom of housing that we saw in late 2000 timeframe. I didn't know from what Bob seeing over the longer term and the installed base of what he deals with the players he serves, whether there is some concern that we could be seeing a longer-term secular step down and and what has been a very strong market over the past call it 10 years. Bob Sharp : Yes. I'd say, I think for 2020, our outlook on the U.S. market is quite modest and in the commercial probably a little bit of different dynamics within the residential and the commercial side, you see it now, I think I just saw that were for last week, the average person hanging on their health 13 years now, so they're not turning over as much which triggers a lot of the remodels, and 80 or so percent of the HVAC sales are on replacement as opposed to the new stuff. So on the housing starts has been lumbering along in the low-1's, and we don't really see anything different about that. On the replacement cycle.. David Farr : Yes. Let me give it. Bob, you know I've been involved in this business for longer than Bob has here. And I would say there are a couple of things going on. I think there is a fundamental flattening and one of my concerns is these guys have a deal in its issue, it's a cost of the new efficiency standards and the fact that people are now replace units or repair units versus replacement because to avoid the efficiencies change-ups in the price point of those units. So this trend has been going on for some time. I personally believe and as Bob's company structure thing, I think this is going to continue. And there's not going to unit growth, you're going to be price growth as a dollar value to growth, and that's what we're going to see as you guys go forward with your new replacement and that's what's going to happen here is to make technology value play because I think the cost of the new efficiency units, the refrigerants are going up and it drives down the underlying unit volume and that's what we did see for quite some time. And I think that's going to continue to your point. Bob Sharp : As we move into the next refrigerant standards for 2023 with the '18 of the mildly flammable that's going to also require some mitigating stuff on the systems, because of the flammability and they'll probably prolong some of the place or... David Farr : I think people are looking to replace and 20 years -- I think they're going to try to drive these units as long as possible. To your point, I think that's what's going to happen. I mean, between the refrigerants and efficiencies. I think people are going to drive a lot of the news, as long as possible and that's going to drive our unit. Therefore, you're going to make out and costing to make up and price points. Robert McCarthy : Okay. Now, thank you for that color. That's very helpful. I think the only other question I would have is just in terms of the free cash flow, I think, if my math is correct, which is often wrong, we're talking about $4 of free cash flow for next year and from that standpoint, what do you think you can drive it in the out-years and obviously given what's occurred in terms of the global economic environment and other issues, I don't think we need to talk about the target of 450 in earnings per se for fiscal '21, whether that's on or off the table, I think more importantly, what could we be expecting to see in the kind of that free cash flow number in the out years? What do you think it could compound that and maybe, and maybe just talking to the segment leaders, what can they can kind of tweak up or control, whether it's through the continued Final Control and Valves integration or other parts of the business to improve cash going forward, so that you think you can continue to compound here and a pretty higher rate because a key differentiator to the story is clearly your free cash flow conversion. David Farr : So I'm going to -- we're going to buy on the same because these are things that as we look at the profitability as we change in our capital mix, as we do the capital allocation, Rob as we look at the capital investments and the change in the structure of the Company that's going to have an altering to the free cash flow. So we'll make sure that we will cover that at the February meeting because that is one of our objectives can we -- we as a company has always been a very good cash flow generator. The question is, as we drive our margins as we rebase and we look at excess capital employed in the Company, we take that out, can we make that capital, our cash flow number even better. So I'm going to push on that until we finish our work here, because that's one of the outcomes of the work we're doing and that is clearly one of our objectives because we believe strongly cash will drive the value of our company and also allows us to give money back to our shareholders. Robert McCarthy : I'll leave it there. Thank you. David Farr : Thank you very much, Rob. All the best to you. Be safe. Operator : And next we have Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. David Farr : Hey Jeff. Are you in some place. Please tells you're in China, you're in Antarctica, where are you? Jeff Sprague : I mean the city that works, Stamford, Connecticut. David Farr : The city that taxes or did you work, I can't even say it's taxes or works -- go ahead. Go for it Jeff. Jeff Sprague : All right. Two things. So Dave, the $0.08 of EPS growth for for 2020 of the operational improvement that's effectively I guess on zero organic growth. Right? David Farr : Correct. Correct. Jeff Sprague : So implicitly that's restructuring savings, so that $0.08 is $65 million bucks or so is that carry over from 2019 actions you said earlier you have no benefit from Q1 in your guide, but it would seem like perhaps there is some restructuring coming through? David Farr : Yes. That means there is a couple of things going on there. It does the carryover for the second half, because we accelerated restructuring in the second half of the year, that's helping us in a big way and will see that from the incremental margins. Two, the price cost has definitely helped us in this scenario, a little bit better, more favorable from a price cost that's helping us. And we clearly look at the different type of mix and we had some tough mix of second half, so we're basically we always go back to normal mix, we don't plan on same top mix. So I think that those are three things but clearly a biggest chunk of that would be the restructuring benefits we got from the acceleration from June, July, August, September and I would say that's the biggest benefit. And then when we flow out the restructure in the first quarter, we'll tell you what that number is, we'll start laying out the benefits and you'll start seeing those incremental benefits come forward in the second half of 2020. Jeff Sprague : But what should we expect Dave, you haven't put them in your guide, but there should be some payback from that $70 million and... David Farr : Yes. There is going to be -- Yes. There will be some payback and I mean I don't think it's going to dollar for dollar because it's -- because we are not going full year, but I would say at least $0.50 per dollar would be estimate right now in this year. Jeff Sprague : And then, just thinking -- right in this year. And then just thinking about what we might hear in February. So it sounds like you have full Board approval for this restructuring right you -- you know what you need to do. You're going to do $70 million in the first quarter, that's, call it 30% of a grand total of $250 million or so. So you're coming out of the gate with apparently Board approval and company buy in on the whole restructuring so putting aside kind of portfolio questions, I mean, is there some further deeper discussion on cost or other metrics or regardless of the portfolio changes or not, this is -- this is the restructuring number? David Farr : So I do not have full Board approval yet on everything we're trying to do what I told the Board is that we are still working, the broad plans at each of the businesses are that first passes. I also have some initial work looking at from the corporate standpoint and what we can do at the corporate, but it's not done yet. So what we -- what I told the Board is there is $70 million of activity, we can do pretty quickly this quarter and I want to get on with it and they need a trust me as a longtime CEO as a leader of this company that we are not doing things that are damaging the Company, going back to what the earlier question. So I do not have full Board approval on the total plan, but what I push these guys pretty hard is what can we get done in the first couple of months of this year to really gives us some headroom and some flexibility if things get sloppy. And so that's what the $70 million is and you're right, I push pretty hard, but the Board does trust me that I'm not going to do some stupid and then they'll see the whole review of all the plans as we go forward here. So they have not approved it, they is allowed me to take a big jump and jump on the first start here based on my credibility and leadership of running Emerson for the last 19 plus years. So that's what it looks like Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Yes. So that makes sense. And so that would then mean that if you do the -- the full $250 million or $300 million, there is a heavier structural lift that these actions would clearly carry into 2021, you would not be able to get all that stuff, started in 2020. David Farr : What the stuff I'm doing -- the stuff up front right now are very quick. These are very quick actions both Bob, Lal, and we are corporate doing. So the stuff that we're trying to do right now, it will be quicker and faster payback and the really structural things will take longer in the second half of the year and more into '21. So you saw what I -- what I ask the guys is find me the things that we could get on to very quickly that we -- that make a lot of sense from that we would do normally, but let's go as quickly as possible and it gives me some time to deal with the longer structural issues and how we go about looking at that. We want to prove -- I want the Board approval on those things. And so I think that's how we're looking at it for the first 3, 4, 5 months, I'm looking at quick things we can do by going after on the quick cost structures, which don't really take a lot of of a Board approval process from the standpoint of going forward. So that's what we're look at. I'm trying to get things quicker that give us a little headroom, from the standpoint of what's going on in the economy. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks for the color and good luck. David Farr : All the best to you. Thank you very much, Jeff. Operator : Next we have Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. David Farr : Hi, Josh, you're going to be my last guy here and I apologize everybody else, but you know I have the longer questions, I have more people on the phone today, so I apologize that I will work very, very hard to get the rest of people next time or working around, but we've been already past an hour and 20 minutes. So, but I want Josh, you got your three questions. Take your time. Your closing it . You're staying between all of us from getting a drink. Don't screw it up now. Come on. Josh Pokrzywinski : Well, I'd have more time if Rob McCarthy wasn't such a storyteller, but we'll If you say anyway. Just on the restructuring, if you could kind of help us with maybe the framework that you're adopting or as you're bring in some of these external folks to work -- to look at the organization, is it more kind of looking at some of the structural costs, things like G&A, where maybe there duplicate functions or is it more on trying to benchmark businesses to say like Final Control could take it to the next level, we can compare that to a competitor or something like that. Is there a specific track that this is going down or is it a little bit of all the above? David Farr : It's more of we're looking at G&A expenses that may be that we don't need to do and we have duplication. We're looking at things that both the two businesses do and the corporate do are the things that we do from a frequency standpoint and in the process, we're sort of overdoing them and maybe we're spending a little bit more money, as we shrunk the Company into two platforms and we trade off back and forth, where could we go after from a G&A standpoint. The structure stuff that we're working on very much is around the structure between the individual businesses, our facilities and maybe where we have too much capacity to make facilities or maybe where we have too much overlap from an organization standpoint, we may want to put organizations together. So we're looking at more of a structural from that perspective. And then we're looking at the cost structures in between all the G&As benchmarking, what we do as a company and what other companies do. And we make sure that we are -- we consider ourselves best in class. But are we doing things too much and can we look at cost, we can take out. I mean, fundamentally we run very high levels of profitability as I pointed out, but I think we can run higher levels of profitability and how do we make sure we do that without jeopardizing the control and the discipline, our planning process in the credit billion and that we have as a company. So, those are things we're looking at, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then shifting over to the demand side. And Dave, the last time we had a slowdown, you had a big set of customers in oil and gas to kind of learn capital discipline for the first time. So maybe there are levers that got pulled that wouldn't get pulled again, how would you compare some of the decisions are customers are making around timing are curtailing spending and kind of how rational those seem in the current environment or how sustainable some of those decisions are? David Farr : Well, first, Josh, this cycle just barely got started and I don't think there has been any level of excess spending or capital that we've seen. From my perspective, I think they've been very rational, what they're doing right now is they're spending more money on short-term paybacks, you saw the KOB 3 to KOB 2. So I think there's a lot more discipline within this segment, I'll let Lal talk here in a second. But I think it's a better process for us and if they get some clarity around what's going to happen in China, some clarity what the -- let's say the trade discussions are going to be, I think you'll see some of that capital flow out and I know they have pressures on them relative to their capital allocation, but I also think they have the capital flexibility to invest for the future and so I think the disciplined standpoint has been much better here in the last 2 or 3 years and this cycle has been truncated and pushed down and I think it could pop back up in a nice way. So, Lal, anything you want to add there? Lal Karsanbhai : No. I think that's well said David. The discipline around the capital is there, the discipline around the operational dollars there as well. But ultimately the plants have to run safely, the fuels have to run safely, and there is a degree of investment that goes along with that and $118 billion type of installed base that we do have leads us to gain -- continue to gain customer relevance and trust as we go through the slower periods of time. David Farr : I want to thank everybody. Tim is not going to go away. He'll be still with us. I think he'll still be with us in early February. He may be in a transition mode, but he is not going anywhere anytime soon. So, you guys at least have a chance to be nice to him one more time. I wouldn't overdo it, but I appreciate everyone's -- I appreciate everyone's patience and I also want to thank all my shareholders and the sell side analysts for giving me the time to talk about issues what's going on, what you think about the Company and what the Board should be thinking about those are very, very important inputs to us and the Board truly appreciate them, and they were summarized by Tim, Mark, and myself and they got them, and they read them. And I want to thank everybody and I will look forward to seeing you guys real soon. Thank you. Bye. Operator : And we thank you sir also and to the rest of the management team for your time today. Again, the conference call is now concluded. At this time, you may disconnect your lines. Thank you again everyone. Take care and have a great day.",

This conference is being recorded today, February 4, 2020. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Pete Lilly, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead. Pete Lilly : Thank you so much, and welcome, everyone, to Emerson's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Train, President; and of course, Tim Reeves, Director of Investor Relations, Emeritus. Timothy Reeves : Emeritus. I graduated. Pete Lilly : I encourage you all to follow along in the slide presentation, which is available on our website. I'll start on Slide 4 with the results of the quarter. Underlying sales growth came in slightly below expectations, flat year-over-year, driven by softness in global discrete markets and North American upstream oil and gas activity. Despite lower sales, operations executed well to deliver adjusted EPS of $0.67, spot on the guidance we've provided in the fourth quarter call. Automation Solutions underlying was up 1%, which was somewhat below management's expectations, primarily due to the aforementioned U.S. discrete and upstream market softness. Demand in other global process and hybrid markets remained stable. Importantly, we also saw several large LNG projects booked in the quarter after delays from the second half of the year -- of the last year. Commercial & Residential Solutions was in line with expectations, down 1%, reflecting continued softness in global professional tools and cold chain markets, somewhat offset by stronger markets in Europe and Asia, Middle East, and Africa.  The company initiated $97 million of restructuring actions in the quarter, well above the $70 million discussed on last quarter's call. These actions, combined with incremental actions from the second half of last year are expected to drive improved profitability in 2020. Cash flow performance was solid in the quarter with free cash flow, up significantly versus prior year, reflecting 94% conversion of net income. Turning to Slide 5. We'll review the P&L. First quarter gross margin was roughly flat at 42.4% as favorable price/cost was offset by unfavorable business and regional mix, primarily due to lower U.S. shale and highly profitable upstream and discrete markets. SG&A as a percent of sales increased 110 basis points to 27.1%. However, this includes 150 basis points of unfavorable impact from higher stock compensation due to a higher stock price.  Adjusted EBIT and EBITDA margins, which exclude restructuring and related costs, declined 180 basis points and 170 basis points, respectively. Importantly, these changes include 220 basis points of combined unfavorable impact from stock compensation, pension, and FX losses. Excluding these impacts, adjusted EBIT and EBITDA margins were up 40 and 50 basis points respectively, reflecting strong read-through of prior year restructuring actions.  Turning to Slide 6. From a geographic perspective, we saw mixed underlying sales results in Q1. The Americas were down below expectations due to weak U.S. upstream oil and gas and discrete end markets. The United States and Canada were down 3% and 1%, respectively; and Latin America, up 4%. Europe was down slightly with 2% growth in Western Europe offset by sluggishness in Eastern Europe. Asia, Middle East, and Africa was up 6%, led by China up 6% and strong growth in the Middle East.  Turning now to Slide 7. Total segment adjusted EBIT margin dropped 40 basis points to 15.4%, reflecting the negative impacts of foreign transaction losses as well as unfavorable business and regional mix. These items totaled 80 basis points unfavorable impact. As previously mentioned, stock compensation costs increased due to a higher stock price, and pension costs increased due to lower discount rates. Corporate and other costs, excluding restructuring and related costs, was favorable. Q1 cash flow performance was solid. Operating cash flow increased by over 30% to $424 million, and free cash flow of $310 million represented 94% conversion. Turning to Slide 8. We will bridge first quarter EPS. Tax, stock compensation, pension, and foreign exchange transactions totaled $0.13 headwind for the quarter, which was in line with guidance. Operations, share repurchases and lower interest costs delivered $0.05, also in line with guidance to net $0.67 of EPS on an adjusted basis. In summary, operations and balance sheet delivered our target EPS contribution on lower-than-expected sales. We will now review business platforms, turning to Slide 10. Automation Solutions underlying sales came in somewhat below expectations at 1% growth for the quarter. December trailing 3-month underlying orders were up 2%, driven by several large LNG bookings that had been delayed from the second half of last year. Of note, backlog grew by 7% to nearly $5 billion on a sequential basis compared to last quarter. The Americas underlying sales were down 1% as discrete and upstream markets continued to soften. Europe sales were also down 1% as low-single-digit growth in Western Europe was more than offset by weakness in Eastern Europe. Asia, Middle East, and Africa grew 6% led by China and the Middle East. Our long-cycle businesses continued steady growth with both Systems and Final Control, up mid-single digits. Adjusted EBITDA margin was down 60 basis points, reflecting 50 basis points unfavorable impact of FX transaction losses as well as unfavorable mix resulting from the year-over-year decline in the more profitable North American upstream and discrete markets. Excluding these impacts, the business delivered improved adjusted segment EBITDA margins on lower-than-expected sales, reflecting the benefit of 2019 restructuring actions. In the quarter, restructuring actions totaled $83 million across the platform. These actions, together with approximately $30 million of incremental actions in the second half of 2019, are expected to support improved adjusted segment margins on flat to slightly positive underlying sales for the year. Now turning to Slide 11. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales were down 1%. December trailing 3-month underlying orders were also down 1%. The Americas underlying sales were down 3% as North American residential HVAC markets remained soft, and slower industrial markets weighed on professional tools and cold chain demand. Latin America grew by 6%. Asia, Middle East, and Africa grew 5% with mid-single-digit growth across China, the rest of Asia, and the Middle East. Commercial & Residential Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin increased 90 basis points, primarily reflecting favorable price cost and the benefit of prior year restructuring actions. For the quarter, restructuring actions totaled $10 million. Combined with approximately $5 million of incremental actions from the second half of 2019, we expect improved profitability for the year on slightly negative underlying sales. Turning to Slide 13, we'll cover the updated guidance. Despite some progress toward trade resolution, we continue to expect geopolitical tensions, pending elections, and corporate focus on cost-cutting to drive a no -- a low to no growth environment in 2020. On the full year, there is no change to our expectations for underlying sales. Of note, this outlook does not include any potential impacts from the unfolding coronavirus, which will be discussed later in the call. As highlighted on the last call, Emerson has managed multiple economic slowdowns in our history. And in the current environment, we have shifted our management investment focus from a growth mindset to a cost mindset. We initiated this process last year, increasing restructuring investments $35 million in the second half of 2019. Today, we announced the next phase of that plan. For fiscal year 2020, we expect total restructuring spend to be approximately $215 million, of which $175 million will happen within the Automation Solutions platform. Commercial & Residential Solutions and Corporate will each take $35 million and $5 million of actions, respectively. Of note, during our upcoming investor conference, we expect to present an additional detail of the outcome of the Board's review announced on October 1 as well as update the longer-term guidance framework beyond 2020. We now expect adjusted EPS in the range of $3.55 to $3.80, an increase of $0.07 at the midpoint, reflecting the benefit of 2020 cost actions. We expect minimal net cash impact from restructuring actions. Operating cash flow is now expected to be $3.15 billion, and CapEx spending has increased to $650 million, leaving our free cash flow target unchanged at $2.5 billion. Please turn to Slide 14. This slide bridges our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance. The starting point for the bridge is 2019 GAAP EPS of $3.71. Walking across to the right, we have adjusted 2019 EPS of $3.69, which excludes $0.14 of favorable discrete tax items and adds back $0.12 of restructuring charges. Continuing from $3.69, we expect a total of $0.26 of headwind this year for tax, FX, stock comp and pension. Largely offsetting these headwinds, we now expect $0.15 of operational improvement on flat to slightly down sales, up from $0.08 discussed in our prior guidance, reflecting the benefit of 2020 restructuring actions. We also expect $0.09 of EPS from improved debt cost structure and a strong balance sheet with $1.5 billion of planned share repurchases. This gets us to a full year adjusted EPS midpoint of $3.67. Please turn to Slide 15. This slide lays out our second quarter 2020 guidance. The underlying sales outlook for the quarter is flat, reflecting continued headwinds in North American upstream and global discrete markets. Note that this outlook does not include any potential impact of the coronavirus. Despite continued North America mix headwinds, we expect total segment adjusted EBIT margin up 20 basis points and EBITDA margin up 60 basis points, driven by the benefit of prior year restructuring actions. We expect adjusted EPS of $0.81, which excludes $50 million of planned restructuring actions in the quarter. Please turn to Slide 16. This slide lays out the first and second half adjusted EBITDA margin progression for our business, assuming the midpoint of their respective underlying sales guidance. We expect first half restructuring spend totaling approximately $145 million across both platforms. These investments, together with easing mix headwinds and favorable price cost, drive significant margin improvement in the second half, with Automation Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin up approximately 150 basis points and Commercial & Residential Solutions up approximately 100 basis points. We plan to exit 2020 with an improved cost structure that yields stronger earnings and cash as we go forward, and we look forward to laying out our long-term plans at the investor conference on February 13.  And now please turn to Slide 18. And with that, I will turn the call over to Mr. David Farr. David Farr : Thank you very much. I want to welcome all the Emerson investors this afternoon and the analysts that follow Emerson in our markets we serve as we discuss our first quarter results and what we expect for the full year. I also want to thank all the Emerson leaders around the world and for all the Emerson employees that make this -- made this quarter happen and are implementing the total aggressive cost resetting programs to make Emerson stronger, more competitive as we deal with this challenging and uncertain global industrial and commercial markets. Thank you very much for your efforts. As you can see for the first quarter press release, it's been a busy, busy first quarter executing around our 2.5-year cost resetting efforts. As you know, we accelerated the fourth quarter cost resetting by about $35 million. That money and those savings are flowed into this year, built into the plan originally and from a savings dollar for dollar, maybe a little bit more than a dollar per dollar based on the -- it was a headcount reduction program. In the first quarter, we did $97 million. Part of that includes corporate, where we took down the Emerson plane fleet to 5, and we sold the helicopter. We are expecting, for the total year, around $215 million of restructuring. And in total, you'll see next week well over $420 million, $425 million of cost reductions during this time period, over this 2.5 year time period, with savings well north of $425 million. And we're expecting incremental savings on the first quarter restructurings around $50 million. The big issue now is we're starting to attack and go after the access facilities and the higher cost structures will pay back more in '21 and '22. But we're going to continue to drive -- and you could see well into the second half this year and well into 2021. We will have over dollar for dollar savings when it's all said and done, and the execution is going pretty well at this point in time. I'm pleased with it. We reviewed with it at great detail yesterday with the Board. Well more than 3.5 hours of details with the Board as they understood what we're doing to make sure we're taking permanent cost actions, permanent cost setting and not damaging the core quality of investments, the technology and the customer service support that we have out there, not damage the long-term viability and franchise businesses that we have at Emerson. As you know, we have our annual investors conference next week in New York City on February 13. It's going to be -- not be on Valentine's Day. It's unusual for me. So you guys get -- make sure you do everything special for your spouse that evening, but we're going to be doing our call -- our investors conference in the morning.  Details around the global cost resetting to drive the new peak margins, where we laid out very detailed with a lot of growth -- the very little growth environment. You'll see what we're trying to undertake and how we're trying to do it, the timing, the annual savings when they're flowing in, when we're going to reach those margins from an EBIT basis, in an EBITDA basis. At the same time, we're taking very significant actions around the corporate headquarter structure not only here in St. Louis but around the world as we look at best ways to optimize our cost structure, looking between the Automation Solutions and the Commercial & Residential. This is driven internally by the key leaders, the business leaders and the corporate leaders, but also with the support of McKinsey as we looked at how we could optimize Emerson's efficiency, effectiveness and profitability to drive record levels of margins by each of the major business units. Lal, Bob and I will put more color on this next Thursday, but we have very good progress. As you can see, in the second half of this year, Automation Solutions margins are starting to pop up. Bob took after this last year, Bob and his team, Bob Sharp, and they're already seeing improvement in the underlying profitability of the businesses. So the actions are taking hold, and they're doing a good job, and we'll talk a lot more about that as we go forward. But as the global Emerson employees know and know full well, we are fast in the execution mode right now. And we cannot depend on the fact that there's no growth out there. We are figuring out how to grow our profitability, how to grow our earnings and grow our cash flow in a no growth, low growth or maybe a negative growth environment. I'm ignoring the coronavirus right now. Both Mike Train and I will talk a little bit about this and what we see at this point in time. But it's definitely, definitely going to have an impact in the near term, medium term, and potentially, long term as we look at this.  As you could see, our total orders are trending in the plus 2, minus 2 range right now, trending right now towards the 0 as we look at the current month in the current quarter. It tells me that we are trending very tightly in the range that we've laid out for underlying sales. We continue to look for those catalysts that drive up in North America and other markets of the world. But as I look at the world order pace, I look at the sales pace right now, North America is weak, weaker than we thought. Western Europe is about in line, 2% to 3%. Eastern Europe's down, primarily driven by Russia and Turkey. The Middle East and Africa, which we were just in, was -- is doing better, and several large projects are happening underway. In Asia Pacific, as of the middle of January, was trending pretty well and had pretty good growth in the first quarter, and we still look at pretty good growth for the full year there. My concern as I look at the next couple of quarters is, I don't see the catalyst that drive the fundamental pick back up in the U.S. at this point in time. I don't see Canada, nor have I seen Mexico and other parts of Latin America. What we're trying to do right now is control our destiny through our costs and cost resetting to figure out how to drive better earnings and cash flow through this cost reset. If growth comes and we get it, so be it, but we're going to have to fight, I believe, all year long for incremental pockets of growth and things are continuing to happen to us. As you could see, the global markets are not easy at this time. They're definitely not easy. I do see opportunities for growth out there. But I don't see how and when we will get to those levels at this point in time. I know people believe there will be a stronger second half. But from my standpoint, right now, I'm not betting on that. This company is betting on very low growth, moderate growth or no growth, and we're driving the actions necessary around that.  Operating cash flow will be good. You saw the first quarter. We had very good operating cash flow for the first quarter. Some of that was trapped, in my opinion, working capital on the balance sheet. We also had some cash flow based on taxes. Frank had done some restructuring, Frank and his team, restructuring taxes that flowed through in that first quarter. That should continue to help us as we go into the first half of this year.  Overall, I think our cash flow is going to be up nicely in the $3.15 billion to $3.2 billion. Right now, as we reviewed with the Board, and how we see this, assuming no significant acquisitions, we're going to pay back $1.2 billion in dividends. We're working on our 64th year of increased dividends. Our dividend ratio, as you look at free cash flow, is dropping down below 50. Our share repurchase somewhere around 1.5, assuming no significant acquisitions at this point in time. So close to 85% of our cash flow should be repaid back to shareholders in support of what we're trying to do with our shareholders.  Again, if we have the opportunities for acquisitions, we'll take them. We're also assuming higher capital spending this year. We've raised capital spending up to that $650 million range, $650 million range, in support of the actions we're taking as we build new best cost locations around the world, as we've continued to reset our facility structure and our cost structure. Our acquisition funnel right now is pretty small. People are very nervous about selling assets at this point in time with the uncertainty around the cycle now with China situation. We have, in the process, we're in the process right now of closing 2 nice little bolt-on acquisitions worth about $120 million of sales -- or not sales, $125 million of value purchase price, both -- one in Automation Solutions, one in Commercial Residential Solutions, both in the control element part of the pyramid that we always talk about.  While Mike and I are joined -- and we're going to tag team a little bit on China, give you some insights to this. Let me give a brief overview. I'm going to turn over to Mike, and we'll go back and forth here.  The China situation first, I want to say something to all my employees. We have 11,000 employees here. We are in constant touch with them. We have the ability to communicate to 80,000 of our employees on an ongoing basis, every minute, every day. Our hearts are going out with all the people that are locked up in their apartments right now. Fortunately, we are all safe at this point in time. But clearly, they're in their apartments. They're working, communicating, obviously, by phone, by e-mail, as they try to figure out how do we get ready to get going as we come out of this? But our thoughts are with them at this point in time, and it's a concern that we have relative to all our employees, not only there, but also around the world.  As I look at this right now, it will be a negative impact, and I'll let Mike go through some points here. But from my perspective, assuming that they do allow us to start manufacturing again, and we started, you can see in the supply chain, again, on February 10, I still believe we'll have somewhere between $50 million and $100 million of sales impact.  Now folks I'm giving you my feel for knowing China and my feel for what I think is going to happen. If this extends, that number will go up, but I'm just giving you my feel. As I look at the sourcing situation we'll show you, I am concerned about the start-up of this, and Mike will give you some numbers around that. I'm concerned about the customers and how fast they'll come back up in lot. We also have a lot of our customers that do a lot of manufacturing and shipping out of there, and we have components here and there, and I'm concerned about some of that work going on. My perspective is, as I look at the number of $50 million to $100 million right now, some of that will be permanently lost, depending on Bob Sharp's business and the heating system marketplace. Once the heating system is gone, you're going to wait for the next year.  I firmly believe that Automation Solutions, assuming this doesn't go too long, should make it up before the fiscal year is done or within the calendar year. But again, what I'm looking at right now is the feel that we have based on how long we're going to be shut down and our sort of estimate of how quick this thing will start up. So Mike, why don't you give them a couple of facts, and we'll go back and forth and talk a little bit more? Michael Train : All right. Great. David, great to be with everybody this afternoon. Thank you very much. First of all, I also want to share my thanks to our China team, our 11,000 employees. We recently celebrated our 40th anniversary in China. Today, we have a terrific business in China, nearly $2 billion in size, and again, almost 11,000 employees. And we had a solid Q1 in both platforms in that mid-single digits that Pete talked to.  Secondly, January 15, we saw the signing of the U.S.-China trade deal, which was pretty important. That Phase 1 deal is pretty important to us. I think it also -- there were announcements on both sides, which would be Phase 2 discussions commencing shortly. We're excited by that. It's going to take some time, but we're excited about that. So I wanted to highlight that. But just about that, that same time is when people were recognizing that we have this coronavirus issue. Our employees went out on January 24 for their Chinese New Year holiday. They've been out now for 11 or 12 days. And currently, under the government regulations and guidance, we intend to start -- restart our facilities next Monday, on February 10.  But we need to make sure that happens. And we'll be watching that. And I think we can report on that a little bit next week... David Farr : Yes, we can. Michael Train : I think some of the issues that we're going to face are going to be around as you restart these facilities. Obviously, we're going to have to manage our facilities. We have the temperature monitoring. We have travel restrictions. We're doing everything we need to manage. But our supply chain, I think, will be suffering that -- despite best efforts. It's just going to be a rocky start. The logistics, the supply chain, sub-suppliers and all those kinds of things. So... David Farr : How much do we have in our supply chain right now, both for China, Mike? Michael Train : So our supply chain in China's about $750 million. $500 million stays in China, $250 million actually goes out to the global business. So have impacts in China, we'll have impacts beyond China, in terms of that.  And again, as you were highlight, we have several global customers that use China to build their projects, their modules, that kind of thing. And we're going to see some impacts there that would impact business in other regions beyond China as well.  So we're starting off with kind of the view of what's going to happen here. I think next week will be a big important week. We'll learn some more things as we go forward. And then maybe we could comment. Again, there's no saying what's going to happen there. David Farr : We'll do that. Thanks. Thank you, Mike. As I look at this, I referred to the Board yesterday and today, for the people -- I'm aging myself here, the Apollo space programs, in the 5 or 6 minutes, we have their reentry blackouts. We are in that reentry blackout period for China right now. We do not know what we don't know at this point in time. But clearly, the organization for China, who I know are listening on this phone or will be listening on this phone when they get -- wake up, are doing everything they possibly can to get ready right now.  I just know that the supply chain, the uncertainty, logistics, all these different things, there's a lot of moving parts, the sub-supply chains, the feeders to our supply chain, there's a lot of components here. So for people not to think that it would not be a negative short term, I don't think they're thinking straight. It will be a negative. It will be a negative for the global economy. It will be, potentially, bigger, if it doesn't get started. This thing drags on long time. But right now, our feeling is right, it's not going to drag on. But we're just getting ready for it, and we're trying to get -- we're planning everything around this, so we can execute and make sure they have the resources they need to get the job done.  They're all geared up to come back to work. We'll give you an update on the 14th as we look at -- on the 13th, I'm sorry, as we look at what happens at 10th, 11th and 12th because we'll get a good feel for this. My gut tells me, it will be a slow recovery, and they'll get their act together and things will happen. But again, we are in that Apollo space program reentry, 5 to 6 minutes, where no one knows what's going on. And when I talk to you on the 13th, you'll give me, \"Houston, we're live.\" and we'll talk about that.  So again, that's how we see at this point in time. I don't want to scare people. But it's the facts. We do a very major business in China. We're very strong in China. We have a good sense of China. I have -- Mike and I both managed and worked in China for many years together as a team, and we spent a lot of time there. And we're supporting our employees, we're supporting the government, we're supporting our government as we try to work through this. But that's where we sit at this point in time. And we'll keep you informed.  So I want to thank all the employees. I want to thank the Board's engagement. And I also want to thank the shareholders engagements that I've been having in the last several months, and I will continue to have with our shareholders. With that, we'll open the lines and we'll take some Q&A to see if we can get some clarity around the concerns and questions people have out there. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. John Walsh : So thank you for all that color around China. I guess, just maybe a point of clarification, you kind of detailed what you think the impact could be, but then I guess going through the prepared remarks and looking at the release, you have some comments that the guidance excludes any impact from the coronavirus? David Farr : Correct. Correct. John Walsh : Just trying to -- so how do we kind of sensitize that? Is it in the plus the $0.02 minus that you call around next quarter or would it actually be greater than or lower than...? David Farr : I would say it's in the plus or minus $0.02 right now in that quarter, John, to be honest. Now, we're assuming that we're going to have starting up in the 10th, February 10, and we have a slow ramp. So I see some potential impact to the year at $50 million to $100 million, that plus or minus $0.02, I would say, covers that right now based on what we're seeing on slow start.  Now if we're sitting there in New York next week and I'm saying, \"Hey, this thing is really grinding and having a hard time both with our customer standpoint and also our supply chain standpoint, we'll have to reconfigure that.\" But right now, that's how we have this factored into play, that plus or minus $0.02. You're exactly right. John Walsh : Okay. Great. And then just thinking about the margins for the quarter in Automation Solutions, you called out a couple of things in the prepared remarks. I'm just -- as I'm looking at mix for the balance of the year, thinking about North America, about discrete, about maybe some OE greater than aftermarket at some point here. How are you thinking about the cadence of seeing mix be, I guess, maybe less negative as we go through the year? Or how are you thinking about that? David Farr : So we are -- what we would like to see happen in the cadence of the year, obviously, the first quarter flow. North America was really very negative for us. The discrete business is very negative for us relative to our discrete around the world, so very high profit business, both of those. So the cadence will be expect -- I think we're going to continue to see strong KOB 3, which does help us. I think our cadence is that we see some stability within the oil and gas market space in North America, not growing, but stabilizing. So as we look at the channels, as we look at our customer base, we'll see some improvement in the flow and discrete business, which will help us a little bit on the margin pressure. And then the rest of the help is going to come from all the restructuring. But you called it right, the flow in discrete right now in North America is a very challenging issue for us. It was very difficult in the last two quarters. And as we look at this right now, our plan is we see some stability, some improvement, which will help put a little margin win to our back as we get into that second half, and that's where we see it right now. And obviously, you'll be able to tell on our order releases and our comments, basically, how we're seeing it. If you start seeing us say, \"Hey, things have stabilized. Things have improved.\" You'll know, John, that we're seeing a little bit better improvement around that flow business, which is very important to us. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz at Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : So, I know you don't want to give us too much color or more color around the $425 million program before the Analyst Day. But as your Board and the consultants reviewed your cost, that opportunity from, what it looks like in FY '20 for the initial $215 million? It looks like the majority is focused on AS versus C&RS or Corporate. So when all said and done, how much confidence does the program give you to get AS margin back up to the 19% margin that you've previously talked about? David Farr : Yes. So I mean, my confidence level and the Board; as I said, the Board spent 3.5 hours on these actions. We're talking about the Board confidence, my confidence is extremely high at this point in time, extremely. We are taking serious actions. Bob's business started, you well know, Bob's on his sixth quarter of negative sales. Bob started his cost out 7 quarters ago. So if you look back at his major restructuring, it actually started in late '18 throughout 2019. So what he's working on right now are actions around fixed facilities to try to take some fixed facilities offline and consolidate. So his are a little bit different. That's why you haven't seen a lot with Bob right now, his business over the next couple of years, and he'll be doing a fixed savings, and he's starting to get that.  I feel very, very confident. Now I'm involved in reviewing the work with Lal and Ram, the Board and I looked at in detail, and we look at the costs, I feel very good about those savings. I feel very good about the bridge chart that we're showing you from the second half. I think the question -- the previous caller, John, asked is very relevant relative to that mix issue, which needed stability. But as I look at the actions, they're doing right now in the short term, because it's very much people oriented and then we're starting to take some of the longer-term facilities, so I feel very confident we'll start seeing that margin move up in the second half. Anything you want to add to that, Frank? Frank Dellaquila : Yes. I think we've got a good plan going forward. We're looking for a significant margin improvement in the second half. And a lot of it does depend on the pace of business in the mix. The restructuring actions will kick in, and we're pretty confident in the margin development as we go through the year. David Farr : And McKinsey reported to the Board yesterday in the work that we did between the two business units and Corporate, and we have additional actions that we can deal with probably starting in another couple of years. We want some backup stuff and some other opportunity, but let's put it this way, our hands are pretty -- our plate's pretty full right now with actions we've got going on. And -- but we're going to study and lay them out and see how we can start flowing some or maybe later this year, early next year to give us some protection in case -- I'm not supposed to swear, but I'm going to swear, \"Oh, [indiscernible] happened.\"  But from my perspective, we're trying to cover that. McKinsey did a good job explaining how we're protecting what makes Emerson unique, our franchises and the corporation culture, but at the same time, look how we could be more efficient and more effective. It was a very good discussion around from the Board perspective as they pulled back the sheets. Andrew Kaplowitz : And then you mentioned when you released December orders that they did display some signs of picking up in AS, really in LNG. You said that again today, AS backlog increased 7% sequentially. So did you see a bit of an uptick in project releases by customers? Do you think they become more cautious again as the coronavirus continues to spread?  And maybe stepping back, it's been a little while since you updated us on the large project funnel, do you still have $1 billion of projects that you've been told you've won but haven't booked? And is your project funnel improving, decreasing or roughly stable? David Farr : So I mean, you've hit a nail in the head here. The issue right now, I think the North America projects we're starting to see release, I'm very worried as I'm sure my customers are worried about because a lot of that business is going to be shipped -- production will be shipped to China. And so my concern is if this coronavirus goes longer, it could delay those projects, and it could slow down some of the projects we think that should be released here in the next couple of months.  So the coronavirus has an impact on many, many things relative to our business base. So therefore, that's why we are still convinced that the second half could be a challenge for us, and that's how we're banking at that 0 growth because of things like that. Now the projects we see releasing, and I still believe will release, are the Middle East and India. Those projects are separate from the work been going on in China. But I would say the Middle East, Mike, you and I were just there. China, I mean, the India projects. So I feel good about those. And I think that will help us as we fill up that pipeline for the second half of the year and then as we move into 2021. But we've got to get some settlements, some resolution on the corona. We've got to get some traveling. And if we don't, then that's going to clearly slow down some of the North America projects. Operator : The next question is from Gautam Khanna at Cowen and Company. Gautam Khanna : Yes. I was just curious, what is your expectation this year for KOB 1 as a percentage of Automation Solutions revenue? David Farr : Okay. I'm rubbing my rally monkey's head here a little bit, Gautam. So I can see if -- okay. So I'll give you my feeling right now, okay? I think we're going to be around 25% for KOB 1. I think we will be 57% -- 57%, 58% for KOB 3, and so what's that mean for the -- 18% for KOB 2. That's where I think we're going to be right now. And I don't have any crystal ball more than you, but that's where I see -- I look at the pipelines, I look at the things we're talking about right now. We are -- we shared with the Board we're not backing off any of the KOB 3 investments. We have the organization highly motivated to try to take some market share on installed base. We're focusing other things that cut our costs around. But that area right now is ripe for us to continue to take share. And we want to build that KOB 3 up strongly because those projects will start flowing, and it'll help us offset the margin dilution from the projects. Gautam Khanna : Got it. And not to steal thunder from next week, but how far out do you anticipate providing long-term financial targets? This is a fiscal '22? Or what are you thinking? Like how long are you right now projecting? David Farr : I think we're going '23. We're going to go '23. We will bridge -- we will bridge the $450 million. And what we see -- I mean, as you know, I try to be honest and transparent, sort of like the Iowa caucus. I will try to bridge for the 2021 numbers. These guys are all -- they can't handle this -- they can't handle the truth. They could not be in any movies like me. But they -- we'll bridge that, so you can see what -- the $450 million we talked about, and then we'll talk about what we see going on going forward. You're going to see a much lower sales forecast as we manage the growth to keep it -- we're focusing on the cost and until I see some really strength in what's going to happen to underlying growth, we're going to keep that growth rate down and manage around costs. So we'll give you that bridge. But think '23, but also -- I'll tell you what I think about '21 and what we told you last year. I always try to bridge what I committed to. Operator : The next question is from John Inch at Gordon Haskett. John Inch : Okay. So I just want to be clear. So the $215 million of restructuring, the $95 million that we did last year, Dave, you talked about reviewing this with the Board. Does this mean on the 13th when you talk about the Board's review or you present it, that there is no new restructuring on top of that? The restructuring basically is now confined to what you've articulated? Or is there more still potential? David Farr : No. What I just laid out for this year is locked and -- okay, is it going to $210 million? Is it going to be $220 million? Yes, that's what we're talking about right there at this point in time. We are and -- but we're going to show you '21 and what we're going for, as you well know, we wanted to try to get everything done within a 24-month time period best we could. So we're going to -- we did a little bit last quarter. I mean, in the fourth fiscal quarter last year. We're doing a lot right now in this period right here in '20. We're going to be doing a pretty busy '21. But when we get out of '21, I want to move back towards our stability run rate of restructuring, which typically is around $50 million. So you're going to see how we go up to over $400 million total in the cycle and how we're focusing that. But what we told you this year, that number ain't changing unless I have -- okay, I shouldn't say ain't because it could change.  But if we had something happen to the world relative to a major change, and we have to refocus, something happens in China, something happens with the business, but right now, that's what we locked and loaded. And I would say that's going to keep our hands full for the year. John Inch : So what we're going to hear then on the 13th other than the traditional analyst review, the Board -- you guys have McKinsey in there. You've done this, obviously, top to bottom look through. You're going to be talking about the strategy or the payback? Or -- so if there's no more new restructuring, what should we expect? Like... David Farr : We're going to talk about macro restructuring. We're going to talk about outcome is on the review of our businesses. We're going to talk about the cash flow generation and how we're going to allocate that cash flow generation for the next couple of years, and some fundamental strategies. You're going to see a presentation on digital transformation coming out from one of Lal's key new platform leaders, which we built. Or yes, not platform, but business level units presence. And then we'll also -- we're going to give you an update on what -- on the Final Control work that Ram's doing. Ram's going to give a presentation on where he's taking this to the next level. So there's a lot -- there's going to be a lot of strategy, the company insights, what we're doing and how we're going to drive.  But fundamentally, I want you to walk away with the strategies in place, and we're driving cost, and we're going to drive around that business. We're also going to give you an update after 18 months of owning the Textron Tools business. We're going to give you an update around the professional tools and how that program is going. Both B&C and the professional tool ones are going very well, and they're a key part of our repositioning effort to drive value. And Tim's down here in the room, down here he's real happy because he's going to be part of that, maybe. And we're thinking about -- there's a couple of positions open like HR and maybe plant management and we're going to put him in there and see if he's going to do anything different. Operator : The next question is from Deepa Raghavan at Wells Securities. Deepa Raghavan : Just a quick question on the -- clarification on the EPS range that you are maintaining. We understand the coronavirus impacts are not easy to assess. But how does the $3.67 guidance at midpoint feel given what we know now? It looks like there's a virus impact, your North American region is trending below your expectations. Just curious, do these newer headwinds just put the upper part of the sales range, but keep the midpoint -- sorry, upper part of the EPS guide range intact -- but sorry, risk is to the upper part of the EPS range, but keeps the midpoint impact? Or is there any risk to the midpoint also at this point in time? David Farr : No, we wouldn't put a guidance out there. I didn't think -- I mean, we can believe we can hit both ends of this, both the top and the bottom, the middle. But our feeling right now, based on the trend lines is that the midpoint is the most likely. The upper point even with the coronavirus because we're assuming that they'll get -- it will come back, and production will start coming back up. And we'll start calling back some of that -- the $50 million to $100 million of sales. So we fundamentally believe that, that range is still viable, even with everything we face around the world at this point in time. The cost actions are happening. We get a little bit more cost out. From the timing issue, it's always a lot of timing in there. It can help our margins, and obviously, help the EPS. So at this point in time, that range is very -- we're very comfortable in that range. And we feel -- I mean, my highest probability, clearly, is at that 0, but I also see -- I still see some potential on the positive side, too. Deepa Raghavan : All right. Another clarification question is on China, again. Can you ring-fence what percent of your China sales or profits are in the affected areas versus your overall China exposure? I know you gave us a supply chain number, and the impact is... David Farr : No, I think we can't do that. That China sales are -- we saw across all of the markets depending on where the -- which customer is going on right now, the customers are going to be further west, east north. Now we -- there's no way we can break that down at this point in time. I mean, it's going to be a -- this one is going to be kind of fluid as we see things moving back up. And I know our sales force are going to try to figure out how they can claw some of those back. So these -- they're going to be pretty energized to figure out how to get that business back. It may come in a different location. So I -- it's -- there's nothing says at this point in time. Operator : Your next question is from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe a first question on Slide 13, the restructuring costs and earnings tailwinds. So you have the restructuring costs of $0.26, the benefit this year of $0.07. So that balance is sort of $0.19. Do we assume that, that's a mix of what's recognized in 2021? And also, what's kind of reinvested in 2020 and things like the service network? Just wondered how we thought about that drop through? David Farr : So now we will share with you how the savings are going to flow up in '21 and '22, and I'm not sharing that with you yet. But we'll share that out with you. So you're trying to see, I mean, say that again, Julian? Say that one more time? Julian Mitchell : Sure. So it's just that on that Slide 13, you're spending about $0.26 worth of restructuring this year, and you're recognizing $0.07 as the benefit. So I just wondered that balance of $0.19, is it all coming next year? Or a portion of that $0.19 is just -- is reinvested into the business? David Farr : No. No. No. So a big chunk of our savings will come next year of the delta, the spend from the standpoint. The area that we'll still have some delay out is going to be around the facility restructuring in the facilities because that may not start falling until early '22 or late '21. But what we see there is there's -- the reinvestments built into our core plan, we took the cost out. And we've netted that out already. There's nothing else going on here from that standpoint. Those savings will flow, and there'll be a -- there should be a significant increase in savings as we move into '21, and you'll see that and as Lal talks about his repositioning effort. And as you know, there's very little cash being impacted here because we're pretty -- we've been pretty good about managing that cash flow and trying to keep it cash neutral. So those savings and multiple, I would say, 90% of those savings will flow back into '21, and we'll still have a little tail hanging over us in '22 from this restructuring right there you're talking about. Julian Mitchell : That helps. And then my second question, just on the top line outlook in Automation Solutions. Maybe just focused on the sort of chemicals and petrochem piece of Automation Solutions. Some companies last week like AspenTech sounded pretty negative on chemical spending. Some of the customers in petrochem like Chevron or ExxonMobil are under some pressure. So I know you had good orders growth in your chemicals and petrochem piece in calendar Q4. Do you think that can continue through this year? Or it's more likely to get sort of lumpier? David Farr : Right now, we still feel pretty good about it. Now I don't think -- I think the first quarter number was a little bit stronger than I thought it would be. We had some project business come in there. But Julian, I don't -- we're not too worried about that at this point in time. Now I'd like to see another quarter of what's going on there. But that business, that petrochemical, the chemical businesses, and as we know, we serve a lot broader group of that customer base than an AspenTech will serve. Frank Dellaquila : And our KOB 3, first of all. David Farr : Yes. And we've got strong KOB 3 going on right there. So I don't feel concerned about that. I'm more worried about the upstream side and the new oil and gas investments. I think what I see coming down the downstream right now, I feel better about it. And that's a very high KOB 3 marketplace. And as I said earlier, when some of the guys asked me, I firmly believe we'll continue to see some improvement in KOB 1. So I'm more optimistic about that. Operator : The next question is from Jeff Sprague at Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : I guess this kind of dovetails off an earlier question, but just kind of thinking about incrementals. So obviously, if we're in a no-growth environment, incrementals is kind of a non-constant, I guess, right? But are you suggesting to us though that we should assume you do some kind of normal 30% or so incremental on growth, and we can drop at the end of this 2 or 3 year period of time, $425 million of savings on top of that? David Farr : Yes. That's what we're talking about doing here. I mean, if we -- we're going to have the incremental growth in sales. We'll show that to you as we lay out our plan, and then obviously, the restructuring that we're going to flow through. And as someone -- I think Julian has asked me about the reinvestments. So we'll lay that detail. We went through that with the Board because they want -- the Board is very, very interested in making sure we don't cut key programs long term. But we're trying to structurally make some changes here so that -- that it does flow through. The key thing right now is we're banking on very little growth here for the next 12 to 18 months. That's the key issue. Jeffrey Sprague : Yes. And that 30% to 35%, is that kind of the ZIP code you're comfortable with for incremental? David Farr : I think we're building on 30% from that standpoint. That's what we're building it on, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : And then on the LNG stuff, so it was good to see some of the orders come through. Just wondering two things. Was the stuff that was released and hit your order book deliverable from a revenue standpoint for 2020 as it currently stood? And... David Farr : I don't think we'll see any deliveries on that. I think you could have some progress payments and some of the stuff... Frank Dellaquila : Yes. Stuff that went to orders, and we'll start working on it. And what we've... David Farr : Yes. And so what we -- we probably -- we will probably have some progress payments in the latter part of 2020. It'll be more falling into '21. As you well know that where these bookings will go, you'll see more coming. It goes -- obviously, the compressors and the big LNG projects, our systems, then the control valves, then instrumentation. So we are in the early stages of this 4 way right now. So we should -- we're anticipating here in the next 2, 3, 4 months a continuation of booking some stuff. And I wouldn't see that we'll book money sales this year to be more than 2021, but I guarantee we'll have some progress payments probably in the Systems in late this year. Jeffrey Sprague : So if you thought of your total scope on these projects, kind of total Emerson scope like what have you booked so far? We're talking like only 10% or 20% of the project value so far? Frank Dellaquila : We expect are very small. David Farr : Very small. Very small. Very small. And that's one of the concerns, I think, I can't remember which of you guys mentioned this, my concern is this whole book. Coronavirus, could that slow down the process here a little bit again, as we've got it going again with trade deal that Mike mentioned. There was the trade -- first, Phase 1, and now the coronavirus, will that slow things down again? That's always a concern of mine. That's why we need to get through this, and so we can get a little bit more visibility on what everyone's going to do. But right now, we should have a lot more bookings around those major projects. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan. Patrick Baumann : This is actually Pat Baumann on for Steve Tusa. So yes, so he gave me an opportunity to harass you. Hey, on the restructuring, can you explain why you're seeing minimal net cash impacts from the actions you're taking? And then what was the comment on the cash flow based taxes you made about healthy results? David Farr : Yes. So go ahead. Frank Dellaquila : This is Frank. There's a lag on the spend versus when we book the expense that's pretty significant as we get out of the gate here. And then a not insignificant portion of the restructuring is noncash. It's facilities, it's asset write-downs and things of that nature. So when we wash it all through, we think the net impact in 2020 will probably be not terribly significant, less than $50 million. David Farr : Yes. I mean, a lot of times, and the people, which was our front-load late last year, early this year, there's cash upfront, but you get -- eventually you get some of that cash back because you're not paying. So it washes out and right now -- and cash generation is pretty good. So I mean net's going to be pretty neutral. The taxes, just basically some work that Frank's been doing relative to some are international subs as we go through this process... Frank Dellaquila : Yes. It's just ongoing reorganizations that we've been doing. We've had several discrete tax benefits last year. I don't expect them to be the same magnitude this year, but we will have a little bit here and there, and we had a -- we get to know the cash tax savings that actually went through into the cash flow in the first quarter. Patrick Baumann : What will be the net cash out for the $425 million you mentioned? David Farr : Oh, I don't have the number off the top of my head. It's -- Frank, do you have a number, a rough number? Frank Dellaquila : I have, I would say, in the end, 80%, 85% of it is probably going to be cash... David Farr : Over time. Yes. Frank Dellaquila : It's lumpy. I mean, the timing is the key. David Farr : And the key issue there is that the sooner you get some of the cash impact once done, the faster you get the cash payback, because it takes off quickly. The facility one's are the hardest part because they -- the cash goes out, and then you don't get the savings for a long time. Patrick Baumann : Okay. Maybe switching gears, just -- can you give us an update on what you're seeing in resi, a few markets in North America. What did the business do for sales in the quarter? And kind of what's your outlook there for this year? David Farr : I mean, North America is still in a tough zone right now. We're in sort of the middle of winter here, flat to slightly down. Don't -- I mean, it's hard to say how fast. I mean, the one thing I'd like is a residential marketplace truck. Construction's doing good. That's a good sign. Typically, we start seeing some payback and some improvement here as we get into that March time period. So that's not going to be -- it's not going to be much of a change until we get into a little bit warm weather. We had a good quarter in Asia and China. That was before everything happened there that bothers me. And so I'm a little bit concerned about that now as we come out of it. We hear from President Xi, he's going to try and pump up the financing and try to get some spending going to get the economy going, a strong stimulus, which could -- typically, that goes after the market, the commercial residential guys go after versus the auto solution guys done. But right now, our HVAC business in North America is weak. And we're forecasting probably our sixth down quarter in total for commercial residence, globally. And then the question is, can we see some improvement as we move into the second half of the year. Patrick Baumann : Did you see anything in the orders in January out of China that made you -- makes you concerned at all about the business there? Or is there more just like -- what do you expect? David Farr : They were -- they were pretty much what we expected. It's slightly negative. It was not that good. Again, it's a short month because it's the Chinese New Year. And so from that perspective, it's a pretty small month. But I'm really worried about what we -- we're trying to take orders over the phone right now. We're still alive, but there's not much business going on. So I'm really worried about as we get into this post February 10 as we start seeing what people do, what happens in that? And that -- so it's certainly live here after that February 10 time period comes in for the next 2 or 3 weeks to see if there's any slowdown or pick back up, we'll see. Operator : The next question is from Joe Ritchie at Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : So just focused on Automation Solutions for a second, and really first. And really just trying to think about the margin step-up expected in your fiscal second quarter. So clearly, there's definitely some headwinds out there. We talked about coronavirus. I'm just curious, like, are things expected to get better, much better, in fiscal 2Q versus fiscal 1Q from a mix standpoint? And then, secondly, clearly, you guys took a lot of restructuring actions here in the first quarter. And so do we start seeing a pretty sizable benefit from those actions in fiscal 2Q? David Farr : Yes. Okay. So did you back into Auto Sol's margins in the second quarter? Is that what you did? Joseph Ritchie : Yes, I backed in as well -- I mean, you have margins up. David Farr : Yes, you could back into them. Yes. So there's two things. One, auto sales, if you think about progression, our second quarter sales typically are seasonally higher and that, obviously, in the second quarter. And we are expecting some stability around the mix of business around that flow in the discrete business. So that is not -- that's normal for us. So -- and then we've obviously started to get some savings, some of the $35 million that we spend aggressively in the fourth quarter. Most of that was around Auto Sol. And obviously, a lot of the $97 million over -- almost, I think, $85 million of it was around Auto Sol in the first quarter.  And so you're seeing -- those guys are going to start seeing that benefit more and more about that as they go into that second quarter and clearly ramps up into the third and fourth quarters. But that's how we see it right now, and the savings are happening because these are really near-term cost actions that are taken. Joseph Ritchie : Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then, I guess, just my one follow-up. I saw that there's no change to the buyback portion of the bridge. I guess the question I have is, like, look, your balance sheet is in great shape. You guys have the opportunity to toggle it up if you want to and be a little bit more aggressive with the buyback. I guess at this juncture, like, what's holding you back from potentially doing a little bit more? David Farr : I mean, first of all, I think if you look at our history, we buy back substantially more stock than most people. And secondly, we also continue to want to work on the acquisition front, an investment company. If we feel that we don't have the opportunities, we'll continue to take that buyback up. But right now, if I look at what we've bought back the last several years, there's been a pretty high pace, and I don't see any reason to take it any higher at this point in time.  Now the Board always reviews that if we see the acquisition front state is very moderate, then we're going to have the situation coming forth that we're going to have to increase the leverage and the balance sheet. But keep in mind, I've said it again, we're already paying back shareholders 85% of our cash flow in 2020. 85%. That is a good number. Operator : Our last question comes from Robert McCarthy at Stephens. Robert McCarthy : I guess the first question, have you had any contact with the Chinese authorities about the nature of the response, what they need to do, any kind of comfort around that? Because, obviously, it seems to be there's definitely a credibility gap that seems to be emerging over the last couple of days? And any thoughts around that just given the fact that you have substantial tendrils in China. David Farr : Our organization, we have a leadership there. The team's in constant contact with the Chinese government, and we get a -- Mike and I and the top OC get a daily report back out from what they're being told by the government, both at the national level and the local level. I mean, I disagree that the Chinese government are misleading people. I feel they've been very open to us. Now everyone wants a hard answer, but you can't get a hard answer in something that's moving like this.  But as I look at the consistent information I'm getting from the government and to the regional governments to my people and my leadership team that reports into Mike, I feel very good about it. So my comfort level right now is pretty high. But key issue for me is can they get the plant there -- a lot of the people go back to work if nothing else major happens here. And then can the supply chain start mobilizing, because logistics could be a problem as things start flowing around. But it's just a matter of getting planning. And I know Mike and all the guys and gals across China are working this pretty hard right now. So I feel -- my comfort level is pretty good, assuming they can hold that tent. Or if it goes to 11% to 12%, that does a big deal. Within that, a couple of days, that's -- Rob.  So I feel -- I think we're ready at this point in time. But again, it goes back to the Apollo moon shots when it comes back in the United States, we're in that blackout period right now, the reentry blackout period for about the next 5 or 6 days. Robert McCarthy : Yes. I mean, to that point, it's almost -- it seems like your guidance outlook could have two very almost binary outcomes or trajectories because, one, you could see global synchronous downturn, real problems with supply chain, demand destruction in oil impacting your projects to a material degree. But then, obviously, high visibility on you in terms of your cost actions. Conversely, if we do have a quicker than expected resolution to this, you could see a pronounced rebound in oil, which would probably be broadly stimulative of upstream projects. You could see the -- an upside to growth, overall, which -- and obviously, maybe attentively, M&A, but that obviously puts a lot more pressure on you to deliver the restructuring in what would be fundamentally a different demand environment. How do you square the circle in terms of where we could be? David Farr : Yes. I don't -- first of all, I'm not in the Pandora's box, which is your first thing, where you might as well throw in a couple of locus to tax and maybe some ships going down and claims going down at the same time there. And I'm not in that side of the equation. I think that -- and I -- there are -- I could say that there could be some positives as this thing recovers pretty quickly, I feel that. But I'm more in the status right now that this thing slowly recovers and regrowth comes back.  We probably lose a couple of points of the high-single-digit growth that we were talking about for China, which takes a little bit away from us a little bit. So I'm more the glass half full than the glass empty or glass awful, we see this one. Frank Dellaquila : Even if they're doing stimulus, it's going to really be more than that, make it to next year, even. David Farr : Yes. I think we get -- let's -- I know everyone's trying to guess, second guess this. I think you've got to wait -- those dates, the 10th, and they've been holding here pretty consistent. If those things hold in let's say, the 10th or 11th, going back to work and we start seeing the plants up and running, then I feel good about that. Now If the plants start starting up and they start failing, and that could be a good thing for us because it's obviously business. But I think we've got to watch that. So you've got to listen to all your -- all the people you follow and listen to them and see how things are starting. And I think that will be the key indication. Are they starting up or not starting up? Where they getting the supplies? I think you're going to hear people communicate that pretty loud and clear. David Farr : I want to thank everybody. Again, I want to thank the global organization. I want to thank the investors and the shareholders for supporting us as we go through this process. Thank you very much now. Bye. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Pete Lilly : Good morning, and thank you, and welcome, everyone, to Emerson's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Today, I am joined by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Train, Emerson President; Lal Karsanbhai, Executive President of Automation Solutions; Bob Sharp, Executive President of Commercial and Residential Solutions; and we are also joined by a special guest, President of Professional Tool Business in Europe. Mr. Tim Reeves is who is unfortunately still stuck in the United States.  And before we begin, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mr. David Farr for some opening remarks. David Farr : Thank you very much, Pete. I want to welcome everyone here. For your information, we are sitting in my conference room, properly spread out and we have been operating, Emerson has been open throughout this whole process. We made the decision as OCE on March 10th when I came back from a conference in New York when I was presenting at J.P. Morgan as always you all showed up. And so, I made the decision with the OCE to stay open. We have the OCE here every day. We are properly spread out. As you guys know this office complex. We also have about 15 other executives throughout this floor. We get together on an ongoing basis to make sure we are making decisions, constantly making decisions.  We shut the rest of salary workforce down and send them home and they are working from home. But I was \u2013 I felt it was important with this crisis that we were here, arrive and we can make quick decisions and deal with the issues very, very quickly both from a structural standpoint, but also from a competitive standpoint and look at opportunities to keep winning as a company.  The opening slide I want to share with you, Honeywell has been involved with making masks that are quite running up in Rhode Island. That\u2019s a slight new plant coming up in Arizona. We work very closely with Honeywell with Darius and I actually talked several times on this issue to make sure they got equipment where we allocated Branson makes welding equipment that makes the masks around the world and testing equipment.  And so, this is currently the facility in Rhode Island, which is the picture up with our equipment and the Honeywell mask and this is where CEOs around the world what I call frenemies work very closely together to get things done for the nation, for the world and I just want to make comment to that because this is a situation where Honeywell and I are working together to do something right for America and not necessarily speaking up as something out.  So, I want to turn it back over to Pete. But again, here we are sitting here. We are properly spread out. Tim is holding my Raleigh monkey and making sure that it doesn\u2019t get Coronavirus. So with that, Pete it\u2019s all yours. Pete Lilly : Thanks, Dave. As usual, I encourage everyone to please follow along the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Moving to Slide 4 with the results of the quarter. Underlying sales growth was well below expectations, down 7% driven by the dramatic drop in global demand as the Covid-19 pandemic quickly spread in March. Trailing three month orders were down 3% also reflected by the decaying demand environment, but indicating some modest backlog build-up.  GAAP earnings per share were flat and adjusted earnings per share were up 7% to $0.89, driven primarily by lower stock compensation cost due to a lower stock price and aggressive restructuring actions started in Q3 of last year starting to take effect. Despite lower sales, both platforms executed well on profitability exceeding their adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA peak margin plans for the quarter due to previously initiated and ongoing restructuring actions.  Automation Solutions\u2019 underlying sales were down 8% and trailing three month orders were down 1%, also well below initial expectations due to the pandemic demand environment taken shape in March. Commercial and Residential Solutions\u2019 underlying sales and orders were both down 5%.  Cash flow performance was solid in the quarter with operating cash flow of $588 million and free cash flow of $477 million, up 10% and 15% respectively. The business returned over $1.1 billion to shareholders including over $800 million in share repurchases and over $300 million in dividends.  Lastly, the company continued and built upon its aggressive cost reset plans initiating $40 million of restructuring actions in the quarter.  Turning to Slide 5, we\u2019ll cover the P&L. Second quarter gross margin was flat at 42.1%, that\u2019s favorable price costs and cost containment actions offset the declining revenues. SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 130 basis points reflective of the drop in stock compensation costs due to a lower share price.  Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA margins, which exclude restructuring and related costs increased 240 basis points and 300 basis points respectively. These improvements primarily reflect the lower stock compensation cost combined with aggressive cost containment actions taking effect.  Overall, the company continued to execute on peak margin plans which were laid out at our February investor conference. In addition to responding quickly with additional actions, as sales deteriorated in March and the economic outlook for the remainder of the year became increasingly challenging.  Now turning to Slide 6. Geographically, we saw a broad based weakness unfold in the quarter for particularly and the U.S., down 8% and over 20% respectively. Europe, which finished down 2% showed strength really in the quarter which was quickly forwarded in March as the virus rapidly spread and most countries closed their doors.  Please turn to Slide 7. Total segment adjusted EBIT margin increased 50 basis points to 17.6% reflecting the aggressive cost control measures and strong operational execution as sales declined. Stock compensation cost decreased $97 million as the stock price moved dramatically lower in the quarter.  Q2 cash flow performance was solid. Operating cash flow increased by 10% to $588 million and free cash flow increased by 15% to $477 million representing 91% converting. Trade working capital ended higher as a percentage of sales as ending inventory increased due to the sharp drop in demand in March. Turning to Slide 8, we will bridge second quarter EPS. Working from our 2019 adjusted EPS of $0.83, you see that non-operating tailwinds totaled $0.14, led by lower stock compensation due to a lower share price. Operations declined $0.10 reflective of the volume declines due to Covid-19, while share repurchases and lower interest cost delivered $0.02. Adjusted EPS finished at $0.89. In summary, non-operating tailwinds were largely offset by the effects of Covid-19 on operations. Importantly, total segment adjusted EBIT increased by 50 basis points and total segment adjusted EBITDA increased by a 120 basis points reflecting just 9% deleverage on $400 million of lower sales versus prior year.  Now we will review the business platforms. Turning to Slide 10. Automation Solutions underlying sales finished down 8% for the quarter as sharp declines in oil and gas more than offset some growth in life sciences and food and beverage. The U.S. dropped 12% while China was down sharply over 20%.  Trailing three months underlying orders were down 1% driven by the early quarter relative strength of the longer cycle businesses, panel control and systems, which grew 3% and 7% respectively. Of note, backlog grew by 3% to nearly $5.1 billion on a sequential basis compared to the last quarter. The platform delivered strong profitability in a very challenging demand environment.  Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA margins were up 50 basis points and a 130 basis points respectively reflecting aggressive cost actions taking effect. Restructuring actions totaled $29 million across the platform which brought the total to $112 million for the first half of the year.  Turning to Slide 11. Commercial and Residential Solutions underlying sales were down 5%, also reflective of the deteriorating demand environment with Covid-19. North America dropped low-single-digits while Europe dropped 1% as modest momentum in the ecom business was more than offset by declines in the tools business. Asia, Middle East and Africa were down 15% driven by China which was down sharply over 30%. Trailing three months underlying orders were down 5% at each of the HVAC, Cold Chain, and Tools businesses were down mid-single digits. Asia orders dropped 14%, driven by China, which dropped over 25%.  Commercial & Residential Solutions also delivered strong profitability with adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA up 40 basis points and 90 basis points respectively. This outcome was driven primarily by aggressive cost control, cost actions and favorable price cost dynamics.  For the quarter, restructuring actions totaled $9 million, which crossed a total figure to $19 million for the first half. Turning to Slide 13, we will review the updated guidance. The speed and breadth of the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak has been truly unprecedented. As such, we see a very challenging demand environment certainly for the remainder of the fiscal year and into the first half of next year. Additionally, we assume that oil prices will stabilize in the $20 to $30 per barrel.  Later in the call, management will elaborate on our outlook in detail, but here is the summary. Based on conversations with customers, government officials, internal analysis in comparison to previous downturns, we now expect underlying sales to be down 9% to 7% and net sales to be down 11% to 9% for the year.  Due to the deteriorating demand environment, we\u2019ve increased restructuring spend to be approximately $280 million with approximately $230 million comes from \u2013 coming from the Automation Solutions platform and $45 million coming from the Commercial and Residential Solutions platform.  We now expect adjusted EPS in the range of $3 to $3.20, a reduction of approximately 16% at the midpoint. We expect operating cash flow to come in at approximately $2.75 billion and CapEx spending expectations have been decreased by $100 million to $550 million resulting in a free cash flow target of approximately $2.2 billion.  Lastly, our share repurchase program for the year is now complete at approximately $950 million. Please turn to Slide 14, which bridges our updated 2020 adjusted EPS guidance. The starting point of the bridge is 2019 GAAP EPS of $3.71. Walking across, we have 2019 adjusted EPS of $3.69 which excludes $0.14 of favorable discrete tax items and adds back $0.12 of restructuring.  Now, walking across from $3.69, we expect a total of $0.11 of headwinds this year for FX, stock comp and pension. Operational headwinds have dramatically increased. We have reduced our full year sales plan by approximately $1.8 billion from prior year resulting in a $0.50 - $0.57 headwind. We expect $0.09 of EPS from interest and share repurchase tailwinds. This gets us to a full year adjusted EPS midpoint of $3.10. Of note, since the major portfolio transformation of 2015 to 2016 and resumes average 42% to 43% of full year estimate EPS by the end of the first half. This year our first half adjusted EPS fell over $1.56 which is approximately 50% of the full year EPS guidance, well ahead of normal pace. Please turn to Slide 15, which lays out our third quarter 2020 guidance. The underlying sales outlook for the quarter is dramatically negative reflecting near-term challenges and in a elongated recovery in industrial markets from the Covid-19 lockdown, combined with low oil prices and associated spending reductions.  Underlying sales is expected to be down 16% to 13%. We expect adjusted EPS of $0.60, plus or minus $0.04, which excludes roughly $100 million of planned restructuring actions in the quarter. We see total segment adjusted EBIT in the 15% to 15.5% range and adjusted EBITDA in the 20% to 20.5% range reflective of aggressive cost control measures, somewhat offsetting the reduction volume. And now please turn to Slide 17. I will hand the call over to Mr. Frank Dellaquila and Mr. Mike Train to discuss liquidity and operations. Frank Dellaquila : Good morning, everybody. We wanted to spend just a few minutes here on liquidity, to spell any concerns anyone has. We are in really good shape. We believe we never take this for granted. We are never complacent but we believe we are in very, very strong position as we enter the downturn here.  We have the capacity to fund all of our internal needs and our dividends despite the fact that we \u2013 as you just saw, we expect reduced operating cash flow over the next several quarters. We have a modest amount of leverage even in downturn in less than two times debt-to-EBITDA at year end on this plan. 65% of our total debt is term debt and as a result we have very good liquidity in our capital structure and we will begin at Slide 17, just walk you down those points.  At March 31, we had $2.6 billion of cash. More than half of that is available on a same day or at most next day notice. So we are in very, very good shape if there should be a market disruption and we also have a $3.5 billion revolver, which is not drawn and it\u2019s committed through April of 2023. We also have the right to extend it under the current terms and we are in all financial covenants in the revolver. So, all in all, as we look at our ability to fund our needs short-term and longer term, we feel like we are in very good shape.  If you please turn to Slide 18, when we begin to \u2013 when we began to see this coming in mid-February, we started to extend maturities in the CP program. At first, it was difficult, because the market wants somewhat royal.  It improved when the Fed stepped in and announced a couple of programs to indirectly and directly support the commercial payment market and as a result, over the last month and a half, we\u2019ve been able to extend the CP maturities from about 20 days out to 45 days and including that \u2013 included in that, we built a $1 billion cash buffer here in the United States, which we will revisit as we go through time here and if we get comfortable that things are improving, we\u2019ll start to work that down. But for now, we think it\u2019s prudent to have that on the balance sheet just in case that there should be a downward turn in market conditions. We are also evaluating an issuance of term debt. Credit spreads\u2013 pretty significantly in the beginning of this crisis. They\u2019ve come in quite a bit since then and all in cost for term debt for investment-grade companies are pretty attractive.  So we are obviously looking at that now with a view toward injecting more liquidity into the capital structure. So you can see they are on chart 18, kind of the maturity profile CP plays out. And then finally on chart 19, we\u2019ve always maintained a very conservative debt matter.  Always been very conscious of spreading out maturities, so you can see that we have a lot of places there where if we choose to issue term debt over the next month or so here we can do that in size and still have a very conservative debt matter as we hit the open spots between that towers we have there.  So, again, in sum, I think we are in very, very good shape regarding liquidity. We are going to watch it very closely. But we feel pretty good about our ability to do everything we need to do as we go through this downturn. David Farr : Thank you. I ask Frank to talk to shareholders this morning about this issue. Frank and his team, I have to give tremendous kudos for accomplishing what they\u2019ve done. They came to us in early February long, and basically say and we need to start take an action. Frank also worked very closely with the finance committee, the Chairman and several of the members of the finance committee who are very knowledgeable of what\u2019s going on in the marketplace and they instructed us very well of the time.  We also have several executives, but we had a Executive Board Meeting that discussed this issue and other actions. And then we also \u2013 last week we pulled up our Board Meeting and had a four hourBoard Meetingwith the Board and then, yesterday we had the audit Committee Meeting. So we are trying to communicate to our Board to get their inputs.  But most importantly, it was our look at this, the liquidity, the financial structure, the ability to finance this company and times like this are very, very crucial. And Frank and his team has done an outstanding job with that.  Before Mike has a comment about the battles he has been fighting around the world, I want to remind people on start 2020 for the new sell-side or investors out there. Emerson had a very global retail strategy since back \u2013 since the day I started running the company as a CEO back in 2000. And we\u2019ve had this strategy when we looked the world on an Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific, we go from manufacturing, engineering, supply chain, customer sales and support service and we look at ways \u2013 I call it the tick back chart.  We look at ways that we could serve the global marketplaces out of one or two and maybe even three of the retail areas. This has been one of our strategies from day one. I also want to thank the audit committee and the work that the Head of Audit, Lisa Flavin who runs audit for us here onsite, work on an enterprise rich strategy which analyzes this chart and making sure that it works and it has worked. As we\u2019ve gone through this strategy, we first tested it clearly in February and early March with the China shutdown.  And we\u2019ve tested it again. Now there are issues we will deal with when we get out of this, but from my perspective, this whole retail strategy when you hear now even the President of United States talk about that something that\u2019s been very effective for this company relative to serving our customers and I want to make sure people remember that we have this, we will fine tune this a little bit when we come out of this, because I see some different issues in today\u2019s world. But this is a living document that we\u2019ve obviously adjusted over the years including when we had so much concentration in China. About eight years ago, and many of you know that I started making moves with the team and moved some production out of China and diversify it more around the world.  But again, I want to thank Frank and the work in the finance committee and then also want to thank the globe operations and I\u2019ll have more comments on this in a second.  Before I turn it over to Mike, when we got the OCE together in early March, we formed many, many tax boards led by the OCE It wasn't that one throat to choke here. We had everyone involvedand one of thethings thatMike stood up to do is dealing with the international markets, international governments and making sure that we can keep our facilities open both from a manufacturing standpoint and a sales operations and supply chain. And Mike has extremely broad and deep knowledge of international markets he\u2019s been working for pretty much his whole life here at Emerson. And so, Mike has been leading this battle with the operating leaders, at the same time taking care of this battle. So, Mike, I am turning over to you and update the shareholders of how we see it right now. Michael Train : to: Let\u2019s go to chart 21. We\u2019d obviously recall last time we were together it was our Investor Meeting on February 13. Our China operations were just getting restarted after a government mandate we closed for two weeks. And then the days were a bit rugged as suppliers took some time to get clear to restart and there was quite a challenge on intra-province and international logistics.  This has significantly improved in the past month as we\u2019ve seen our China business starting to come back in a stronger way and I know Lal and Bob will provide some insights on that in a moment. Now as the Coronavirus again make its way around the world, we saw challenges to our operational capability imposed by governments as they implemented various forms of stay home, shelter in place and lockdown orders.  Emerson provides critical infrastructure products and essential services and with great effort we\u2019ve been able to gain government recognition and designation. China led to the South Korea, Italy impacts, which then moved along to France and Russia, Middle East and the Americas.  It\u2019s been a highly dynamic environment and I must give our global Emerson team who are likely listening into today\u2019s call, a big thank you for their collective efforts in working with customers, suppliers, and governments to keep these critical industries running, running when it\u2019s needed most.  In the last weeks of March and early April, we saw a multitude of states in U.S. and multiple countries around the world implement these orders which tens of thousands of our own employees who have been to work from home mode and it\u2019s been amazing watch the Emerson teams deal with a sudden reality and come through in every aspect.  Not great timing from the end of a quarter perspective but our plans on balance stayed up and running and we get our best to deliver to customers. As we sit here today, we are still working some major issues.  The India lockdown which was recently extended to May 3rd has proven exceptionally challenging with logistics and the ability to operate where shutdown practically overnight and we worked down to get all of our plants designated critical and up and running to some extent.  Things are now moving in the right direction, but we have several weeks to go before really get back some solid points. We have worked closely with the government officials there and I appreciate their engagement.  In Europe, we witnessed some rough times in Italy, but things are much improved now. We are still working through some supplier issues and community sentiment in Europe. But again, directionally things are going in the right way.  In the Americas, the USA has been incredibly interesting to navigate. I need to highlight the guidance the Department of Homeland Security issued on critical infrastructure and essential services and with a few exceptions, our states and cities are aligned on this guidance.  Right now I am spending my time on Mexico, where there is still significant efforts to manage the virus and I am working to get alignment on critical infrastructure guidance both within Mexico and in concert with the U.S. and Canada.  David a lot of detail here for investors. Hopefully this gives some good snapshot of how the world is dealing with the virus inclining its way back. I know we have some China conversation coming up which maybe important thinking throughout things play out over the next few quarters.  Again to my Emerson colleagues, thanks for the tremendous effort and collaboration, real importance as we keep food, medicines, energy, electricity, medical goods, everything else in touch falling to our communities. David Farr : Well, Mike, I want to thank you very much for this issue. This is not easy to the 24 hours a day, seven days a week, day in and day out over the weekend you and I were talking a lot. You are talking to various people, dealing with political leaders at all levels to make sure they understand the importance of this and then working very close with hands-in-hands with operation.  I also want to make a call out to Steve Pelch and the organization relative to the work they\u2019ve done on safety and all the task force that we\u2019ve rolled out with how Bob and Lal and the other team around the world knowing what\u2019s going on every day. We get reports around the world of what\u2019s happening with employees, if any of them contracted the Coronavirus, anyone has become tested positive, who is being isolated. Steve has organized this right now. He is now in a process working with the HR teams and the global manufacturing teams to get the \u2013 how do we come back out of this on a measured way and a safe way. How do we come back out of this operation and get everyone back to work and back into the buildings that we have from a salary standpoint and support our global manufacturing and technology.  But Mike in this area here, this is something that we\u2019ve never had realized before will we had to work governments at the highest level. This iswhere having those relationships that all of us have, everybody at this level and also retired executives that Emerson have that really may come home and help us in times like this. But for the people out there before I go into and I want to make out a comment, as you can imagine, we are fighting a global pandemic war and giving the CEO that runs this company you guys know me pretty well. I strongly believe that leaders need to be at the front. We don\u2019t need to be hiding in the bunkers or hiding at home, leaders to be at the front and fighting the war and winning this war.  And I want to make sure that a special recognition goes to the Board who has been working with us very closely with special meetings. The OCE, the senior executives, and all the world area people that are been engaged in the work in this \u2013 on the daily issues. It\u2019s amazing work comes up in a daily basis. But being together allows us to walk down the hall, colloquially stay apart from each other, other than every once in a while screaming at somebody.  So, they are too close. But it\u2019s important that we have this eyeball to eyeball contact to deal the issues. But again the Board, accelerated a Board Meeting. They accelerated the review of the numbers and the audit committee approved the numbers yesterday and we will be filing our Qs hopefully by Friday at the latest on Monday.  Also very important to all the employees around the world and customers is communications. And everyone of us might felt, and Bob and Lal and Steve and Mike, we\u2019ve all had videos. I am doing those sort of videos today. It is Bob I believe. We\u2019ve had notes. We\u2019ve had letters and we\u2019ve communicated constantly to our employees. So they know what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s important that they are not too worried about this because we are clearly in a war and we\u2019ve got to keep fighting this.  So, from my perspective, also I want to make one other comment. You\u2019ll see in the slide here and in a conversation I had with the executive board a couple weeks ago, we made the decision at the OCE level that we, at the Board level, at the OCE, we took a 15% base salary cut effective April 1st which now in place.  We went to the next senior level, executive levels, pretty high level all the way out down to 10% and then the rest of the global people involved on our bonus programs took a cut of 5% which you are going to see cutbacks. You are going to furloughs. There is a lot of things that\u2019s going to be happening here.  We pushed out all salary increases for twelve months. So it\u2019s a rolling process that people like me who know me get my salary increase in November time period. That will not happen in November of 2020. I won\u2019t get one until 2021, which most likely means I\u2019ll get nothing because I will be retiring. So be it.  On chart 23, I wanted to give you a sense of the orders. Now keep in mind, I know people are wondering how does Emerson only had negative 3% in the quarter. Well, the real impact started in the last 2.5 weeks in March. We as a company talked to you all in February. It\u2019s a meeting in New York around a 100 million and then we raised it a couple weeks later to about a 150 million. Then what happened is the world started engaging we saw the impact in the second half of March. So overall, we are only down 3%. Automation Solutions is only down 1%. If you look at Bob\u2019s five, he basically is in line. He is a book and ship company who was pretty well in line with his orders and sales for the quarter. So what this chart shows you though is clearly what we see now it\u2019s a pretty strong drop off in the month of April, May and June and July. And you are going to see orders that are now going to start bouncing in the negative 10%, negative 20%. And I know Lal and Bob will give you some color on this, but that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be facing right now, because historically, you would see that negative tree and say, well, Emerson will be okay in the third quarter.  That\u2019s not the case. It started dropping, but that \u2013 so I wanted to give you an understanding of why auto held up. We are doing well from the standpoint of what\u2019s going on in the economy. But it\u2019s still going to start dropping down and hence the very weak third quarter that Pete outlined with you earlier.  As you look at the underlying sales growth, that the OCE and we held web access around the world of our \u2013 leaders around the world over the last several weeks, in fact the last 45 days as we live together here, we now see a pretty strong downturn here in the third quarter, also in the fourth quarter. We see this is a four to six quarter reduction. This is on chart 24 and at that point in time we are structuring our cost accordingly.  This is not going to be a quick bang up, bang down, bang up. No it\u2019s not. It\u2019s going to take time. Now if you look at the 2021 numbers, those are directional only. We think that we are going the first half will be negative and then it will start turning back up.  The question will be how fast the governments open up certain parts of the world. How fast the governments stimulus comes into play. How fast is our some of our customers come in to play. We are now modeling what we think is going to be the 2021, 2022, 2023, but both from our internal standpoints we see more and more endpoints every day coming in from the customers, every day coming from around the world. But you look at this, we are looking at a pretty strong negative third quarter, down 14% ROI growth. Plus or minus prior two \u2013 third quarter which we\u2019ll talk about, Lal will talk further about minus 10, plus or minus 3 points. So, and then you see some negative growth as we move into the first half of next year.  So we are hunkering down into a very, very challenging 2020 and a challenging first half of 2021 and hence, the work that the operations and also the corporate done relative to cost and as I look at what\u2019s going on right now and we are in this pandemic work, we basically look at the situations of what we are evaluating everything. What we really need, what \u2013 I am evaluating the organization, which ones are rising these challenges. Which ones have the right stock and which ones are bunkering. And so, all these things are very, very important to me as we go in and spend our time every day here in the office and since there is no golf going on, I basically spend ten hours a day at the office and I go home and walk for about an hour-and-a-half every night with my wife and then I start thinking about things and I get back to the office. So, a lot of time in Emerson right now as I think true with this team, OCE team and talk about what\u2019s happening.  If you look at the aggressive cost actions that we started last year and that\u2019s what\u2019s really helped us. As you saw the close, both at Lal\u2019s business and Bob\u2019s business, if you think about what we did versus our guidance, our sales drop in the second quarter $240 million, the deleverage is only 15%. That\u2019s tremendous and you\u2019ll see Bob and Lal will give you little bit more detail on that.  Versus last year, if I look at from the second quarter standpoint, we dropped $408 million and we only deleveraged 9%. And now it\u2019s fundamental because of the work that Bob did last year early on and then also the work that Lal did in the second half of calendar year 2019. So, that really paid off. Cash flow, the guys around the world did a great job.  But now earnings are dropping and we are looking at a much tougher cash flow in the second half. But we still generate strong cash flow but not at the same level, because earnings are dropping. We clearly right now, as you look at the analysis on a cash flow in the first half, we are now starting to liquidate our balance sheet which is not unusual for Emerson.  We are very, very good at managing cash flow. Hence we generate strong cash flow in the first half of the year. But as we liquidate the balance sheet in the second half of the year, the toughest would be the inventory, because the inventory \u2013 the volume has dropped dramatically right now and then what will happen to us as we go into 2021, we\u2019ll start and have to add the balance sheet as we start growing the company again sometime in late 2021.  Restructuring has truly helped us both at the corporate level. I talked to you about the cutbacks we are taking across the world on salaries, on cutbacks and delays in salary increases, but also our bonuses will be \u2013 will significantly reduced. We are not going to zero bonus.  We\u2019ve cut them back significantly. We\u2019ll be setting targets around margins and cash and this is very important right now as we go through this positioning how to protect and maintain those margins and how to generate cash. And that\u2019s something that we are working on right now as a corporation and I\u2019ll work with the full cost committee and the full Board. We are also accelerating restructuring. We had a major restructuring program underway already. In 2020, we are going to spend 215, it\u2019s now up to 280. Both businesses are using this opportunity to really valuate how do we set the cost structure even stronger for us going forward, looking at layers, looking the organization and what do we really need to do relative to the organization to make sure we win, but also have a right cost structure and so we go through this time period.  We don\u2019t know exactly how things are dealt, but we have a good sense. I mean, this team has been around a long time. As you know, I\u2019ve been at Emerson for 40 years. If I want to run this room and ask how many years these senior executives in this room have been, these guys are well into the 20 into the 30s.  So they know \u2013 we know what\u2019s going on. We have very strong indications of what we\u2019ve seen before and what we see today. So, we are really looking at keeping the cost in line and making sure we stay aggressive. One of the things we\u2019ve done over the years, as you all know is we\u2019ve continued to diversify the company. Today, 80% of our \u2013 we have non-oil and gas end-markets. Oil and gas markets clearly upstream oil and gas, the pipeline and terminals. Even pipelines and terminals right now is a questionable market. Some of the terminals are actually growing. They are investing in terminals, because they are storing oil. But typically, we are down to basically 20% driven by this oil gas fluctuation. Our rest of the business we\u2019ve continued to diversify on and both Lal and Bob will talk a little bit about this. But we clearly have a different mix today and you\u2019ll see it here in a few minutes. And Bob has a very broad diversification around some key industries. And so it makes it a little bit different than we\u2019ve had in the past. Yes, we are going to get hurt by oil and gas investments when 20% of the company is around that upstream oil and gas. But you\u2019re also going to quickly see that we have a very strong KOB 3 business here in this marketplace.  The market is not going to zero. We are going to support these organizations and you will see the numbers are quite significant in the investments we\u2019ve made over the last ten years in our service organization and penetration in the aftermarket and Lal will talk about that.  One of the other things is clearly North America. In the North America, we obviously do very well. We have a very strong position in oil and gas. However, we also continued to diversify ourselves against our way from this marketplace and still support it. We are not walking away from it. We just have other businesses and from the standpoint of pharmaceutical, medical, chemical, whatever industries, power.  So if we look at where we see today, we think about the percent of automation sales. This year we are going to be in 10% to 12% on oil and gas North America. It\u2019s not going to go away. It\u2019s not going to go to zero.  You can see last year with $900 million upstream, this year we are looking around $750 million. I guarantee you that majority of that will be KOB 3 aftermarket business to keep the facilities safe and running and producing.  If you look back at the last industrial recession, we\u2019re well over $1 billion that dropped a little bit upstream, but it didn\u2019t go away. We don\u2019t have the numbers relative to the 2008, 2009 numbers, but you are going to see there, it\u2019s little bit higher percentage at that point in time. So we have continued to diversify.  We have continued to work our aftermarket business and what I really want to do for the guys and turn it over Lal in a second, but I wanted to give them to give you an insight relative to the business issue right now, also to give you some really strong insight that you are not going to get from a lot other people around China, actually giving you numbers, showing the shape of the curves of recovery.  But we have done a lot of work here thinking about what our investors would like to know about what\u2019s going inside Emerson and what we see day-to-day which clearly fluid, but, we as a team are working very quickly to react to this. And so, Lal, why don\u2019t you take them through this representation here. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. Thank you, David, and good morning. I\u2019d like to begin by acknowledging the global automation solutions team for a tremendous close to Q2, particularly as we faced rapidly deteriorating market conditions. This team has momentum in executing our peak margin plan and is focused on the additional challenges we now face.  So turning to chart 28. This is how the plan works from an orders and sales perspective in what is a significant demand-driven cycle. Orders were down eight tenths of a point in Q2 versus a 2.3% plan and weakening trough in Q3 and stay negative for five consecutive quarters as we have modeled the next four quarters.  From a global perspective, these are 2015, 2016 type of numbers. However in 2015 and 2016, it took us essentially four quarters to unwind whereas in this cycle it really happened in a quarter. North America is very challenged. I\u2019ll give you a little bit of color on the world areas now. North America is very challenged.  Obviously, the oil prices and what\u2019s happening in the marketplace is unsettling and it presents a huge challenge to the upstream business. We will see production quotas imposed as the Texas Oil Commission and others meet and vote later this morning. Rig count is down 35% in Western Texas in the last 30 days and our RFUs in the upstream business is down about 25%.  There are only 35 operating rigs left in Alberta and we believe production will be curtailed by at least 20% in North America. Downstream, refiners are continuing production as well. Some are shutting down units and other smaller refiners are shutting down completely. This is partially offset by strength in medical and life sciences as Pete pointed out.  We won a major biopharm job which we will revoke in May that we have a 100% team assigned, operating at about 2000 hours a week to deliver an FDA approved validated system in September. That is record time for \u2013 sustain that pharma plant. Let me turn to Asia. The good news is China\u2019s recovery is better than expected. We will beat the orders plan in April, significantly driven by semiconductor, and medical. The near-term demand in China is relatively strong as the economic stimulation takes hold and I\u2019ll show you the specific details on a monthly basis on China.  India is a bigger risk. As Michael pointed out with significant lockdowns across the country and more restrictive measures instituted today, making it increasingly challenging from a sales executing perspective. So we got to keep working that.  However in across Asia, customers are resilient and anxious to do business. But the restrictions are prohibitive at times on the sales side.  Let me turn to Europe. The Europe had a very good close to Q2 and we have very few cancelations to-date. Customers are working to seize aggressively and RFUs in total have dropped about 15%. Well, I\u2019ll give you an example to Southern Europe which is interesting. For us, Southern Europe is Italy, France, Spain and Portugal.  Arguably, the hardest hit part of the world when it comes to the virus impact. On average, we book $40 million per month in those four countries. We will book $38 million per month in April \u2013 in the month of April. That\u2019s less than \u2013 that\u2019s down less than 10%. Our Italian plants and suppliers are back on line and goods are flowing as the Port of Genoa is now reopened albeit very busy.  Turning to the Middle East. Very strong environment continues with strength in Saudi Arabia, offset by weaknesses in Iraq and Kuwait. The project funnel continues to move positively with Aramco remaining committed to their jobs and virtual meetings are taking place across the region that we have significant digital transformation wins as well.  And lastly, in Latin America, we have seen a significant impact particularly in Mexico. The Chile copper mining and Peru gold mining continue to be bright spots and Brazil outside of Petrobras, particularly at Modec continues to be a good story for us.  Turning to sales, the plan for Q2 is a positive five tenths. We were down 8%. As we pointed out, again, we will trough to 12% in Q3 and we will stay negative as planned here for five consecutive quarters.  At this point it\u2019s very important for me to highlight our backlog position. In the first half of 2020, we built $600 million of backlog predominantly across our final control, systems and measurement solutions business. The assumption in this plan is that we reduced backlog by $300 million in the second half of the year. That results in Q4 being down in the 8% range and 2020 being down in that 7% midpoint range.  If we can only convert a third of that backlog assumption meaning about a $100 million, Q4 will be down 12% and 2020 sales will be down approximately 8%. That\u2019s a sensitivity on the sales plan.  Let\u2019s turn to chart 29. The last portion of this chart is an exact replica of the chart I shared with you during our February Investor Conference. The 2023 peak margin plan I defined has $325 million of restructuring spend impacting 2300 salaried headcount and a 110 facility reductions yielding approximately $400 million of savings.  Focusing on 2020 specifically, we committed to spend a $177 million of restructuring. In the first half, we spent a $112 million including $83 million which we spent in Q1 and that was prior to our February meeting in New York. The team has identified an additional $53 million of restructuring bringing the total for 2020 to $230 million and driving annualized savings of $314 million.  This means that we have to execute $118 million of action in the second half, $85 million in Q3. This incremental plan impacts an additional 1100 individuals and results in $40 million of savings in the year, an additional $40 million of savings are generated by pullback of discretionary spending and other cost actions. In 2020 alone, we will impact over 8% of our salaried workforce.  Let\u2019s turn to chart 30. One of the most fundamental differences in our business today versus prior cycles is our KOB 3 position. We have essentially professionalized our MRO strategy since 2011 when we added significant focus to this program and have subsequently expanded KOB 3 as a percent of total sales by 20 points. Through March of 2020, KOB 3 makes up 60% of our global business, up 3 points from the 2019 historical high. The $120 billion installed base of our technology around the world has created tremendous trust and credibility with the customer base.  We are not relying on large orders through this challenging cycle, but we are significantly more dependent on day-to-day small orders that have become an increasingly important element to our business. Nowhere is this more relevant than in North America where KOB 3 now represents 67% of our sales.  Let\u2019s turn to chart 31 please. Most of the industry\u2019s focus have been on the dramatic cuts from the shale operators in North America and while we drive a large percentage of our oil and gas sales from North America, 44% as indicated on the chart, our exposure to the shale segment specifically of customers had only represented approximately 20% of total oil and gas sales.  While we do see capital spending coming down in all geography, we continue to win and execute critical projects around the world. The all logistics challenge is creating opportunities across the globe for terminals, terminal projects both modernizations and Greenfield developments and several funded new jobs in Mexico, in Abu Dhabi, and in China.  Additionally, upstream projects are still moving forward with limited new awards in international markets and projects in execution are progressing leveraging digital tools for remote collaboration for engineering and acceptance tests. So what does this mean for Emerson? One, a strong global team of sales and service continue to engage with our customer bases. In some cases in person, but also using the digital tool I described. Two, Emerson\u2019s digital transformation business is a competitive advantage for us. We have well developed connected solutions that enable customers to take people out of the process. Three, we are actively working with customers to schedule shutdown and turnaround activity into the fall season. Four, we have increased engagement with customers using our remote educational services. And lastly, we have developed targeted competitive displacement programs as many of our peers have extended product lead times eight to ten weeks or longer as they lack the regional manufacturing footprint capability.  Turning to Page 32. The project funnel currently sits at $7 billion versus $7.1 billion we communicated in February. The oil price shock has triggered projects to be deferred into 2021 or 2022. Approximately, $900 million of jobs have shifted to 2021. That is 2x the pace of FDI push outs that we have seen to-date.  Cancellations have predominantly occurred in North America and to help you bridge between the February meeting and what we see today as a business, we had approximately $135 million that we booked out of the funnel since February. We removed $203 million out of the funnel, $27 million of scope change occurred and we added approximately $270 million to the funnel.  The major reductions as I said were North America predominantly privately funded LNG jobs. The predominant additions were Modec, FPSOs, three shifts, Asia petrochemical jobs, predominantly in China, and BHP job in the Gulf of Mexico. Three large projects remain in the funnel. The Qatar NFE LNG; the Aramco crude to chemicals and the Ratnagiri Refinery in India, which is a GD between ADNOC, Aramco and Indian Oil. Let\u2019s turn to Chart 33. I would like to turn to a segment of our business that have significantly accelerated through this challenging time, a medical and life science business which will be close to $550 million in 2020 sales growing double-digits.  In the Medical it\u2019s predominantly in our discrete and industrial segment of business. This includes Branson ultrasonic welders that David highlighted the offset for medical PPE, ASCO medical regulators for application such as ventilators and oxygen therapy machine, pneumatic controls for lateral turning mattresses on intensive care beds. The business is projected to be up 40% in 2020 to $188 million.  The life science business is largely now process business, systems, measurements and final control where we have built a significant amount of technology around a leading DCS position in the life science market. This offering involves control as well as hygienic valves as they will instrumentation. Our position in the life science business is very strong. It goes back to the foundation of Delta V as a smaller IO system, best fitted for batch applications. Today, we have over 40% participation in what is a $0.5 billion life science DCS market that\u2019s two times greater than the next nearest competitor and we plan across the entire industry value chain, from development to production and sales.  Turning to chart 34. I would like to give you some perspectives of what we\u2019ve experienced in China over the fiscal year. This chart depicts orders and sales for 2020 by month. The markdowns in China were extended beyond Chinese New Year, but most of our operations resumed by February the 10th. We always expect that dip to occur in February as you saw there it occurred in 2019. Obviously, more stream this year.  By March, our orders were $125 million, down 90% versus 2019 and I expect it to be down 10% in April as well, although I could see us closing that gap. The acceleration in orders in the second half is driven by oil storage. Sinopec recently announced the construction of seven new tank farms, as well as petrochemical activity ramping up the elements like fiber production, a key feedstock for medical PPE. Much of this is visible in the Q4 plan.  Sales in March were down 22% versus 2019 despite our capacity being back to 96% by the end of the month. In April, capacity and manpower availability are both at 98% and sales are expected to be down 2% to flat versus 2019, but very good recovery as we get out March into April.  For 2020, right now I see orders projected to be slightly up at around 1% and sales to be flat versus 2019. Now I will turn it over to Bob Sharp. Thank you. Robert Sharp : Thanks, Lal. Like Lal did, I want to start by recognizing the team out there. Q2 ended very differently than what we thought starting with the China downturn in February coming out of \u2013 a delayed coming out of Chinese New Year and then going into March as we\u2019ll talk about, despite that we had a very strong quarter gross profit drove the nine tenths of adjusted EBITDA improvement. We held SG&A in line with sales even though again that sales drop by about 5% just in the last weeks and that was certainly a strong effort. As essential business, we keep running. Around 84% of the Commercial Residential Solutions employees are still going to work every day at the site. And that\u2019s what we need to do to produce and ship our product and I\u2019d certainly want to extend a special thanks to that groups and we\u2019ve taken many measures to make sure they are safe following the government and local health guidelines, as well as doing additional actions as well.  For the chart here, what I am showing, the sales and orders for our commercial residential largely go in line with each other. We are very much a book to ship business. But what I am showing here is our sales outlook for this year into next year and then I am going to use the financial prices as a reference, because there is not really any direct reference to what\u2019s happening right now.  But the closest thing I think we see is probably the financial crisis. So you can see going in last quarters have been kind of flattish if you will down a bit. You\u2019d expected it to be very similar to the rest of 2020 even a month or two ago and then things started changing pretty quickly. In Q2, China ended up being down 33%. The U.S. still held pretty closely around 3%, down and you can see now as the Covid effect has carried through into Europe and U.S. and other places the second half changes significantly.  Again, China was down 33%. We expect China to actually be moderating if you will and coming back. I\u2019ll show some more specifics on that. And then things are really going to turn where the U.S. and Europe in particular down significantly in the second half. So a bit of a flip flop. Certainly the two keys for us for the second half are going to be what China does from a trajectory standpoint and then U.S. summer is always a key variable for us with the heavy air condition problems that we have.  You can see right now, directionally, and it is certainly directionally because we are focused primarily on this period in this quarter more than anything. But going into 2021 as it follows similar downturns of the past, we would expect by the second half to be turning up and the magnitude that is certainly to be determined by a lot of things.  At the bottom again, the 2008 to 2010 reference. We had a little more growth going into the financial crisis up a couple percent being down. You can see we went down tens and twenty percents and four quarters and then had a pretty sharp snap back in 2010. There are some differences I think in this one, the housing starts in the U.S. went from about $2.5 million, down to $0.5 million in 2009 and was very much financial-oriented.  This is obviously a very different crisis. Certainly, substantial job loss right now, especially in the U.S. over $22 million jobs. So far we see that has been probably less housing-oriented kind of positions. But certainly as that plays out, that could also be a key factor as well.  So, again, at this point we are buckling down through a very challenging quarter that we are in. Still continued challenges in Q3 and now we\u2019ll watch out things develop and doing lot of external factors around the Covid virus as far as what\u2019s going to dictate for 2021 outlook.  The next chart I am showing is the \u2013 on the left is the exact chart I used in February for the Investor Meeting. You can see the peak plan summary, about $330 million of total actions, 500 salaried headcount actions on only about 8000 salaried headcount in this business.  That\u2019s a substantial percentage. A number of moves, the best costs, a number of factory changes. This is a very GP-oriented plan, so driven heavily by factory activities, automation and other programs and then certainly price cost is always a big factor for us.  On the right, you can see from an update. We beat this plan for H1 again despite the fact that the second quarter changed significantly than the last weeks. To this plan, we\u2019ve added 300 additional salaried actions. That\u2019s a combination of restructuring and then pulling open jobs and basically every possible move with respect to the workforce. We are very tight right now and the organizations are managing to that.  We are going to be using widespread furloughing in the business. It\u2019s an unusual practice for us, if you will, but partly because we expect this ideally to be a relatively short lived thing. Once the virus comes under control, we are trying to manage through by getting the cost down quickly in this half. Still have the opportunity with the workforce and next year \u2013 of course if next year changes we still have other levers to pull. But that\u2019s one where we are going after right now.  On top of the restructuring activities, there is also $31 million of other additional cost actions which is again basically all levers we can pull on the SG&A side. Our second half SG&A spend versus our original plan is now down over 10%. So we are working to adjust the volume decline.  And certainly as Mike mentioned, there is a lot of supplier internal customer and other disruptions to our operations as we work to keep running, work to keep our customers going and that\u2019s certainly going to be factor on the second half profitability and the GP as well. The next chart talks about China and you can see again, we had a very 2018 in China. It started turning down - the first half of last year was down 20 plus percent and we felt we were coming out of that with some ups and downs. But then, as you can see again, Q2 changed substantially. At the bottom, you see January was down 43%. That was largely a factor of the Chinese New Year timing versus last year. February, which normally would have been stronger turned into effectively an extended Chinese New Year by a matter of week in cases for some operations. So we also had a very significant downturn. March was a bit better, down 19%. April continues to improve within the 10%, 15% kind of a dynamic right now.  And as you can see, we do expect at this point to be at to steadily return again to May, June and then up above you can see in Q3 and Q4 and certainly under ideal conditions if you will or under the right conditions perhaps even turning positive in the fourth quarter. Down below on the left, there is a number of project investments going on right now across the provinces. You can see about $1 billion in total or close to that. Many projects, a lot of these effect buildings, a lot of these effect bus and rail where we have air conditioning and refrigeration. So we see this as a proxy. The channel partners we have in China have strong visibility on projects. The key thing is going to be the execution of them. Everybody is tight on cash right now. So everybody wants to release orders until they are getting paid by the customers and our channel is in that same condition as well.  So, again, the China, right now is playing out in this way and as \u2013 just as Lal mentioned, certainly, as we came out of the Chinese New Year, we had some challenges in the initial days, I\u2019ll say, but really by and large we\u2019re back to running very normally in China and as our customers and suppliers. And so we are hopeful that this is going to play out. We got a couple of charts here on Emerson\u2019s supporting the fight against Covid-19. Chart 39 from the commercial residential standpoint. Certainly, one of the things we have done is to help out particularly the first responders, the medical organizations, other care facilities.  We typically have a number of safety things in our plans, gloves, masks, goggles and things like that. And frankly, we\u2019ve done a lot of work to give away a lot of these things initially, particularly N95 and KN95 masks which are basically the Chinese standard of their N95 masks. We\u2019ve given away nearly 40,000 of these to many different care facilities around the U.S. and other countries as far as gloves and other things too. We are providing our home employees the surgical masks, cloth masks and other things. And from a prioritization standpoint, we are basically saying that the medical community need the N95s more than us. And then from our product standpoint, a number of good examples. On the right, our Cargo Solutions business, that device that you see keeps the temperature tracking and it also transmits cellular silicon transmitter conditions in a shipment.  A customer was trying to move some Covid test kit materials from Korea into the U.S. The first time they did this, they were all destroyed during the lay over due to freezing. And so, they contacted us on a Sunday for a Monday shipment. We gave \u2013 got some devices to them and helped to preserve the product as it came across to the U.S. In the bottom left, the Cold Chain business, Thermo Fisher, an important customer of ours use refrigeration for some of their Covid test stations, some of the testing environment and we are able to supply a number of those quickly. We got a number of other examples pop-up medical facilities for air conditioning and other things.  The bottom right shows in our Professional Tools business, the core of engineers in the U.S. pop-up care facilities in Denver and Miami, we provided a lot of equipment for them to be able to get that infrastructure established.  So, again, it really plays to the importance of understanding our products as a central business for society and again, it\u2019s something that we help \u2013 helps our employees understand why it is that we do need to coming to work every day, because we got a lot of important things we have to make sure we are providing to customers. I\u2019ll turn it over to Lal. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Bob. I want to share a few examples from an Automation Solutions perspective, as well and four specific examples of the efforts our teams are making to support the Covid-19 crisis response. Starting in drug development, I\u2019ve already mentioned a major pharmaceutical bio firm announced a significant expansion recently.  This is in response to a positive response of one of their drugs in Covid-19 treatment. I can\u2019t mention the name of the firm or the drug as we are in an NDA. However this contract is north of $20 million and will be book and ship this fiscal year.  In the testing realm, our Coriolis meters are being used for the precise filling of reagents in testing equipment. This will move over to medical PP&E. We have been awarded orders from Honeywell over the past five weeks for ultrasonic welders to be used in the manufacturing of medical masks. And lastly, in patient therapy, we have received nearly $20 million of orders for valves, manifolds to be used in oxygen therapy machines and sanitary regulator solutions for ventilator applications.  So very broad set of offerings that support the response that\u2019s occurring around the world. Thank you. David Farr : Thank you. Thank you, very much, Lal and thanks everybody again. We made the decision as we listen to our investors in the calls, in the sell-side analysts and also the buy side investors. So we felt that we needed to go little bit above and beyond normal in our communication. Don\u2019t expect this type of detail all the time. A lot of work goes into this. I just want you make sure. But I think it\u2019s important that our investors understand what we are living in day in and day out.  And again, I want to thank everybody both in this room, the entire OCE, the 15, 20 people that put up to me for the last 45 days and also the people around the world as both Bob and Lal and Mike and Frank have communicated. It takes a team effort and we\u2019ve divided and conquered and formed taskforce and worked this on a day-to-day, phase-to-phase basis.  And I want to make sure that everyone is recognized for that. I am doing a video again this afternoon. 2 O\u2019clock two videos, one for the employees and then also one for our website to thank everybody.  I also want to make one special emphasis on this. People know me quite well. In 2015, 2016, 2017, we went through a major repositioning effort and I made a very strong statement that we would not cut our dividend. We would not break our dividend history. I want to make sure people understand that. I am still the CEO.  I am not dead though people have tried to kill me. I am still quite strongly in charge and as long as I am here, our dividend will not be cut and we will maintain our dividend payments in history. We have the financial flexibility and capability to do that going forward. We also are looking clearly one of the things I want to make comment on is acquisition. We clearly see some opportunities that will start emerging and we want to make sure, we are strong, financially set and what the work that Frank is doing and the work everyone is doing right now gives us that flexibility to pickup unique opportunities like we did D&C many years ago.  But with that, I want to thank everybody in the situation room here. And I want to thank everybody around the world that has listened to us for Emerson and I am going to open the line and take Q&A. And we\u2019ll start. So off the back to the announcer. Since you wouldn\u2019t do a live \u2013 Saturday night live, this is live from St. Louis and the first question is coming from I guess, Mike Halloran. So let's open the lines, so Mike can ask the question. Operator : Yes. First question comes from Mike Halloran from Baird. Please go ahead. Mike Halloran : Hey. Good morning everyone and thanks. David Farr : Thank you, Mike. Good morning to you. Mike Halloran : So, first question, just some historical context on how you are looking at the oil and gas cycle here. Obviously, you've been through a few of these days. And certainly appreciate the slide that Lal put together and the amount of KOB 3 that\u2019s now in the portfolio. But how do you think about puts and takes structural concerns as you move forward gas versus liquid and how quickly you think your customers can start responding by putting more capital dollars and OpEx dollars back into the market? David Farr : Yes. So, Michael to give you some context, I\u2019ve been around a quite long time. I ran the process business back in 1996, 1997 when we had the financial crisis of Asia and the price of oil went below $10, almost went to zero. I think you are exactly right. We are going to see \u2013 I\u2019ll let Lal answer couple of things. We will see a structural change. I think we\u2019ll see an acceleration over time from liquid to gas. I think you are going to see a structural change in the power industry, a topic what\u2019s going to be used in the power industry generate energy and electricity. I think they\u2019ll take their time with this situation. I think some of our gas projects are still on the table.  I\u2019ll let Lal talk about Golden Pass plus the one going on in the Middle East right now. But the first thing right now, Mike, is they are going to hunker down and protect the cash. They are going to try and maintain the current liquid production, the revenue. So therefore they are going to have spend KOB 3 type of dollars and a little bit of KOB 2 dollars.  I think this been transitioned more out there in the 2023, 2024 and 2025 time period. Based on my historical knowledge of this, and I appreciate that. By the way, I am assuming Covid can\u2019t go over the virus. You get me sick. I\u2019d be very upset with you, Mike, especially since you're a Brewer fan, Milwaukee Brewer fan. So Lal, anything you want to add to that? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. Thanks, David. What we\u2019ve seen in recent announcements by the majors cutting CapEx down 22% versus 2019 those kinds of ranges. It is important to note that here in North America it\u2019s a heavily concentrated space. Approximately 50 players generate 80% of the oil production in the United States.  The other 20% is done by thousands of players. I think that 80 players will be \u2013 the 50 players, excuse me, will be very disciplined. As we go through this, the thousands, many of them will be in trouble as we go through it. So typically, when I think about the two segments, the downstream refining and the upstream oil and gas, I believe they have different economic cycles.  However, in this, both are grappling with that fundamental lack of demand. Mike, as you pointed out, refiners are facing difficult decisions. They are reducing utilization rates as I pointed out. Some of the idling units. And some are trying to figure out how do adjust maintenance and turnaround intervals to manage this tough environment.  For us, upstream is significantly more weighted to CapEx historically and refining has been more weighted to OpEx. That\u2019s one aspect where we see some difference. The other aspect is that we believe that the reining segment will rebound a little quicker as demand normalizes. However, oil \u2013 the oil production is more structurally impacted, I believe and that will be significantly more challenging because of this oversupply element that we have. That\u2019s how we see it right now in the two. But I think structurally upstream oil production will be more challenging cycle here. David Farr : One of the things we are doing, Mike, because you are exactly right. There is going to be some structural changes. We are starting \u2013 we are evaluating the organization too and we are putting investments and how we are going. As you well know, we can adjust our people, but we are working very quickly because clearly there is not going to be any major projects for a while in the liquids side.  There will be more in the gas side and obviously we are going to redirect our people and support the aftermarket business. So, a lot of adjusting going on by the world area people. Jamie, out in Asia Pacific, Vidya in the Middle East, we have obviously Roel in Europe, our leaders there are all adjusting because of the same issues that you bring up and it\u2019s going to be very fluid and live I think for two or three years. Mike Halloran : And David, to your point around gas, you are absolutely right. Golden Pass continues to move forward. That\u2019s said LNG jobs \u2013 Saudi\u2019s Marjan project is the offshore gas production continues to move forward and we continue to book the awards there. So I think they're looking long-term gas opportunity still as a dynamic they want to continue to fund. David Farr : Mike one more question. Sorry please. Mike Halloran : Yes. So that's actually a good segue. Then how do you think about the structural changes that we are seeing on that piece and what that means for the AS segment over time? And Hybrid discrete, some of these medical life science applications seem to doing very well in certainly better tale as we look forward, particularly as we basically step back and some more regionalization come on that side.  How quickly can you move the portfolio? What does it look like, obviously you don\u2019t stop supporting the KOB 3 piece and you still have a lot of breadth and depth there. But how quickly can you move and what you think about inorganically versus organically? David Farr : Yes, I think that we are \u2013 one of the things that Lal and his team are really \u2013 we are obviously looking at our internal investments. I\u2019ll answer the first and then Lal answer those two. But we are obviously changing our investments towards serving the more discrete marketplace. The other marketplace is not the liquid side, because I think the gas investments will continue to come back.  The aftermarket gas is very, very strong and then it will be a liquid but it will be changed as you are saying. So you are going to see that we continue to invest at higher levels around the areas that are in the hybrid space, the discrete space of the space both from an acquisition standpoint and also this internal development.  We have a lot of projects underway right now working clearly within the discrete space, within the systems space that move outside the oil in that marketplace. We are also looking potentially some acquisitions, can we shake out some acquisition that are little more software based along those lines.  So, Mike, I think you are right and obviously, as we\u2019ve seen in every other structured time like this, our liquid business will be less and our other business will be higher. So that percentage will continue to drop. So if you think about the revenues and you think about the business that we have today, and it\u2019s going to continue to shipped away from the liquid side, we are not going to walk away from these important customers that we support in the oil and gas area.  These are very important customers. The industry is dependent on our technologies. But you are right, we will reallocate some of the new innovation around the other areas and our portfolio continue that mixing away from the oil and gas. So anything else you want to add to Lal? Lal Karsanbhai : Just two things, David. We made significant efforts both organically and inorganically in developing our portfolio around the discrete space, both with acquisitions in Europe and internal investments in that business around our core ASCO technology. And there is a significantly longer runway to continue to drive that.  The two other areas, David that I am particularly focused on from a diversification perspective are in the Hybrid segment, life science, particularly meaning as we touched on Mike, in the power segment. I think there are opportunities to expand our power market beyond our traditional generation control system into other areas. David Farr : And I think that \u2013 will you Mike, also like to add on up in Minneapolis, right now they are working on a lot of sensors for the hybrid life sciences, food and beverage space which is important area. So, the next question, come on. Operator : Next question comes from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicole DeBlase : Yes. Thanks. Good morning Dave. David Farr : Good morning, Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : So, I just wanted to ask about margins in the second half of the year. It looks like you guys are embedding decremental is getting about worst in the third quarter despite the fact that I would suspect restructuring payback is stepping up. So if you could speak to decremental margins as well as the expectation for restructuring payback? David Farr : Yes. I think the big issue right now, Nicole, is in the second quarter why our detrimental margin was so much better is obviously we had a lot undergone in the first quarter and then the drop-off in the sales be it significant, but not the same level we are talking about in the third quarter. So, right now, the acceleration and the decline of our sales are overwhelming basic to the restructuring we\u2019ve done in the first half and the incremental restructuring we have going on at this point of time.  We are still looking at 12 months left on the total pipe. We are also looking at some longer term ones that we are doing relative to our international markets. So we can sort of set ourselves up for a better 2021 and 2022. But the third quarter in particular is really \u2013 is because the drop off you see in those sales, I think when we drop-off $1 billion something in the third quarter sales, $700 million.  It\u2019s just overwhelmed everything we\u2019ve done at this point of time. So we\u2019ve been a little bit more cautious on that. But we are still looking at a very good payback of 12 months and from that standpoint. Very focused on that, but I just don\u2019t see us overwhelming that drop-off in sales has hit us so hard in April, May and June. Nicole DeBlase : Okay, fair. That makes sense. And then, just piggybacking on to that question, is there any big difference in the margin expectation by segment or were both phased similar decremental as in the second half just thinking about the fact that most of the restructuring spend has been focused on AS? David Farr : Bob, why don't you answer first? What's your decremental second half right now? You are going to be close to 30. Robert Sharp : Yes, we are going to deleverage around 30% order of magnitude that\u2019s where sales down and went to the teens. So it\u2019s a bit of a sales difference in the second half between the two platforms. But as Dave mentioned that magnitude of sales decline, even with the very strong SG&A reduction versus last year, and certainly many activities in the plants.  The deleverage of volume, as well as again the Covid-19, which is very disruptive to the plants right now is going to be very challenging. David Farr : From a productivity. I think the other thing I want to add, Bob, you are still trying to target some EBITDA margin improvement for the whole year, even with the down sales we are looking at. So that\u2019s still the case. Robert Sharp : Adjusted EBITDA in total for the whole year we are looking to hold versus last year. But we are going to be hurt at this point. Yes, there is going to be very strong for volume decline, but it\u2019s going to be difficult at this point to be up. David Farr : And the big issue and I\u2019ll let Lal answer to, Nicole, the big issue right now, the plant, some plants will operate for a day, two days and then get shutdown as we have to clean. And that productivity impact is very, very hard to overcome in which safety within our facilities is very, very important. It\u2019s frustrating. You have a situation often you have to shut down, then you got your people back up.  So it\u2019s another hand tied behind your back. But overall I think with that all that situation is doing pretty well. So, Lal, anything you want to add? Robert Sharp : Yes. Thanks David. Hi, Nicole. The third quarter is clearly our most challenging quarter within leverage rates in the 44% range for us. That\u2019s driven by predominantly two factors. One being the North America impact which is most significant in the third quarter accelerates from March into Q3 and the book to ship business\u2019 impact. For the short cycle businesses in our instrumentation and KOB 3 in final control being impacted.  Those are higher margin businesses than some of the longer cycle businesses that we do have. Things do get better for us sequentially into Q4 from a deleverage perspective and we fall back into the 2020 on a pure EBIT basis, which is more normalized. But the third we think a significant hit. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. Thanks guys. David Farr : Thank you very much Nicole. See you soon. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Yes. Good morning. David Farr : Good afternoon or good morning, Andrew. I guess, it is morning. Andrew Obin : Yes. David Farr : I just use this morning stuff. Don\u2019t get used for either. Go ahead. Andrew Obin : Just some the questions. Looking at the comparison you guys making with 2008, 2009 and I understand the bottoms up back that the company is better. But it seems that the GDP forecasts for 2020 are going to be weaker than what we even saw in the great financial crisis.  Yes, your revenue performance seems to be better than in the financial crisis. Is that all driven by just changes in the portfolio or are there other assumptions from a macro perspective embedded there as well? David Farr : The number one issue, Andrew, is we went into the financial crisis wanting hot, strong. We are very strong. We are growing double-digits. So that was the biggest \u2013 so we are in a growing curve and then we got hit and we dropped hard of that hit. As you well know we were structured this year for a basically a flat year.  We had a couple \u2013 last year it\u2019s a bit bottom, this is flat to slightly down. Lal was way up what he thought it was originally. So we are going into the cycle differently and the second thing is we are differently structured from a mix of the business since the last cycle. But the big issue is when we went to that one, we are growing very strongly and then the bottom fell out.  This one we were ready for it. The bottom had already started collapse last year. That\u2019s the biggest difference, Andrew. Andrew Obin : And just a second question. In terms of restructuring, you are talking about spending more money, but can you just talk in terms of logistically what is that you are doing in 2020 now that a couple of months ago you didn\u2019t think you would have to or you couldn\u2019t do it. Are there opportunities to move fast or is it just you are being more aggressive on footprint and if you just us more detail as to specifically what if you could share that publicly. Thank you. David Farr : Yes. So, there is two avenues here. One we are \u2013 what we are trying to do is accelerate the programs sort of the fixed cost programs, the facility programs that we had built more into 2021. We are trying to accelerate those into the second half of 2020. So we can get those done sooner because when the spike does come back, we want to have those new facilities up and running at lower cost structure.  Secondly, we are being a little bit more aggressive on some of these consolidations and how we do them and how fast we get them done from that perspective. And the third thing is, as I said earlier, both the corporate and the two platforms, we are looking at the structural of the overall company and what layers we can take out and what layers we don\u2019t necessarily need more as we learn how to run the company in a different world which we are right now. So those are things we are doing and we are just looking at everything very carefully and sort of \u2013 if we don\u2019t need it, we are not going to do it. And that\u2019s from that perspective. So that\u2019s what\u2019s going on a lot different view of that as we go through this pandemic war. I think, Lal you want to add? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. Thanks, David. Obviously, on the facility rationalization, it is dependent on us building the best cost sites. So that we can execute some of those plans. They are underway, that\u2019s obviously building plants this time accelerating as best we can. So to David\u2019s point, a lot of what we\u2019ve identified Andrew incrementally has been purely around volume related headcount decisions on what we do and don\u2019t do and then identifying further delayering opportunities across the businesses.  Those are the \u2013 those two categories. As we talked about it New York, Andrew the quicker the payback on restructuring and quick as to execute and that\u2019s what we leaning on very hard here in 2020 as we accelerate this second half restructuring. David Farr : Bob, do you want to add? Robert Sharp : Well, I\u2019d just say that, our peak plan did not have things like wage freezes and cuts. Certainly, discretionary, I think most everybody else is doing the same thing is practically non-existence. And frankly, as we are just going into the organization at a level, part of it\u2019s volume-related but a lot of the SG&A isn\u2019t necessarily easy to do with volume.  So we are making some tough choices right now and positions that we hope to at least be able to work have without for at least a year or so to get the payback on it. But some of this stuff when we do get volume we\u2019ll certainly come back and it\u2019s \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s really part of the peak plan. It\u2019s part of dealing with just a very dramatic sales cycle we hope in the last two ones.  But again, the operational side, the plants that\u2019s all going. There is not a whole lot more we can do that will affect the second half of this year. Even in the manufacturing salary, rents and costs, we are not returning over at this down right now and trying to deal with a pretty dramatic volume slide here quickly. Does that answers? Andrew Obin : Yes. Just a question, have you essentially your definition of what low-cost facilities are in this environment given this fracturing of global supply chains that people talked about? David Farr : We use the word best cost and the answer is no. We always look at evaluation relative to logistics. If you think about our regional strategy, we think about logistics, supply chain. I think there fundamentally will be some changes as people look at rebalancing that matrix site that we use and we did a rebalancing about five or six years or seven years ago. We will take a look at that as we go forward here.  But from our perspective, we are \u2013 we tweak that matrix on a constant basis. We\u2019ll tweak it again at the end of 2020. But right now the definition of best cost has not changed, no. Andrew Obin : Really appreciate it. Thanks a lot. Operator : Next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead, Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning, and thanks for giving the details. And morning. Maybe just a first question, David, looking at Slide 24, and you got that scenario there is a big dip in fiscal Q3 and then staggering back towards a sort of flattish line a year out. Maybe just help us understand within each of the two main segments which end-markets do you think will lead that recovery?  And which ones might be lag on, understand that maybe upstream CapEx is definitely a laggard that Lal had called out. But maybe any other color across the two platforms of the slope of end-market trajectory? David Farr : Yes. I think if you \u2013 I\u2019ll comment and I\u2019ll let both these guys comment on the specific businesses and what will be different. And clearly the liquid side of Lal\u2019s business is going to be very slow. I think you are going to see starting in the first half of next year some companies look at bringing some facilities back in the United States. So they\u2019ll be spending around pharmaceutical, and medical, they\u2019ll be spending around some of the chemical side and the materials that go into that space. I think you are going to see \u2013 the only laggard we see probably early on will be the liquid side on the new contract \u2013 in the new business.  Historically, that would lag with this type of shock. I would also probably be cautious about the gas. I think the gas capital investments will probably be a little bit slow recovering back. But the rest of the 80% of the business that we look at, I think will start bouncing back pretty quickly as they go through their own matrix and see where they are making stuff and how they rebalance that.  But the power industry, I think will continue to spend as it is right now. If I look at the food and beverage, I look at the chemical, all these guys are reevaluating those \u2013 their spending. So, I think those are \u2013 they are going to come back. Liquids and the gas side that would worry about which is about 20% of the total business. Anything else you want to add to that? Lal Karsanbhai : David, just very quickly. Obviously in the 60% KOB 3 business, Julian, that\u2019s a lot of day-to-day small orders. Essentially, what that 60% define is what is required from an automation perspective to keep the plants running. Be it a pharmaceutical plant, a refinery or coal powered fired station. So, it\u2019s that that we are focused on. I agree with David as this comes back it will be predominantly on that \u2013 not be in that production, but that will lag. It will be more downstream as we hear. But we are currently already scheduling SPOs shutdown turnaround activity into the fall season. That\u2019s across the broad scale of process industries and power. That we\u2019ll see accelerate and return very quickly as people allow background sites. And we should see the benefit of that. David Farr : But you are going to see a lot of the \u2013 as the White House, that I am sure every governments around the world look at as all the areas that went into the healthcare, the medical, the type of chemicals, whatever they need, the pharmaceutical, I guarantee they are going to look at how do you \u2013 around the world, not just in the U.S. but also Europe and Asia they are going to look at.  Okay, where do we need to make those investments and that\u2019s what\u2019s help drive a company like Emerson back in the early 2021 time period. Bob anything you want, as you see a change coming back? Robert Sharp : Yes, certainly for us, certainly a key leading end was obviously China and that\u2019s also we anticipate being a key as far as coming out of it as they work on stimulating the economy. Construction, both in terms of real activity, if you will, but also especially the channel just getting very cautious about carrying inventory snaps very quickly on us.  And depending on the sell-through picture that could come out \u2013 that can come back quickly as well. Cold chain right now, again the restaurant industry is largely frozen in the United States or on hiatus. Even supermarkets which were all realizing a critical infrastructure are very limiting as far as really in the sites.  So they are very careful about doing any project activity right now. And then again, certainly, if the general customer both individuals as well as companies freezing right now with uncertainty about what\u2019s going to happen.  And then, again coming out to China, and certainly again for us the summer cycle in the U.S. with air conditioning is going to be quite important and that we always watch as the spring development as the heat develops that\u2019s going to be a key factor. And it might be a more of a replacement market here than a\u2026 David Farr : Yes, they certainly talked about replacement, but about 85% of our business is already on to that replacement anyway. So certainly the housing, new housing will have some factor and whether people do require \u2013 repair their systems, replacement matters of that too, although margins on the repair side, the compressors are quite good. So, there is certainly some mixed out if it gets down into component repairs. Thank you. Julian, anything else? Julian Mitchell : Just a quick one. I mean, I know that you always looked sort of further out into the medium-term. So, maybe whenever we come out of this downturn, would you expect anything different about the incremental margins whenever we come out of this slump versus, say, your experience in 2017 or 2010 and 2011? David Farr : Well, I mean, from the standpoint of \u2013 we are not backing off our peak margin plans. So, obviously as we come out of the incremental margins should be better in the near term because we are taking fundamental structural changes to the company and we are evaluating all the touch points between the two businesses and the corporate entity.  So I would say, structural cost will be lower as we come out of this and that will be a good thing and the key is for you is for the next CEO is to make sure that he or she does not allow those structural cost to come back in. But I would say that, as we try out of this thing incremental margins could be better for us. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. David Farr : Thank you, Julian. Next. Operator : Next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning guys. Dave thanks for all the color here. David Farr : Good morning, Andrew. How are you doing my friend? Where are you hiding these days? Are you hiding in some place? Are you bunkered? Andy Kaplowitz : Hiding in Jersey. Hiding in Jersey. Very exciting place to hide. But\u2026 David Farr : Very good place. Andy Kaplowitz : Exactly. By the way, let me ask you about China, just in the context of obviously down 20% in AS in Q2 and 30% in CNRS. So how much did you use China a roadmap for Covid-related impacts across the rest of the company where you are thinking about your guidance?  Because you don\u2019t seem to be guiding to that kind of impact for the rest of the world in the second half. Is that mostly because of the expected China recovery, or are there any other geographies that are hanging in there better than China? And then can you give us your take on the shape of China\u2019s recovery?  I know you gave us lot of color. Do you think it\u2019s ultimately U, L? What do you think there, Dave? David Farr : China recovery is going to be a more of a V shape. And you could just quickly say I think it\u2019s going to be sharper for a while, a little bit more flattened for Bob and the reason for it is, it allows businesses, I mean from a nationalistic approach, China is investing in things that will help them as a country, be it the medical area, be it the power area, be it the other different energy areas, given the fact that building tank farms to buy $10 price of oil.  I mean, China, for a while business is going to stack much faster. Now, I don\u2019t think the rest of the world is just \u2013 I\u2019ll talk to Lal\u2019s business first. I don\u2019t think the rest of this world will snap this way. China has a little bit different agenda from the standpoint how they control the economy. I think the other economies will have a slower come back from the standpoint of how they open up.  We just look at our measured opening that we are going to have inside the United States. I see the same thing happening in the middle of Asia, in the Middle East, Asia South and Middle East and also in Europe. So, I \u2013 what we are mapped out here, Andrew is a different a slower recovery within the markets outside of China. I also see that I look at Latin America. I think Latin America is going to struggle on the political leadership and also the financial wherewithal is not that good.  On Bob\u2019s business, clearly, historically, Bob\u2019s business, he is coming back quite strongly in Asia, or China and Asia. Not snapping as Lal\u2019s because money is being more allocated to where they want to put the money. But still it\u2019s going to be a pretty strong recovery. And I don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t see that type of recovery in the other markets.  So we see more of a flattened slow recovery. Now the one thing that Bob has historically is he get snapped, as he has a chart he shows historically, maybe by the third or fourth quarter of next year, he could see things accelerate and it goes back to the distribution channel which we are liquidating because the financial wherewithal of that channel and then also may see some strengthening that can stack. He actually historically has a stronger snap.  And so, we\u2019ve not factored in any snaps other than in China, because it\u2019s just \u2013 I don\u2019t see the other markets behaving like China at this point in time Andrew. Andy Kaplowitz : China is definitely been very proactive about getting businesses, getting the back going which is not necessarily the case you see in other countries and both in terms of getting plants operational, getting people back to work and also then on a stimulus side of injecting things with programs.  So, I think you are just seeing a lot more organized collective effort, if you will, to get the economy back running and then we are going to see in the number of countries right now? David Farr : Bob, do you want to add anything? Robert Sharp : Yes, just very quickly. Obviously, China doesn\u2019t have the production elements of our marketplace. Europe is the other area that has very little production left than \u2013 has been depressed for a long time and we are seeing Europe being more resilient than the Americas for example, as well. So those will be two nuances on that. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks. That\u2019s helpful guys. And then, Dave, there has been a lot of talk. I mean, you mention about reassuring and how that might impact taking multi-national companies. You did talk about your strong local-for-local strategy. So maybe talk about how your supply chain has been impacted, little more color there and how you might benefit us?  In fact, we do see more emphasis on localization of supply chain. And then conversely, how much concern do you have about being a big industrial player in China if we do have more call for nationalism over the next couple of years? David Farr : Well, nationalism, it has been calling on now. It started back about five or six years ago. But nothing new, it\u2019s obviously just escalated a little bit higher that has been going on for some time. I totally believe based on what we are seeing in our customer base in both the chemical industry, what we see in obviously the food and beverage, the hybrid, the medical industry. We are seeing a push to our rebalance some of these supply chains and also where they make stuff. The fact that Honeywell is opening a mask \u2013 a plant in Rhode Island, a mask plant in the Arizona, the fact that we are seeing some first vaccine production that we are working on right now and going after to be in the United States.  I think the legislation has to be changed to protect the medical and pharmaceutical industry and the vaccine industry. But I think you are going to see that. I think clearly, the negative side of that will be companies like Emerson and the multinationals that we serve the global industries, we are going to have to work that issue. But it\u2019s not going just with the U.S. I think Western Europe will be the same way, Andrew. I think you are going to see Western Europe, be it the French, the German, the Italians, the Spanish, the Belgians, they are going to look at what happened and what they could depend on, be it the Asians or be it an American and they are going to say okay, we need to redo some stuff here.  So I think this is going to happen globally over the next two or three years and I think the good solid global industrial companies which you guys all know about, many of you follow I think will benefit from this. I think the guys are \u2013 the companies are still going through massive changes are going to struggle. There is going to be pluses and minuses, in the end I think I put a plus on our side. I do have a couple negatives as you point out and we\u2019ll have to manage those accordingly. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks, Dave. Stay well. David Farr : You too. All the best to you, Andrew. Especially in New Jersey. I think I like my hand better in St. Louis. Andy Kaplowitz : I hear you there. David Farr : Okay. Next. Operator : Next call comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Farr : Good try. Good try. That\u2019s damn close. Good try. You want to pronounce your last name for this guy? Josh Pokrzywinski : Yes, I hope it was, eight out of twelve letters \u2013 Dave. So\u2026 David Farr : Eight out of ten. Oh, that\u2019s pretty good. I loved it. Josh, you did got the humor award this morning. Okay, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : I appreciate it. We talked a lot about the supply chain. Anything in your own supply chain, your own sourcing that you are looking at saying, gosh, this is gotten too long and much we manufacture locally.  We are having to cross a few too much \u2013 few too many borders to get components or other kind of sub-assembly, looking less at your customers and kind of more yourself as the purchaser? David Farr : Yes, the answer is yes. And so, what we are going through right now is the first wave we obviously hit was the China wave. And as we looked at the China impact at the end of January and early February, we are looking obviously, what's happening towards right now as we look at the India, Malaysia, Mexico, U.S. what we have is a very good enterprise risk strategy driven by the businesses and evaluated through our audit side and through the audit committee under Lisa Flavin and the audit committee.  We will go through this process most like I asked the audit committee yesterday to wait a little longer, probably it will be more like August this year. I want things to stabilize. But we are going to look at things like, how did our supply network do from a financial crisis standpoint. Do they have the money?  Did we have to help them? Which ones we are going to keep up for this as we ramped up and down. So I think that from, as we look at right now, Josh, we are not going to be getting fundamental changes. As you know, our strategies we have multiple suppliers. But the big issue for the first time we are seeing not just one or two countries closing down, we have three countries closing down.  And so, what we are going to have to do is evaluate this from an economic standpoint and a enterprise risk standpoint is looking at this model and say okay, do we have to have four. And so, those are things that we will do. Nothing right now I am more interested in stabilizing and then recovering. But we do know what happens with and I guarantee there will be changes as we leave this year on a calendar year basis and as we move into 2021 on a calendar year basis.  So, I think it\u2019s little too earlier at. We\u2019ve been able to overcome it and in the mean time I do know we will make some changes as we go forward here in late 2020 and in early 2021. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. I appreciate that. And then, just as I think about some of your kind of longer cycle customers or folks who don\u2019t make decisions likely, I\u2019d imagine that the speed of which doesn\u2019t happened is maybe hard to kind of calibrate what they want to do, just show up one morning and kind of erase the zero from the budget and go forward.  At what point do you think you get clarity from your customers, i.e. they\u2019ve had enough time to scrub everything and get back to you. So I would imagine you are not quite in that moment yet where \u2013 what they want to do? David Farr : Josh, this one is a lot faster and the reason \u2013 this one is a lot faster. I mean, is it a 100% no, but it\u2019s a lot higher percent than you think. And the reason for it goes back to what Frank covered is the liquidity in financial crisis. So, they really had to jump on this thing very early on in February and March.  Now will there be some changes? The answer is yes. But I think that you missed \u2013 you don\u2019t represent as well that if you don\u2019t think that these guys have made some fundamental changes. We are living in it daily. At the OCE, we get together at 2 O\u2019clock every day. The OCE downstairs is the big board room and we are spread out and both of us, both Lal and Bob were talking from a customers\u2019 input.  So these guys are moving much faster. So, maybe the last pieces will be finalized as they get finished out this reporting this quarter. But if I look at our customer base from a financial standpoint, they had to take action very, very quickly both from internally, cash flow generation and then also what we are looking at from a financial market standpoint.  So this one is a little bit faster pace and being together allowed us to make some adjustments as much faster. But I would say these guys are further down that pipe than you think. And probably this quarter, we'll finalize it. Bob, anything you want to add on that? Robert Sharp : No I think that\u2019s right. And a lot of that is because nobody really knows what to expect. So in that event they freeze quickly. Whether it\u2019s a small customer or a large customer, everybody is freezing very bad. David Farr : So, I think don\u2019t underestimate this. It\u2019s happened pretty quickly. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. I appreciate the color. I\u2019ll leave it there. Stay safe. David Farr : Okay. It\u2019s good. Next. Operator : Next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. David Farr : Thanks, Scott. That was easier name to pronounce. Steve Tusa. Steve Tusa : Sorry. I was just out fixing myself in dinner. On slide.. David Farr : You are facing yourself at dinner? Right, you mean, lunch or breakfast? What did you mean? Steve Tusa : Well, I am just saying this is a pretty comprehensive conference call you are having here. It\u2019s been a while \u2026 David Farr : Oh, you have to go to the bathroom? Oh okay. You are complaining. Oh, god, Tusa. Steve Tusa : I was going to ask about the sequential downtick from June to July on Slide 34, but I will leave that. I\u2019ll take that offline, ask Pete about that one. You have a modest sequential downtick there. Okay, so, anyway we really appreciate all the detail. Most companies are withdrawing guidance. Obviously, you guys have given a lot of detail here. Just a very simple question. How much of this cost save? I think you said $46 million of the cost saves have been booked kind of in the first half. How much do you have queued up for the second half? And then how much do you have visibility on for 2021? David Farr : We do have the numbers here. Let\u2019s work this number and work it. We basically \u2013 what we showed the Board last week, Steve, is the second half, quarter-by-quarter and then also what we showed in them is the first half next year. So Lal, what do you have queued for savings to fall into this at this point in time? Lal Karsanbhai : What goes into the plan, just to kind of reset, we spent $112 million in the first half. We recognized savings from the restructuring and other activities in the first half of $46 million. David Farr : Okay. Lal Karsanbhai : Okay. Second half restructuring will be a $118 million. We combined savings in the year and \u2013 excuse me, in the second half of $186 million. David Farr : So, the incremental would be about a 140 something? And then what you are running out \u2013 what did you tell the Board going into the first half of next year? Clearly, has to make\u2026 Lal Karsanbhai : I do not changed off the plans from February. There will be runrate obviously impacts, because what we are doing incrementally this year. David Farr : The big savings allows them in the second half and then will go into the first quarter next year. Steve Tusa : Okay. Thanks. So there will be some carryover into \u2013 so did you pull all of that into this year or you still have a pretty decent year-over-year kind of variance heading into 2021? David Farr : What you saw on the board, 10 and 21. Lal Karsanbhai : Right, I will share with you \u2013 well, I did not go into 2021 spend, but our spend in 2021 is expected to be $83 million. David Farr : $83 million. Lal Karsanbhai : I have not changed that number. David Farr : $83 million. So, we\u2019d accelerate some stuff in and therefore on the $83 million you\u2019ll have \u2013 they will still have some savings although that\u2019s going to be dollar-to-dollar because they are going to be some longer term ones. But it will still have some carry over. So, we\u2019ll probably have another $80 million in the whole year next year. Lal Karsanbhai : Just to give you a perspective, David, there was $55 million in 2019. David Farr : Yes. Lal Karsanbhai : There will be $230 million in 2020. David Farr : Yes. Lal Karsanbhai : And then another $83 million in 2021. David Farr : Yes. We\u2019ll get dollar for dollar savings pretty quickly in that. Robert Sharp : And for commercial residential, for the restructuring programs we are doing this year, about 60% of the savings benefit we will capture this year. So we got carry over about 40% and then of course we had to hold another set of actions in 2021, for 2021 and beyond that will lay into that as well. Steve Tusa : Okay. Robert Sharp : Steve, I think we\u2019ll still have savings coming into the first half of next year. But once we will have to offset in the first half of the year will be things like the salary cut, because we will institute that. So those numbers will have to come back. That\u2019s doing around $6.5 million for the second half. So $3.5 million per quarter.  The salary planning numbers will hit us all for next year too, because that will roll back out. So, furloughing, there is a number of things again we are doing in the second half to be dramatically if you will that depending on how the sales curve returns. Certainly, some of this thing to return. David Farr : Yes, the key thing is prior bridge is much of the cost right now and then real cost savings will flow in as we finish this year. But I like the pace right now. I look at what\u2019s going on with the decremental and inefficient plants and the savings are flowing through pretty nicely. Steve Tusa : And why in the background mind do I feel, there was a $70 million number you threw out there earlier in the year and said you had embedded some of that. I mean these numbers seems substantially higher than that. I thought a little more is going to be pushed into kind of 2021 or do you just kind of accelerate those? David Farr : Yes, we had a 35 number for last year. I think they are bigger numbers now, Steve, because what\u2019s happened is we\u2019ve done a lot more short-term numbers and I think that the numbers that we shared with you in February are very similar to this. But they are obviously higher now because we have more savings and we are trying to accelerate. So, the costs are going up. But the savings are going up at the same time.  We\u2019ll have probably more carry over because we are doing more action right now. I mean, the issue is we are living in a dark period right now that we have to figure out how to drive our cost down. And that\u2019s where we are at this point. So the numbers are bigger than I talked about earlier. But it\u2019s always hard to tie back to other things I\u2019ve said over the phone. Steve Tusa : Right. And then just one quick one. Yes, I just wanted to kind of nail down, kind of the quarterly sequencing, because you gave the third quarter and the fourth quarter, and the fourth quarter obviously is a step-up sequentially on an EPS basis. Is that essentially kind of the mechanics of basically revenue stabilization and then all this kind of cost-cutting flowing through that you get.  You don\u2019t see that in the second quarter, because of how hard revenue is going down, but you really see it in kind of the fourth quarter. Just trying to reconcile this $0.60 moving to kind of the $0.80 to $0.90 or whatever it is in the fourth quarter? David Farr : 100% correct, Steve. I think that, right now, we started, the team started working extremely hard about March 10th and we started taking, okay guys, we got something coming out of here. And so, what you are seeing right now is this wave is hitting us a lot harder as we saw around the world. So we\u2019ve taken actions and we fundamentally believe will stabilize by the time we get into June.  Business will still be down, but our cost actions are happening and while as the volume stabilizes we will \u2013 at a obviously lot more level our savings will start flowing through. That\u2019s why we have that stepping up. The other thing I\u2019ll make a comment to you \u2013 I think you all know is that, we\u2019ve always had a variable performance share program going back since early 1970.  It started that we showed on Chart 8 when we showed the first quarter we got hit very hard by $0.10 because the stock price is going up. On Chart 8 of \u2013 on the first quarter report in February, this quarter what\u2019s happened is obviously the stock dropped dramatically a lot of wealth has been locked \u2013 locked off of our shareholder base including people like me and Frank and Bob and Lal.  But the variable plan obviously is that lot lower cost. So therefore we got a benefit this quarter. We are assuming our stock price will stabilize and start coming back up. So we are factoring a little bit of recovery. So we will have a negative number based on right now in the second half of the year. We\u2019ve always had a variable plant and we mark-to-market as you all know and we\u2019ve pointed out over the times. Steve Tusa : Got it. Your dog is probably not too happy about that one. Thank you, Dave. I appreciate it. David Farr : He's getting food right now. So don\u2019t worry about it, Robert Sharp : He likes the home quarantine. David Farr : He likes home quarantine. He got lot more place on the bed. Operator : The next question comes from Robert McCarthy from Stephens. Please go ahead. Robert McCarthy : Good morning, Dave and team. Thank you for all the details. David Farr : Good morning, Rob. Where are you holding up? Where are you hiding? You are not.. Robert McCarthy : Cambridge Massachusetts. Rejected three times, but they couldn\u2019t keep me out. So\u2026 David Farr : You guys got still lot of activity going on right now. I don\u2019t know if I am going to want you talking to me. You could be fast in stuff\u2026 Robert McCarthy : I think No, I think Elizabeth Warren is going to erect a guillotine and start taking out anybody over a $100,000. But I digress. David Farr : Well, thank, you don\u2019t make a $100,000. You should be safe because you don\u2019t make $100,000. Robert McCarthy : Yes, no. I know. I work for peanuts. You know that. So, in any event, expanding upon Mr. Tusa's excellent inquiry as always. The \u2013 I wanted to ask a little bit about the underlying cadence of at least the near-term. Obviously, you sit on the one of the committees that was \u2013 just announced the committee to reopen the economy.  I think you are part of the industrial working group. So I don\u2019t want to prejudge the recommendations you are making there and I better be careful because my monthly guy writes my checks. The gentleman who owns my firm is on that committee as well. I wanted to get a sense on all seriousness of how we think about the near-term short cycle in North America?  How do you think about what is a return to at least economic normalcy? People getting back to work. Obviously, we\u2019ve heard a lot about kind of a red, blue state divide here and I don\u2019t want to get into a big political discussion despite my earlier rhetoric.  But I do want to get a sense of how you are thinking about the industrial short cycle plays out in North America and perhaps Bob can amplify some of those comments, what\u2019s embedded in your guidance as we roll it out going forward? David Farr : I mean, I think what we see right now is that, the business layers, a lot of political leaders are starting to realize the tax revenue shortfall. The cost of this of shutting down the economy is enormous and they are starting to see \u2013 they are starting to it here in this town. The medical professions are having to lay people off and cut costs because all the businesses disappeared revenue and other than this the crisis around Coronavirus. And the same thing in the business world. So I think that we are all fighting to save our lives as companies and institutions. A lot will not make it. So, from my perspective, the push forward is trying to get the economy open and get business open. We can do this safely. We\u2019ve learned a lot from how this isolation and how we go about this and how we work together both from a company standpoint and the geopolitical standpoint.  I watch politicians and business leaders, business leaders are business leaders. There has been a lot more collaboration than the press would ever, ever, ever talk about. And so, I see right now to be honest, Rob, I think you are going to see the next two quarters are going to be pretty tough for America.  There is a lot of things have been stopped and slow down. There is a lot of concern even in our workforce of coming back to work and being exposed to this because people look at this as like it\u2019s a killing zone if you leave your house. And so, I think that, so we are factoring in the U.S. right now is a very, very weak third and fourth quarter.  We are not looking for much recovery here and I think that we are going to see the recovery happening internationally first. And I think that\u2019s what we are starting to see already in the month of April. So, I think you are going to see a very gradual get back to work. I think that hopefully, we\u2019ll start seeing some travel come back in.  Thank, we're not in the travel industry. I don't know how they are going to recover here for a while. But this is going to be a very slow recovery and the money is being put out there. But the reality is so much wealth and so much you get on this wealth has been lost that there is not enough money in Washington to flood this world to bring it back.  So we just got to get people back to the work making things and generating, and that\u2019s going to take a long time and that\u2019s how we are factored into. We are not factoring much of an economic impact in North America at all. What do you see, Bob? Robert Sharp : Yes. I mean, the U.S. outlook for us in the second half is dramatically more difficult than any other region. The general industrial, the construction environment, as I mentioned, the cold chain environment, frankly we can see all of that being challenged for a while. Again, until we have the comfort, until the job losses ebb and we get the comfort of people getting back to work which is going to take a little time probably. David Farr : Yes. I mean, you look at over 330 million unemployed people in the United States. Let alone the people and climate, and let alone people that are fairly hold up in their homes right now that done want to come out.  So, I think this is going to be quite dramatic. It\u2019s going to take some time. It\u2019s not going to be like the China. I think Europe and those guys will probably pull up sooner and it\u2019s going to be tough one. Rob, anything else you want to add? Robert Sharp : No. David Farr : Anything else Rob? Robert McCarthy : Yes, no, that\u2019s very sobering. I guess, on top of that, I think your President of Safety in attendance so that\u2019s right. David Farr : Yes. Robert McCarthy : And again, I don\u2019t want to get into too much policy discussion, but one thing that\u2019s been mettlesome for everyone, bureaucracy and policy aside has been some of the shortages around testing. I guess, the question I would have is you kind of flex across your facilities and you look at Mike\u2019s chart, have you instituted your own kind of captive testing program for Emerson?  Or what have you done to make sure that you can create the best information an environment for your workers to go back with confidence of safety? David Farr : The big issue, I mean, everything we can work around the right equipment, the right spacing, the right environment, the right cleanliness, having cleaning your hands you probably gotten the facility to be clean and everything else. Staggering the workforce, heat, temperature of this virus, a little bit different temperature.  You could have a virus for several days before your temperature starts moving. The big issue that we\u2019ve all talked to the President about and he knows this from a business standpoint is we are going to have to have, what I call quick testing at facilities. So we are going to go back assuming and I mean, I am hearing more and more work yesterday out of Washington. They are coming along with quick testing that will allow us to have a much faster impact. So if we have someone comes sick in the facility, we can test him or her, find out if they are really sick and if they are sick isolate them and quickly isolate people around them and then cleanse and then get back to work. So we are going to be in this game here I think for the rest of this year.  The vaccine thing \u2013 we can\u2019t wait for a vaccine. There won\u2019t be any business left to wait for a vaccine. We\u2019ve got to have the testing ability to find out who had it. Who has got it right now and I think that\u2019s the big push both at in Washington in the medical communities, because they know from business we need that.  We can do everything around that except that. And so the quicker that we get that and I know they know that, and that\u2019s why I heard yesterday they are ramping up the news upon millions of the testing that puts testing. And that\u2019s going obviously \u2013 we\u2019ll benefit from that, because that\u2019s going to come from pharmaceutical industry, the drug industry. But in the mean time Rob, we are going to do everything around that and that quick testing things got to come. It\u2019s got to come to give confidence to the workers. In the mean time, we are going to do everything we can to keep things safe and that\u2019s where we are right now. But, we as a company, I think the number is under 40 people globally have had tested.  Lal on this community that meets every morning. 40 people are tested. We've unfortunately had one individual part-time worker in England passed away, guy. It was a very unfortunate situation. Our isolations really dropped off right now. The new faces have really dropped off. But safety is a paramount to what we are doing and when we got top, top people on this thing and they are countering people like me who has, from my standpoint you charge forward.  You are out there. You are dealing with issues. I mean, I am the type of the guy that would lead in World War II, if you got that impression. So that's where we are. I am going to take one more question from the sell-side, one more sell-side analyst and then we are going to lock it down. Operator : Next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for fitting me in. David Farr : Hey, Joe. Joe Ritchie : So, Dave, just, I guess, my first question, when you think about that 14% number, the organic decline in the third quarter, can you just talk about April specifically? Is that been trending at that number already or below that number? I am just curious, like where you stand today, month-to-date or quarter-to-date on \u2013 versus that number? David Farr : Our order pattern right now is below negative 15. So we are tracking below that at this point in time on Bob\u2019s business. Lal\u2019s business is probably a little bit better than that. Lal has going to get some backlog.  So we will look at that 14, we go plus and minus one-and-a-half, most likely to be around 14%, 15%. The key thing that we will come out with \u2013 we will come out with the orders in April, May. We will get that out for everybody, Joe. But right now, the trend line dropping quite rapidly. But we are starting to see some stabilization in our international markets including Europe.  So the key is the big wildcard for us right now of substitute is the U.S. going back from my comments for Rob. This is still in a free fall and the question will be, how do we stabilize this from a business standpoint in the near-term. So I think that, I feel very comfortable even today as I talk to the audit committee yesterday morning, this 14%, 15% negative third quarter is well in tune. And I expect our orders when we come back and we\u2019ll see that our orders are probably around that 14%, 15% in the month of April. Joe Ritchie : Got it. Okay. And maybe just kind of following on there and like, I\u2019ll let go everybody else\u2019s comments. Really appreciate all the rigor and level of detail that you guys wanted to give us is much information as you did today. But just following on that last point, Dave, so, when you think about that in the U.S. as we progress through the year, I mean, it\u2019s really hard to know exactly how the shape of the recovery is going to be? So how much is China I guess influencing your thoughts around the U.S. and kind of that improvement in the growth pattern as we head into 4Q and into 2021? David Farr : I think that from my perspective, I said earlier Joe, that people like to make that earlier comparison \u2013 same comparison. It\u2019s not to happen the same way. China is a controlled society. They work extremely hard. They shut it down hard. It seems somehow this sickness was only in a couple of regions.  And they came in structurally. What we learned in China from our facilities, obviously, we are using from a safety standpoint in other facilities around the world. So I think the China structure is completely different. It will help us obviously. But we are looking at here and the U.S. is a completely different cycle and Europe a completely different cycle.  It\u2019s in a different world. So we are looking at U.S. is far more negative, far more muted and much more I would say a U shaped type of a structure it\u2019s what we are going to stay down longer and then gradually come back out of it in the second half of 2021. We do not see a quick snap back at this point in time in the U.S.  Now, if there somehow that everyone got back to work right away, we got the testing that we needed, maybe the fourth \u2013 the third calendar quarter, we could start seeing stuff. But I think that\u2019s going to be more in the fourth quarter of this year. So I am very negative on the U.S. sales model and I\u2019ll let Lal and Bob talk about this.  But that\u2019s how we see it right now. We are structuring a completely different cycle for each of the world areas based on historical norms and based on what we are seeing from our custom right now. So, Lal? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, absolutely agree. And so I went around the horn with my world area leaders yesterday, it was clearly a North America challenge significantly more so than anywhere else. David Farr : So, why don\u2019t give me couple colors? We got some colors in North America. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. I\u2019ll give you. David Farr : I\u2019ll never give this much information again. You have to rip my tongue out there if we give this much information. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, I\u2019ve already given you the color around what\u2019s happening with quotation rates. RFQ is down in that 25% rate in our \u2013 across our businesses. But just to give you perspective globally, globally, we were booking approximately $850 million a month. That was our runrate as we went through 2019 into the first quarter of 2020. In P7, we book somewhere around $680 million. But that\u2019s kind of drop off is very significant. That 15-ish plus percent\u2026 David Farr : P7 for him is April. Let\u2019s say work on period. Lal Karsanbhai : That\u2019s April. And the biggest hit in that is the U.S. and Canada. The other world areas, Europe, Asia and Middle East will exceed their plan. But the Americas particularly will be challenged therein. So, Asia will be very closely, honestly to a normal \u2013 we call, a normal month in booking. Surprisingly, as they return and Europe doesn\u2019t look as bad. But it\u2019s really not America impact. David Farr : And Europe is getting a lot of medical bookings because that's.. Lal Karsanbhai : I would call, lot of life science, David, and oil and gas honestly downstream we won a significant order with BP yesterday in Azerbaijan for our controls, a digital twin control system. David Farr : So, I think it\u2019s an international market and so that\u2019s what we see right now. I think the companies that are very international will have the benefits. Bob, you want to add anything. Anything, Bob you want to add? Robert Sharp : No. Again I think, we don\u2019t expect to see the U.S. go down as hard as China did, but we expect to see us stay down longer. So, that will take a little time. Again, it all depends. If people get back to work, if there is a vaccination all this kind of things, second half of next year could be a very exciting second half for us.  If that plays our longer, then that could change. But we will come out of these before. We\u2019ve had some pretty strong quarters and again hopefully that scenario will build up in this one as well. David Farr : We need the testing and the medical support to happen. And I think that\u2019s what business people tell you. But I want to thank everybody for the calls and I appreciate everyone calling and listening. And I know it\u2019s a lot of material. I apologize. But I thought it was important for everyone to have that input and look forward.  I know Pete will be very busy in the phone to talk about the follow-ups here for the day. But I appreciate everyone. And I hope \u2013 hopefully we\u2019ll be able to see everybody and unlike that the famous doctor that works for Donald Trump, I intend to shake hands and hug people at some point in time before I die. And so, I am a hand shaker and I don\u2019t believe this hand shake will disappear. I mean, if we are all going to be that word, you might as well jump the water right now. But I look forward to seeing everybody and I look forward to seeing what unfolds here in the coming months. But rest assured Emerson is at business.  Emerson is working and Emerson is working as extremely hard to make sure that we can take advantage and solve everything that needs to be solved here in the coming months. Thank you. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Pete Lilly, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Pete Lilly : Good afternoon. Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to Emerson's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.  Today, I am joined by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Lal Karsanbhai, Executive President of Emerson Automation Solutions; and Bob Sharp, Executive President of Emerson Commercial & Residential Solutions. As usual, I encourage you to follow along in the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Starting with the cover slide. In the era of COVID-19, safety and health have been rightfully brought to the forefront of the global conversation. At Emerson, safety is a core value. And in June, our employees celebrated Global Safety Day to reflect on the importance and personal responsibility of each individual to foster healthy and safe behavior. Additionally, Emerson has a passion for STEM education and innovative thinking as critical enablers for the needs of business and society both today and in the future. Emerson recently hosted a virtual STEM competition in cooperation with our Impact Partner here in North America, Spartan Controls. The winners designed wearable devices that gave alerts when within a 6-foot social distance barrier. Congrats to the winners, Kaiden and Caleb Manji. Please join me in turning to Slide 3. I'd like to briefly highlight the Emerson Corporate Social Responsibility Report, which is also available on our website. This document highlights in detail all of Emerson's aspirations and accomplishments within the environmental, social and governance realms. COVID-19 and the ongoing social discussions are catapulting many of these important ESG topics to the forefront. As problem solvers at our core, Emerson strives to advance the discussion, share our own progress and strategies and also to be a valued resource for our customers as they embark on their own ESG journeys. Emerson takes very seriously our role as a critical enabler and partner for digital monitoring, measurement, optimization and efficiency management across our broad customer base. Please turn with me to Slide 4. Despite the challenges presented by COVID-19 in the quarter, there were also many reasons for cautious optimism. I'd like to briefly share a few. First, Emerson remains steadfast in our commitment to health and safety for our employees, customers and communities. Business continuity, disciplined cost control and positioning to outperform as we emerge from COVID-19 remain our additional key thematic priorities. Our regionalized supply chain and operations remain resilient and stable in the current environment, and we continue to work hard to ensure we can serve our customers and their essential industries. In the quarter, the team was able to exceed adjusted EPS guidance by $0.20, with $0.16 being attributable to strong operational execution. A lower effective tax rate also contributed to the overall adjusted EPS beat. Cash flow was strong in the quarter, representing 181% conversion of net earnings. Additionally, the team was able to manage decremental margins to the mid-20s level at adjusted EBITDA. Despite the uncertainty and continuing challenged demand environment, sales and orders finished in line with guidance given in April. As expected, China is leading the emergence from the downturn with positive sales growth of 3%. Additionally, we are seeing trailing 3-month orders starting to stabilize, highlighted by Commercial & Residential Solutions' month of June year-over-year orders turning positive. Finally, based on current recovery trends, we expect sales to turn positive in either Q2 or Q3 of next year. Moving to Slide 6, which summarizes results of the quarter. Underlying sales growth was within guidance, down 15%. Trailing 3-month underlying orders were also within expectations, down 19%, reflective of the ongoing challenging demand environment. GAAP earnings per share were down 31% to $0.67, and adjusted earnings per share were down 18% to $0.80, which was $0.2 above guidance. Despite lower sales, both platforms executed well on profitability due to COVID-19-related cost control measures, in addition to the ongoing aggressive restructuring reset actions. Automation Solutions underlying sales were down 13%. However, China sales were up 9% as it emerged from lockdown. Trailing 3-month underlying orders were down 19%. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales and orders were both down 19%. However, as previously mentioned, June orders turned positive, which continued a positive trend in month-over-month orders. Cash flow performance was solid in the quarter with operating cash flow of $842 million and free cash flow of $738 million. Year-to-date operating cash flow and free cash flow of $1.85 billion and $1.53 billion were up 3% and 8% over prior year, respectively. Lastly, the company continued to build upon its aggressive cost reset plan, initiating a total of $94 million of restructuring actions in the quarter. Turning to Slide 7, we will bridge adjusted EPS. Beginning with third quarter of 2019 adjusted EPS of $0.97, you will see that nonoperational items of foreign exchange effects, stock price effects and pension detracted $0.09, which was offset by a more favorable tax rate than expected due to R&D credits and other items. The net effect was a $0.01 tailwind. Operations contained the deleverage to $0.20, and share repurchases added $0.02 for a net $0.18 headwind. Overall, we finished the quarter at $0.80, which was $0.20 above previous guidance. Additionally, total segment adjusted EBIT and EBITDA margins of 16.8% and 21.9% exceeded their respective guidance ranges of 15% to 15.5% and 20% to 20.5%. Slide 8 depicts the key elements and magnitude of operational performance on adjusted EPS. Starting with adjusted EPS guidance of $0.60, we saw both business platforms as well as corporate contribute to the SG&A containment. Automation Solutions contributed $0.10; Commercial & Residential Solutions, $0.02; and corporate, $0.04, for a total effect of $0.16. Additionally, the effective tax rate came in at 11% compared to the guided 18%, which provided a $0.05 tailwind. Subtracting $0.01 for other items, the adjusted EPS winded at $0.80. The leverage was contained to 26% at adjusted EBITDA. Moving to Slide 9, we will review the P&L. Starting with gross margin, we saw a reduction of 140 basis points to 41.3% as deleverage and unfavorable mix were partially offset by favorable price cost. Importantly, SG&A as a percent of sales declined by 20 basis points as aggressive cost control actions went into effect as volume declined. Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA margins, which exclude restructuring and related costs, decreased 240 basis points and 150 basis points, respectively. This outcome reflected deleverage from the decline in revenue being offset by restructuring savings and cost-containment actions. Lastly, our effective tax rate dropped from 20.3% to 11.2% driven by nonrecurring tax items, including R&D credits. Overall, the adjusted EPS decline of 18% from $0.97 to $0.80 was in line with the revenue decline. Turning to Slide 10. We will look at underlying sales by geography. The Americas showed the steepest declines, down 20%, with the United States down 20% driven by broad-based weakness in all industries, except medical and life sciences. Europe and Middle East, Africa & Asia were both down 9%. China, however, grew at 3% as the economy was the first to broadly reemerge from lockdown. Please turn now to Slide 11, and we will discuss total business segment performance. Total segment adjusted EBIT margin decreased 170 basis points to 16.8%, reflecting aggressive cost-control measures and strong operational execution as sales declined. And as previously mentioned, total segment adjusted EBITDA deleverage was 26%. Stock price-related costs increased $20 million as the stock price improved from lows at the end of the prior quarter. Adjusted corporate and other costs dropped by $14 million as aggressive cost controls, travel restrictions, salary reductions and other measures took effect. Adjusted pretax earnings dropped 270 basis points to 14.1%. However, 180 basis points of that movement can be explained by pension, stock price and foreign exchange losses. Q3 cash flow performance was solid given the challenging environment. Operating cash flow and free cash flow both decreased by 11% to $842 million and $738 million, respectively. Free cash flow represented 181% conversion of net earnings. Lastly, the drop in net sales resulted in an increase in ending inventory and lower payables. Turning to Slide 13, we will review the business platforms. Automation Solutions underlying sales finished down 13% for the quarter as broad-based declines in most end markets were only slightly offset by life sciences, medical and food and beverage. North America saw the steepest declines, down 20%. Meanwhile, China led the recovery, growing by 9%. The Final Control and Systems businesses were down high single digits and mid-single digits, respectively. Trailing 3-month underlying orders remained within expectations at down 19%, again reflecting broad-based demand challenges. Aggressive restructuring actions totaled $80 million across the platform, which brought the total to $192 million year-to-date. The platform delivered on profitability in a very challenging demand environment with adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA margins down 120 basis points and 30 basis points, respectively, reflecting the aggressive cost actions taking effect. Decremental margins were held to 22% at adjusted EBITDA. Of note, sequential backlog was unchanged at $5.1 billion. Turning to Slide 14. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales were down 19%, also reflective of the broadly weak demand environment due to COVID-19. North America led the declines, down over 20%, while Europe dropped 12% as momentum in the heat pump business was more than offset by declines in professional tools and cold chain. Asia, Middle East & Africa was down 18%, with China down 9%. Order rates varied dramatically during the quarter from down 35% in April year-over-year to positive 1% in June. Trailing 3-month underlying orders were down 19% driven by weakness across the distribution and OEM-based businesses. In contrast, businesses exposed to big-box retail and do-it-yourself markets fared better and were down mid-single digits. Asia orders dropped by 20%, while China was down 7%. For the quarter, restructuring actions totaled $12 million, which brought the total figure to $31 million year-to-date. Commercial & Residential Solutions also delivered solid profitability given the demand environment with adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA down 270 basis points and 160 basis points, respectively. Decremental margins at adjusted EBITDA were 32%. Turning to Slide 16, we will review the updated guidance. The impact of COVID-19 certainly continues to present a challenging demand environment. However, we are raising guidance due to early signs of stabilization and good momentum in cost-containment and restructuring actions. First, we assume demand will continue to stabilize and gradually improve. There are no major operational or supply chain disruptions, no changes in discrete tax items and oil prices remain in the $35 to $45 range. With those assumptions in mind, we now expect underlying sales to be down 9% to down 7.5% and net sales down 10% to down 9% for the year, only slight refinements from previous guidance. We are raising expected adjusted EPS to the range of $3.20 to $3.35, an increase of approximately 6% from the previous midpoint of $3.10 to the new midpoint of $3.27. Expected total restructuring spend has increased by approximately $20 million to $300 million, with approximately $235 million coming from Automation Solutions, $55 million coming from Commercial & Residential Solutions and the balance from corporate. Please note that we will review the updated restructuring reset spend and savings plan as well as the COVID-19-related cost savings in detail later during the presentation. We expect operating cash flow to come in at approximately $2.8 billion, and CapEx spending expectations remain $550 million, resulting in a free cash flow target of approximately $2.25 billion. Lastly, our share repurchase program remains complete for the fiscal year. And now please turn to Slide 18, and I will hand the call over to Mr. David Farr. David Farr : Thank you very much, Pete. Appreciate your inputs. Pete wants to be called Commander Pete, and he's got a new name, come with a military background. I didn't have to deal with this with Tim. But Pete, I do. By the way, I did see Tim today. We had a Board call, and Tim was in Germany with my German Director, and his family has arrived in Germany. He's the President of Professional Tools in Germany. He's doing well, and his family are now there. And his kids will be going to school live. And so it's good to see Tim. He seem to be pretty happy today. And I never had to call him Commander, but again, he couldn't kill me with 2 fingers like you. With that, I want -- on the order trend chart, as I would say, the trends for orders were pretty much in line to what we thought would happen in the quarter from a month-by-month basis. Clearly, you can see Commercial & Residential has seen -- found the bottom in the month of June. I think you'll see that, that has improved again in the month of July. I'll let Bob talk about that. Lal continues to -- seem to be stabilizing around this bottom. And I'll let him talk a little bit about his businesses. But overall, month by month, we saw the quarter unfold exactly like we thought it was going to unfold relative to orders, relative to sales. Margins came in much better as you've seen from the cost reset actions and to what we call the COVID-related savings. Therefore, cash flow came in better, too. Overall, execution was extremely good. And I really want to thank the global leaders relative to their strength of operations throughout the quarter. I want to thank the whole team around the world. As you know, the OCE and top 10 or 15 people in this building, at the corporate headquarter, never left the building. We now have the whole building back. We have our campus back. Obviously, from time to time, we might lose somebody, but we're all here. Operations are working around the world. We have not had really many hiccups. We've lost a couple of days here and there in Bob's case and in Lal's case. But overall, great execution by the team around the world as I share that with the Board, and we are acting and running this company live, in person, in our offices as best that we can, not everywhere but as much as we can. And I really thank them for what they have done because it's been a very challenging quarter. As you know, we laid out our forecast in mid-April. We went out early. We executed around the plans from an order standpoint, sales, manufacturing. And we really, really did a great job around the cost reductions both from the reset actions, which we started last June, which we have accelerated, and we'll talk a little bit more about those; two, the COVID-related adjusted savings from the onetime cuts, the furloughs, delays in salaries, obviously, no travel, entertainment, all those things, and we'll talk more about those. All those came in very well and helped us from a profitability standpoint. But in particular, what I was extremely pleased to see is, as we laid out that detailed major cost-reduction reset program back in February to the shareholders but to the Board last year in August time period, they really have stayed ahead of it, and they've actually increased the numbers. You'll see that in the charts coming up. And that's not easy to do in an environment where you're not able to travel. You have hard times having meetings, but these guys have done a phenomenal job relative to really driving those programs forward. We're in a different phase right now. We're in the phase of actual consolidation of facilities, shutdown facilities, new facilities, we're moving stuff at this point in time versus the initial phase, a lot tougher phase. And both of the businesses are on track and I think are doing extremely well, and I'm very pleased with that. With the effort in the quarter, which was better than I thought from the earnings, better than I thought from a cash flow, we have raised the year. We have confidence in the year. And I'll let Bob and Lal talk a little bit about that. But really, from the execution on operations, we really did a great job. And from that perspective -- but I just was pleased to see from the standpoint of that execution and what we saw, and we'll see as we go into the quarter. I think from my standpoint, our -- I think that we will see some strength emerge from the businesses. I think the profitability will continue to do well. And I think that, look, we're going to have a very good order from that standpoint. And what I'd like Bob and Lal to talk about briefly here first, about the orders first, and then we're going to go in to talk a little bit about the quarters. But Bob, why don't you give them a little color what you're seeing right now in orders, and Lal, you do the same thing? And then we'll go into a couple of other charts here. Robert Sharp : Okay. Thanks, Dave. As Pete mentioned earlier, the front end of the quarter was very much unlike the back end of the quarter. April really dropped severely really everywhere, North America A/C, in particular, with a lot of plant spend down, including customer facilities and professional tools, a lot of the channel basically just shutting down and offices being closed. And then, of course, we ended with June swinging up positive. So quite a dramatic change. And the numbers we have for July right now is right around flat. So we're holding pretty solid again. The 3 months through June was down 19, and that will bring the July 3 months into the 5 to 10 range. So definitely going in the right direction. Coming out of it -- as going in was broad, coming out of it is really quite broad, too. But again, North America A/C, you all follow a lot of the HVAC producers in North America, clearly, when the heat hit in late June, that made a dramatic difference, and we felt it very quickly. The DIY space continues to be very strong. So the VAC business and InSinkErator in particular, quite good. Pro Tools was very strong. Part of that, I think, is basically branches reopening, and it's kind of a little bit of a channel ballup, I would say, more than the market itself, but June was certainly quite different. And Europe in July was quite strong as well. The European heat pump business is very dynamic right now in total, and we've got some very good relationships with some OEMs and are enjoying some very strong growth right now. David Farr : Yes. I think, Bob, one of the key issues we talked about on the lines -- I've had a lot of investors on the line over the last 2 or 3 months is we knew the bounce would happen. The question -- the key issue for us is to keep these factories going. And that's what Bob's right now is very focused because, on a global basis, this demand is coming back, and what we want to make sure is we deliver on that demand and not miss this bounce. And we've gone through these before. And I think that right now, his teams are very much focused on that. I've been to a couple of the sites, and they're all getting ready for a sequential bounce this quarter, and that's going to be a key milestone for us from that perspective. Robert Sharp : Yes, factory is very much in focus right now, being able to deliver against these numbers. David Farr : Yes. Lal, do you want to give -- obviously a different part of the cycle and -- from that perspective, but you are, I would say, forming the bottom at this point in time, and you clearly have the same issues, relative mix, but you have broad industry capability. So why don't you give them a flavor of what you see relative to your orders right now before we can get into sales of the global businesses. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, David. Good afternoon, everyone. Yes, clearly, operating around the bottom of this order cycle as we feel it through June. And actually, July came in, on a daily basis, about 4% above the month of June as we saw broad stabilization particularly in Europe and driven by some growth in China and stabilization in North America. So really, there's 3 phenomena, David, as we think about the order rates. Obviously, oil and gas upstream is one. That predominantly impacts our strong upstream markets, North America and Europe to some extent, and has had an impact particularly on the short-cycle businesses to begin with and now extending into some of the longer-cycle businesses. We've seen reduced OpEx, and we've seen deferred CapEx as a result. Secondly, people are not right back in the plants yet. That's had a detrimental impact in day-to-day KOB 3 orders as plants have been kept open and safe but with less folks in them. And consequently, projects aren't being executed, modernizations aren't happening. And some of that will come back as people return to work, but that's had an impact through the quarter and where we sit today. And then lastly, I'll highlight that China has recovered. And we had a good quarter in China, positive orders and sales, and we're seeing that broader stabilization across Europe and, hopefully, North America here as we go through July as well. David Farr : Thanks. As we expected, we would expect Lal to lag in the cycle. He went down slower. He did not have a minus 20% in the early stages. He could easily have that in a quarter and a month here. But he's in a different cycle right now, but I feel very good about where they sit. And we're starting to see pretty good insights around that. We go on the next chart, Chart 19. If you look at the underlying sales, from our perspective, we were dead-on from the underlying number that we talked about for the quarter, maybe slightly better than we thought originally. You can see that what we're going into now in the fourth quarter, very similar to what we had before but I would say just slightly better. I think Bob's business, he'll talk a little bit about it here in the next chart or 2, was slightly better. I think Lal's business is going to be -- the key issue for him is going to be backlog reduction. But as we move in this trend line and, directionally, right now, what we're seeing based on the customer input, based on economic trend lines, based on the opening of the world is that we have a chance to go positive in the second quarter in sales, slightly positive. It will be -- everything has to move right. But last quarter, I wouldn't have been able to say that to you. Right now, it looks like that's the case, and things have to go the right way. But overall, the direction and the trend lines of this cycle feel pretty well understood at this point in time, and we're managing around that. And we're having to really allocate a lot of resources because we have businesses -- within Lal's business, were up 20%, like, in life sciences or in power, he's very strong. And Bob's got businesses, too, that are growing right now. So we're having to move resources around, and we're having to be very careful relative to our plant restructuring and modernization as we see this trend line change. And it's very interesting. I've been around a long time, as you all know, as CEO and at Emerson. I've never seen a cycle quite like this where we've had sudden surges in certain pieces and other pieces drop off. So it's really -- by being together as a management team day to day and looking at each other eyeball to eyeball, no spitting but just eyeball to eyeball, we are -- we have a chance to actually manage this very well. And I feel good about it. So what I'd like to do is turn to Lal first and give a little bit of update on your chart relative to what you see as underlying growth in China and what you see as your point of inflection right now, but I think he feels very good about what's happening. Lal Karsanbhai : I do. I do, David. I think you said it correctly. I mean I think what you said generally applies to automation, to the automation market and our sales performance over the next 6 quarters. But essentially, the story for us in Q4 is going to be stabilization of the book-to-ship order environment in North America and backlog execution. Consistent with the plan that we shared with you last quarter, we have to execute about $300 million of backlog in the quarter. The good news there is that in the month of July, we took $96 million of backlog value. So we're well on that path but works to do in August and September. That will land at somewhere in the 10% to 12% down range. The offsetting there is the book-to-ship. And then we see an additional 2 challenging quarters. We have a shot to get flat in Q2 depending, as David described, how things swing on the order environment. But clearly, we see a positivity in the second half of the year on a global basis on orders and sales, David. David Farr : One of the interesting things Lal showed today to the Board, just to give you an information, you had 5 customers, you did a lot of workaround looking at the trend lines of cars, where you can pick up trend line of cars, how many people on the factory. Factories are operating at 30%, 40% levels. And you can directly correlate that to our sales of those individual factories, which was pretty interesting insights that you shared with the Board today. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, sir. We used the Google mobility data and plotted it against our daily order run rates in North America, and there clearly is a linear relationship there, particularly as people are just not been -- they've been working from home, and folks aren't in the plants to place POs and that kind of stuff. So we need those folks to get back in the plants clearly, particularly here in North America. On the bottom of the chart, we've got China, which was a tough story, down 21% in the second quarter but came back very strongly for us in Q3. We see good activity broadly in China. Orders, on a destination basis, were also positive in the quarter in China. So we see some good momentum there on the order rates. The sales comparisons get very, very challenging in Q4, which is why you see that 2 to 5 down range for us into Q4. It's nothing more than just an incredibly tough comparison to Q4 last year, which was a record on just about every measure for us in China. It will still be a very strong number to execute within that range. And China sales year-to-date are positive, which is helping us. And then we see an environment that's positive as we go through fiscal '21. David Farr : Okay. Lal Karsanbhai : I'll turn it to Bob. David Farr : Bob, why don't you give an update on what you see unfolding in the quarterly sales at this point in time? Robert Sharp : Okay. So again, you can see that Q3, we ended up coming in at down 19. Right now, the fiscal year guidance has been updated to 8 to 10. So if you do that math, it puts us in probably in the 5 to 11 range for Q4. So if things keep going the way they're going, we do feel like there's potential upside. Again, June and July single-month orders were a bit stronger. Part of that, again, I think is catch-up on April and May. We're much lower than 19 down. And then -- and they're actually -- we have a small amount of long-cycle business. We do gas compression for recovery, like landfills and digesters and farms and such, for green activity. And that looks actually pretty strong right now. So that'll give us some projects for '21 as well. So you can see right now, Q1 down, Q2 right now was a bit hard to tell. We expect Asia and do it -- DIY kind of strengths to be kind of leading us out, if you will, and then the other stuff should come in broadly, certainly in Q3, especially with the comp we'll have against this year. So again, feeling -- overall, feeling good about a strong recovery. We've seen that before, like in the financial crisis. And of course, there's still a lot of unknowns what's going to happen in the next 12 months. Yes. China, as mentioned, that's been a roller coaster for us. We were down heavily in early '19. It was moving up. We had talked about potentially being up in Q4 of last year, and then it kind of stumbled a bit. We did get positive in Q1. And then when COVID hit in Q2, it was very dramatic in terms of the hit. Q3 came in down 9. It's mixed basically is kind of the best description. It's not a broad strength right now for our areas with some of the stuff that's happening, and we look for that to keep going up. Again, it will probably go sideways a little bit for a while here. And then certainly, again, as we get into Q2, with the comparisons, it should be good. And then outside of China, the rest of Asia is a bit of a factor, too, in terms of the total numbers. And hopefully, if we get the U.S. strength that we're looking at in China, it should follow in line with those. David Farr : Yes. Thank you. Appreciate that. If you go to the next chart, one of the things we wanted to do is lay out and give you the detail by the first half, second half what we call the reset restructuring. I want to make sure the whole total program is well understood, both what's in it, what's going to be moved around both this year and next year. Also, we want to give you insights relative to what we call the COVID-related savings, which are from actions we took from furloughs, to pay cuts, to bonus cuts, to also no traveling and all the different things that unfolded in the COVID number, which, for this year, it's worth about $150 million to us. But if you look at the total program that we've laid out over the last -- since February to the outside world, you can see in '19 -- 2019, we spent $95 million. This year, we're spending around $300 million. I believe that's up a tad during the last time we talked, and we're looking at $125 million, which is again up a little bit from what we talked about as we continue to really focus on the programs and the reset programs, which are permanent program actions, which we've got benefit already. We're already feeling it. As you can see, the savings and the reset program in the first half was $75 million. In the second half, it's going to be $145 million. And if you go into next year, it's going to be $210 million in total. So it's a very important program, and it's actually working. And then we're going to have benefits in '22 and '23 from the initial -- of the actions that are going on right now at the facility levels around the world, which take longer to get done. But overall, our payback, our cost -- total program's going to be around $500-plus million of restructuring. And we'll have over $500 million of savings from the reset program, ignoring the COVID-related areas. On the chart, you can see what we talk about, as we look at -- we want to give you an estimate. We see, as business does come back, it's a function of how fast business comes back, how fast we can travel again and what we can do. But right now, our best estimate is we have $150 million savings this year from COVID-related, $70 million of that will start flowing back. We're -- the pay cuts we took in place, the furloughs, all those things will start reversing here. And they will start flowing back into the P&L. It will be a headwind for us. But right now, our best guess at this point in time is $70 million to $150 million will flow back in over time in 2021. If growth takes off faster and we're able to travel, clearly, those numbers will shrink, and we'll have more cost coming back into the P&L next year. But it's our best guess at this point in time as we look at it. But I wanted to make sure you had a distinction between the reset cost-reduction programs, which are really well done by the global organizations, both in Lal's side and Bob's side and also corporate, and then also what we see going on the COVID-related. So you've got a lot of detail there, and you can track everything that's going on at this point in time. But I think it's necessary for you to understand what's going on. And a lot of hard work, when I look at what the organization got done from a profitability standpoint this quarter, it really paid off all the work we did last year as we started. As we continue to go forward, our margins, our cash flow is better. It's allowing us to stay on track relative to the savings despite sales being down as hard as they are at this point in time. So I feel as we look at the next couple of months, the next, let's say, next 3, 4, 5, 6 months, I think we have a pretty good vision of what's going to unfold here. I see the savings flowing through. We are obviously going to be very cautious in how we put money back into it as we start seeing that growth happen. But we want to make sure that we are serving our customers, and we're making sure we support our customers around the world as we go forward. But the organization on a global basis has had to do a lot of things without a day-to-day contact with leaders. I guarantee none of the leaders at the OC level have been able to travel into Europe. We've not been into Asia. We've not been in Latin America. I am starting -- I am traveling. Sorry, I am traveling in North America, as is Lal and Bob, and we're doing site reviews. We're getting out. We're actually -- the first time I got to walk a factory -- the first time I really felt safe walking our factory, one, I didn't want to contaminate people in the factory or them contaminate me, but we walked into a couple of factories here recently. This is important. Our people want to see -- in fact, I've been in 3 factories now in the last couple of weeks. People want to see us. And we're out -- it's important to go out for what they're doing in the factories today is not easy. And I really want to make sure they understand how much we appreciate that, what they're doing. But that's where we sit. We feel good about it. It was a great quarter execution. I want to thank the team. They did a phenomenal job. I want to thank the OCE for standing by me, coming in the office every day, even though they may not want to go in the office every day, but we were here. And it's important for the people around the world that are in the office working very hard at this point in time. Factories are working well. And now we see the trend lines coming our way in Bob's business first and Lal will follow second. And I feel good about where we sit right now overall. And let's turn the -- open the floor for Q&A, and let's go from there. Thank you very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Can you hear me, David? David Farr : Good to hear from you. Scott Davis : I just bought one of your InSinkErators. There's a shortage of those things out there, by the way. I'm sure you know that. David Farr : Yes, we do know that. Thank you very much, Scott, nice comment there. We're working on that issue. Scott Davis : Hot topic. Dave, just to think about your own business, the guidance on the restructuring is great. But what else changes as you think about when you get into 2021? I mean your own capital spending, cash flow probably isn't quite as easy. I mean how do you think about ramping up your own spend? David Farr : I think that as we look at it right now, to be honest, I think we'll probably spend a little less this year, Scott. So I think we're forecasting around $550 million. I think it will probably be a little lower. The reason for that is the inability to travel and get to the projects and get them organized. And that -- those are very important projects. There's a lot of automation work going on right now. We have the plant repositioning. But what we want to do is use automation now. Because of the whole COVID situation and distancing and trying to get the production out of the facilities, we're going to be putting a lot more automation into these facilities as we relay them out. So I would say our capital spending will be a little bit higher next year. But we're not going crazy on this because our volumes are still going to be, on average, down in total probably for the next year. And I think that -- but I would expect capital to be coming up as we go in to automate the facilities, as we have several new facilities underway. So I would say overall, betting man right now, slightly less than $550 million capital this year. Next year number, we'll be having a 6 in front of it, in my opinion. And it could be $600 million or $601 million, but I think that's where we are right now. Our cash flow overall, you're exactly right. I think we'll be up a little bit. The fight -- issue next year is going to be the following. We are -- clearly, right now, receivables are going to start building because, sequentially, we're going to have a very strong fourth quarter. Sequentially, we're going to have a stronger fourth to first quarter because of what's going on here right now is what we feel. That's going to increase our receivables in the first half of the year, which is, from that standpoint, we'll make more earnings, we're going to have more receivables. So our balance sheet, which we've been liquidating a little bit this year, will be a headwind for us next year. And those things we know, and we're obviously working on that right now. But I would say that we'll generate the cash. We'll be more than 100% free cash flow to earnings, but it will be a little bit tougher next year because of the growth, which is a good thing to have, growth in the balance sheet. So that's how I see it right now, Scott. Scott Davis : Okay. Helpful. And then, Dave, I think I know the answer to this, but I want to hear your view. I mean what is your lowest visibility end market? Is it still oil and gas? Is it -- is there any hope at all in finding a bottom there? David Farr : Yes. I think I'll let -- I'm going to answer first, and I'll let Lal answer. First, I would say the toughest visible market is North America oil and gas. And I think we're starting to see some of the formation of the bottom here a little bit. I think you see automation come in. The key issue for us right now is when will they start doing some work around the fields, around the facilities. And that will be the tough decision. We're not seeing it yet. And we've tracked this up day to day to day because this market has not turned up in the month of July, like the rest of the market that Lal saw. So I think that's what we see. I think that will be well into '21. But I wouldn't be surprised if MRO or our KOB 3 business doesn't pop at some point in time, it's so low at this point. But Lal, what's you're feeling on that? Lal Karsanbhai : No, I couldn't agree more, David. I think you've said it. We're going to be through '21. But clearly, there are traditional roles in the oil and gas market that are being impacted and some are disappearing as a result of it. And interestingly enough, and you touched on it, David, Scott, this virus has been a catalyst for adoption of automation in the oil and gas industry. And we're seeing operations becoming -- automation and remote operations becoming more prevalent across the board, which poses an opportunity for us as people come back and as decisions on spending occurs. David Farr : Yes. So we have a lot of remote automation software equipment, and we see that being a great demand as they automate there. So there's an upside to this. We just got to get through it. And I feel good about where we are right now. I mean Lal's business is going through this trend. He's restructuring the heck out of things. Bob will come through this faster. He will spike faster. But I feel very good about where we are, and I feel extremely good and proud about the organization and having to deal with what's going on with them and not only worry about their families but worrying about being sick and worrying about the customer. And the big decision right now for North America, Scott, to be very honest with you -- the OCE -- because the OCE gets together several times a week now -- is this whole school thing. We've got a situation where we have a lot of young parents, single parents, 2 parents, 2 parents working, single home parents with kids, and what do we -- how are we going to help them get through the school thing. Our schools -- our government tax dollars are not helping us here. And so business has to pick this up, and that's an important decision because we're not going to leave -- let our kids get hurt again in this environment. And that's a tough call that we're all making right now, one-on-one, looking at each in the mirror, to be honest. So with that, Scott, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Dave, first question for you. Just thinking about your guidance for the fourth quarter, specifically as it relates to Commercial & Residential Solutions. It seems like you guys are implying like a mid-single-digit down quarter. Yet the trends seem pretty good, right, like towards the end of June and early July. So maybe talk a little bit about what's kind of dragging the growth there? And if you could specifically touch on resi HVAC in North America, I'd be curious to see what you guys are seeing there specifically. David Farr : Good, certainly. I'll comment first, and I'll let Bob comment. I think the key issue for us -- I think you're right, the order pattern is returning. Bob saw in mid-June. We saw it through July. I think it's across all of your business units had a pretty good July in orders. The big issue for us, Joe, is manufacturing output. You're taking the facility that historically would not be doing this much sequentially from quarter-to-quarter. We -- you obviously have attendance issues. You have issues relative to if you have a positive COVID in your plant. All these different things are working through us right now, and Bob and his team had the challenge of actually trying to improve output in an environment that -- where workers can be troublesome for us at this point in time. That's one of the biggest issues he has. I think from the standpoint of -- we're being cautious relative to the recovery. Things have hit pretty well, the heat wave. So residential HVAC has taken off, and Bob can talk further about that. That's not unexpected when you get this type of heat, which we had the last couple of weeks. But at the same time, we've got to keep the plants up and running, and we've got to be able to serve. And that's the biggest issue we face at this point in time. Keep in mind, sequentially, I think we typically do, Frank, around 250, 300 from third to fourth quarter. This year, we're going to do 500. We're going to do 500. So we could be doubling or sequential growth rate from quarter-to-quarter, which is something that with the plants just getting ramped down, ramp back up is the challenge. But I think I feel optimistic about that. I think Lal will have the plant -- the question is can he get the book-to-ship and can he get the backlog out which, so far, he's done reasonably well in July. Bob, any comment you want to add, any color on that from that standpoint? Robert Sharp : I'll just say right now, there's a lot of bullwhipping or whipsawing kind of stuff going on right now. There's the sell-through. Distribution has been in very different state. E-commerce is going gangbusters. The big box are doing very well. You've got a lot of professional distribution that has had branches closed for an extended period of time. OEMs, just like us, have got challenges at times with plants and absenteeism and other issues. So it's just -- there's a lot of noise in the system right now. Certainly, the June and July orders are very encouraging. We're working our S&OP, our operating plans, to be able to work that. As you mentioned, there can be challenges in some areas like dispose our inventory and including the distribution linkages of our customers. So again, June and July orders, no question, very encouraging. Pretty broad reporting, I think, in the HVAC, residential being very strong, commercial is still being difficult, refrigeration is still being quite difficult. With foodservice, in particular, we're seeing the same kind of thing. So I think we're -- given -- again, it's a bit of a range for a quarter, I suppose, for us to be talking about anywhere from 5 to 11 or so. We're already in the quarter, but it's just emblematic of what's going on right now. David Farr : Yes. Great. Joe, anything else you want to ask? Joseph Ritchie : Yes. No, those are -- that was great color. I guess just my one follow-up. I know last quarter you guys talked a little bit about getting the decremental margins back into the 20s by the fourth quarter. So expecting a little bit better growth out of Bob's business, but a little worse growth out of Lal's business. So I'd be curious to hear from both of them on your ability to get there in 4Q. David Farr : I think we did it in the third quarter. I feel very good that we'll do it again in the fourth quarter. The only thing that would be a problem would be a supply chain shock, which is, with Bob ramping up, he could have a supply chain shock. But I think right now, our cost controls, our reset programs, we've got great restructuring done in the third quarter. Obviously, the COVID -- I mean I feel very good that we'll be in the 20s again in the fourth quarter, I think, in the... Robert Sharp : Yes. I mean we had several down plant days in April and May either caused by us or caused by perhaps customers not being able to take anything. There's a lot of disruption in Q3 and a good amount of that clearing up. David Farr : And you had -- both had plants in Mexico that we're paying people to stay home because the government asks us to make these people stay at home because they potentially could -- a risk. So we're paying people to stay at home. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. And clearly, we've had the impact of the hard restructuring that we went after very hard now a year into the program, as you highlighted, David. We do have a step-up in volume sequentially, Q3 to Q4, which will also help. But we did hit those low 20 decrementals in Q3 already. So we're there, and I think we've got no reason to believe that won't hold us into Q4. David Farr : So I think the one thing I'd be worried about out of all the stuff, to be honest, Joe, it's the supply chain. We -- as we start now ramping up here in the fourth quarter, can our supply chain keep up with our goals basically. And there's a lot of work going on that. And we've been working on it now for two months because we knew this was coming at us, and so we've been getting ready for it for two months. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Walsh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Walsh : I also am in the same storm as Scott, so hopefully, I don't cut out. So thanks for all the color on Slide 22. Just thinking about that $140 million net, as you see it today, is there anything related to price cost or productivity net of inflation that you see as a detractor to that number? David Farr : Not right now, John. I think that the big issue for us right now will be the balance of -- the net material inflation relative to price. Fundamentally, we see that we're going to have a little bit different environment next year. I think pricing will be tougher. And therefore, the net material inflation is going to be the key issue for us. So pricing will be tougher. That will be in the red. And then, therefore, we need to have positive net material inflation. This is not something that we didn't expect. We expected this to happen. I know both Bob's business, the corporate organization and Lal's business have been focusing on this. It's going to be a very important issue relative to next year because we're trying to get through the year, as we say, neutral, not have a slightly green or slightly positive or red number here. So right now, I think we're in pretty good shape. I feel good about the balance. I feel good about that $140 million number that we talked about there, so nothing really causing a big issue for us at this point in time. So -- but the plan right now, I'd say, is a little bit red built into the plan. And I think that we're really working hard at the net material inflation at this point in time without stressing our supply chain too much because of what we got to expect in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter. One of the things you're going to see this year, which is a little bit different -- 2 things in the -- from the fourth to first, John, for companies thinking about this. So the year has been tough for companies, for companies like us. If there are programs out there that you get x dollars, you get rebates and stuff like that, no one is going to be earning rebates this year. So our customers are not going to be going and saying, \"Let's pull into the quarter.\" They're going to be pushing. So we're going to -- that's one thing you're going to see. Secondly, sequentially from fourth to first, I think you're going to see consistent demand improvement in Bob's business. And so inventory will continue to be flowing into the channel, which normally we would not be seeing. So those two things would say that we'd have a better first fiscal quarter or fourth calendar quarter because the trend line is what happened to us and the shock in the middle of the year. So there's a lot of things that we're putting on the table right now relative to our own planning, both in sales and also the S&OP, the manufacturing, because we know there's some moving parts relative to the way our customers are going to deal with this. And -- but right now, I feel good about the price cost, I feel good about our savings and just got to keep managing the day-to-day. John Walsh : Great. And then as a follow-up, maybe digging a little bit more into the margin performance at Automation. You talked about some challenges in the KOB 3 order rate, but can you actually talk a little bit about the mix of KOB 3 year-on-year if that was a good guy? Or -- I'm just trying to understand a little bit behind that margin performance. David Farr : I'll let Lal answer that question because Lal's got the facts, I'd be making it up. And you know me, John, I don't want to make it up for you because you'll call me on the math on this one. So Lal, why don't you tell him how year-to-date KOB 3 looks versus KOB 2 and KOB 1? I think it's the kind of business that people don't know. Lal Karsanbhai : That kind of business. 3, which is KOB 3 being the MRO, the small order size, it is typically what you see in day-to-day business, so a short-cycle business. That's continued to increase relative to where we finished the last fiscal year as we've navigated through this year. Part of that is a reflection of the size of POs are being issued. Part of it is a reflection of deferments in the larger capital modernization projects. So we're sitting north of 60% as we close the quarter. We don't have the exact numbers yet. There's a little bit of systems work that needs to be done for us to have the final number, but we'll be north of 60%, KOB 3, which is an over 5-point improvement what we finished last year. So it's definitely moved that way, John. But the fact of the matter is there's less of it. But the pie, the percentage has increased. David Farr : So one of the key issues here that we are tracking and is very tight on, in particular, going back to, I think Joe's question on the North America oil and gas, what we're watching very carefully is the order intake on a daily basis. This is important to us, in particular, in North America because that's where we're going to see the KOB 3 pop back up first. And when you're running a factory at 30%, 40%, with people in it, you're not doing much. But that's what we're watching because when that rate comes up, I mean it makes -- that tells us that the short-term stuff started kicking in, and our KOB 3 would be very good, and it helps our profitability. And we'd like to see some of that in the fourth quarter. We're not banking a lot in the fourth. We see it more in the first. But this sure would be a nice thing to have for us in the fourth because that would give us better leverage and better margins and better cash. Lal Karsanbhai : And maybe just a little color on that, David, in terms of North America specifically, through May and June, across our short-cycle businesses, the number of physical POs that we received was actually equal to last year's. David Farr : That's a good sign. Lal Karsanbhai : It's a good sign. However, the quantity of units within each PO dropped. And that's reflected in that sequential -- or daily order drop of the 20 million a day to the 15 million a day. We're continuing to drive the POS, but there's just less units in it. David Farr : So that's what we're watching, John. And we have that in detail because we can tell you very quickly when these things are going to turn. I mean you could smell Bob's business. Like, we are out talking to his guys, they could smell it. Lal's business, we know it's being brewed right now. So it's coming. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. And then just on the other end, we have not seen any decremental pricing on KOB 3 through this. The price has held, and it continues to be very strong. David Farr : Yes. And project-wise, since we're talking about KOB here, KOB 1, you've seen some pushouts, some cancellations, a lot of that new stuff. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, David. Honestly, we've had some wins. We booked a significant amount as we went through the quarter. We've also seen some deferments on KOB 1. David Farr : So there's not been a lot of movement in the bubbles or the pipeline. But we do know that what we're going to be living off is KOB 3 and KOB 2 here for the next, I would say, 18 months because the projects are going to be smaller. And we're doing a lot of refresh right now with a lot of inputs. And I think we'll give you more input as to next quarter because there's not enough movement right now even to say it's changed that much. But it's clearly -- there's influx right now, but we don't -- we feel pretty good about where we sit at this point in time because there are new projects and installed projects. Overall, we're holding pat. Our backlog right now is still holding right in there, which is pretty good. It's not being canceled. It's holding right in. Next question. John, do you have another question? John Walsh : No, I'll pass the baton. David Farr : Thank you very much, John. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : So look, you guys seem relatively confident about an at least modest recovery in FY '21. And I know a lot of that is based on your orders turning here. But you also talked, Dave, to a lot of customers. And what we hear from other CEOs is that confidence is pretty mediocre out there. So maybe you could tell us sort of the conversations you're having. And are you hearing more confidence out of the customers you're talking to despite the concerns around the infection resurgence that we've seen? David Farr : The answer's yes. First of all, we did put a forecast out there, Andy, and we did hit our forecast from April 24. And so I had enough confidence to put our neck out there in the line, and we hit it, and we actually did a little bit better. Yes, we've had conversations. We are seeing the markets around the world. I would say the more cautious market on the industrial side is the U.S. But as you look into Europe, as you look into Middle East, as you look into Asia, China, we are seeing those markets, there's a lot more confidence of the incremental spending. And we're seeing that business get a little better. And so that's why we feel reasonably confident. Now we're not changing much of our forecast from what we laid out in April relative to the fourth quarter. It's very similar. I think the key issue will be as Bob -- going back to a couple of questions earlier, if Bob's business orders continue to hold, he's able to produce it, then I would say Bob's going to have a stronger quarter, and that bounce is coming back after it's down 20%, 30%, 40% in those -- some of those months. So Andy, that's why we feel confident about it. We've been here and done this before. This turn is very similar to Bob's financial crisis turn. And Lal's business, a little bit different based on North America oil and gas. But I think we have enough confidence and enough, I would say, conservatism in the underlying sales forecast right now based on what we're hearing from our customers that we can say that. And that's how -- and we're very in tune to our customers right now. We're out talking to them. We're out visiting them. And so Lal, anything you want to add there? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. Thanks, David. We, myself and the leadership team, has been engaged in this. We've zoomed our way into many customer rooms and participated in many meetings, starting really in the mid-May to early June time frame. We -- our salespeople started to get out and see customers again. Obviously, our service people have been engaged throughout the crisis, engaged in plants. And so the projection really hasn't changed, and the sentiment from the customer base hasn't changed a whole lot, Andy. There's conservatism and concern in oil and gas, as David described. But there's optimism in medical, in life sciences, in food and beverage and in power. Look, we're having a record year in North America power. So it's a bit of a mixed bag there. But oil and gas really is where we're concerned, but that's no different than what we spoke about on April 24. David Farr : Yes. Being so broad an industry, we have a lot of industries doing better than other industries and -- so from that standpoint. And Bob said it right, I mean, they cut back so rapidly in Bob's business between inventory and shutdown, couldn't mix stuff, that we knew there was going to be a sharp bounce at some point in time, and that's what we're seeing right now. The question is, is it sustainable? And can we produce? And so that's what we see right now. Andrew Kaplowitz : Very helpful, guys. Yes, that's helpful, Dave. And let me just ask you specifically then about China because you know that region very well as well. There always seems to be some stimulus tailwinds. You do have some geopolitical issues to deal with, and some people think improvement in production is ahead of demand, but it seems like it's picked up for you guys. So what's the outlook for you initially as we go into '21 in China? David Farr : I think the -- what we're seeing right now is Lal's business, on a broad basis, is pretty good. And so I think he's going to see a pretty strong high single-digit growth as we go into 2021. The wildcard for us is Bob's business because the consumer in China has really pulled back in some of the programs. And the question will be when do they start spending money again, feeling confident of spending money. If you look at the air travel inside China, it's back pretty close to where it was before the COVID situation. Now international, no. But so the movement is starting to happen, and that will be a big impact for Bob as that starts happening. So we're waiting for a consistent improvement. I don't know what you saw in June and July, Bob, out of China. But he's being cautious at first. He does know he'll start getting easy comparisons. But what I'm trying to see is the underlying demand. So are you seeing any sense of improvement, from your standpoint, in China? Robert Sharp : It's kind of going -- it's in the high single-digit decline right now, 5 to 10 down. Again, the orders have been bouncy. We've gotten some bright spots at times, and then it flips. Like you said, I think the -- on the commercial side, there's a lot of stimulus programs that are being worked. But then on the consumer side, including housing, purchasing and everything, people are being very cautious just like U.S. with savings rate and everything. David Farr : Yes. So I think what we're going to see, Andy, is Lal will have a very solid year next year as they continue to make investments both in the life science area, the power area, the energy area, some chemical area. I think Bob will be the wildcard. I mean will he be a 0? Or will he be a 10-plus? And so that will be the wildcard for Bob next year in China. But my gut tells me the spending will start coming as they see some stability in the consumer and some travel and investments. But we're in pretty good shape right there right now. Robert Sharp : Yes, but the picture we have on '21 is China gets positive in Q2 and stays positive. But again, the magnitude is hard to say so. David Farr : Yes. It's very hard. Thanks, Andy. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : So a couple of questions. Could you just talk about how you guys are doing in Automation Solutions relative to your peers? Do you think it's an opportunity to take market share? I think some of your competitors had some reorg. How is the market share trending in this downturn? David Farr : It's pretty hard. We've got one quarter on it right now -- or two quarters, let's say. I would say if I look at the Final Control business, I would say Ram and his team have done a phenomenal job in Final Control in the last several quarters both in execution -- I think that they'll probably end up down somewhere around 5% or 6% this year, both in orders and sales. That is better than historically. We would -- if you think about the combination of our Final Control and V&C, Final Control, they're doing much better. He's raising his profitability. His GP margins are doing better. His cash flow is doing better. So I would say, on that side of the business, we're winning. And I just had a site review with them, and I like both -- we're making technology investments. On the Systems side, I'd say we're doing pretty well. We had Systems this quarter, which we didn't -- not in there. But I would say in Systems, we're up for the quarter. What are we up overall? Lal Karsanbhai : Actually, we were down sales for the quarter, 7%. But compared to the down 11% to 15% on peers. David Farr : Okay. So we're down 7% overall. Okay. So we had a decent quarter in Systems. I think in instrumentation, not much movement on that thing from that perspective. So overall, in a quarter, I feel good about where we are, but I'm thinking about the next 2 or 3, 4 quarters, I think we are well positioned. The key issue for us, Andrew, is the execution around the plant moves right now. The technology moves are pretty good, but the plant moves because if we -- that's how we lose share if we're not able to deliver. So the key issue for me right now, if we continue to invest and get the plant moves done, then as the economy gets better, I would say we're going to have a good move in the downturn, and we'll pick up share. But 1 quarter is a good sign, but we got several quarters more to go, but I like where we sit at this point. Lal Karsanbhai : And Dave, just to add on to your Systems, on the power side with Ovation, that's been a phenomenal quarter, and they were positive. David Farr : They were positive. Lal Karsanbhai : They were positive. David Farr : That's right. They're positive. I got the wrong one. Okay. Next one, Andrew? Andrew Obin : Yes, just a follow-up on facility moves. Can you just give us more color? I mean you had a head start on everybody else because you announced your program several months before that. But what are the challenges of moving facilities in the midst of COVID and this huge sort of whipsaw effect in terms of manufacturing? And how have you adjusted your plans in terms of facility moves? David Farr : So it takes a lot of planning, let's put it that way. And we've moved some plans in and out based on the areas of where we can get people in and out. One of the problems we will face is that we're not able to fly resources around the world right now. So we're going to depend on our local resources, both in Latin -- in Americas or Asia or in Europe. And typically, we would be flying resources around. But from our standpoint, we probably -- we planned so that they're going to take a little longer, Andrew. And we have had a couple from the standpoint we might have moved a month or 2 : one, as we work with the government; and also two, relative to resources. So on average, I would say they're on track. We've had a couple of slippage. But I think we've planned in -- this COVID thing was something we knew was coming at us. And so as we finalized the plans and we started moving these plans, we have that pretty well in shape at this point in time. The big issue we would face, Andrew, to be all honest, if we had a huge breakout of COVID in, say, certain parts of the region we have a plan going into, that would clearly slow us down. Fortunately, knock on wood, we have not had that yet. But that's something we actually reviewed with the Board today, the more -- what I'd call the more challenging moves that we have underway, both in Lal's business and Bob's business, to make sure the Board understands the magnitude of what we're trying to do. As you know, we restructure all the time, but this is a much higher magnitude, and we are in the middle of COVID. But so far, the teams around the world have done a great job, and I expect them to execute on them, and I feel good about it. Andrew Obin : And if I could just squeeze one more, just that Google mobility data, it does line up with your industrial orders. Is that a fair statement? Lal Karsanbhai : If I may, Dave? David Farr : Yes, go ahead. Lal Karsanbhai : The Google mobility data, what we did, Andrew, is we took -- we segmented purely the commuting hours. It's North America data only. Obviously, as you know, that it is an opt-in location tracking data, the location services data offering with Google phones. But it does track very well to daily bookings in North America. David Farr : You've got to pick the location, facilities and cities. And so that's what these guys -- we know where the facilities are. We know the customers. And it does seem to track pretty well. Andrew Obin : Yes. Just wanted to clarify. David Farr : Yes, it's nice that people are monitoring all of this right now. And so I go back and put the work, it makes me feel real good. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Charles Tusa : What was -- what do you think price cost is going to end up for this year? What are you guys embedding? David Farr : I think we have positive price this year. Price cost will be slightly positive. I mean these guys are looking at the chart right now. Frank would be the key for this. It'd be less than 1. I mean less than 1. We've had -- obviously, with a good net material inflation, and we had pricing set in earlier on, I think that will cause us to have to give some of it back next year. Robert Sharp : Our second half is in the half to a full point positive. David Farr : Yes. So overall, Steve, I think it would be less than... Robert Sharp : Certainly positive for the year. David Farr : Yes, less than 1% positive. Charles Tusa : I mean -- but that's price or price cost? David Farr : That's price cost. Charles Tusa : Okay. Got it. Got it. So 1% on the margin front is what you're saying? David Farr : Yes. Yes. And I think we're tracking pretty well right where we said to you at the beginning of the year. Yes. Charles Tusa : And then just on this CR&S business, I mean, these OEMs are obviously talking about like eye-popping order numbers here in June and July. Some guys, up, like, 50%. Are you guys like -- is there -- you're basically saying you guys are having kind of like fulfillment issues. And then beyond that, I guess, into the kind of back part of the year into the kind of the calendar fourth quarter, they're also kind of being a little bit cautious. Do you think the market goes from being a heat-driven market where the consumer is going to do what they have to do to have -- to stay cool to a market in the fourth quarter that kind of recouples more to the fundamentals of the consumer? In other words, high unemployment and weak consumer confidence. I mean is that kind of -- is that what's on the board right now as far as the variables you're looking at? Or is that the wrong way to look at it? Robert Sharp : Well, part of the popping now is April was pretty dramatic the other direction. On a dollar basis, our June orders for HVAC in North America were 2x what they were in April. And I think our customers have talked about it, and we talked about it, where there were a number of plants down and sometimes for as much as a couple of weeks. David Farr : Our customers. Robert Sharp : Our customers and then even us in April as we first kind of learned how to deal with the first COVID incidents inside and cleaning and other things like that. So again, part of this is a makeup. I think the -- I mean you read the reports, I read the reports, distribution has gotten very thin. There's a lot of examples of wholesalers and others considering other brands because one particular supplier can't do it. We supply them all. So we see that dynamic play out. And so it's very strong right now. I think there's a bit of a pent-up both of getting channel back established as well as certainly the sell-through with the heat in June and July. About 35% or so of the units are heat pump units. So they are relevant for the wintertime as well. And you got a lot of people sitting at home and, frankly, sitting on a decent amount of cash with the unemployment benefits, which is probably not skewed to homeowners exactly. So bottom line is, I think the -- I don't think there's a reason this won't stay pretty strong through the season and also to get the channel in play, in step for coming out of the season. It's really thin right now. David Farr : So Steve, right now, I think we see a couple of quarters of pretty good demand here, a little bit different. Again, the key issue for us, like with them, when I -- we're shipping right now. We're keeping up with them. It's a strong demand. We're keeping up with them. The big issue to us is, clearly, if all of a sudden you had an outbreak in where our plants are located and their plants are located, a supply chain disruption, right now, we are -- we went from basically not producing much to full out, to what you're talking about. And so that's where we are at this point in time. We are able to keep up with them, and we're working it pretty hard. And the key issue for us is we've got to keep those plants running, and we've got to keep the plants running safely. It's one thing to run a plant full out when you're in a non-COVID environment. When you're in a COVID environment, you have to be very, very careful to not stretch the workforce and also have something get in there and create an environment where you have half the plant come down with COVID. So we're running hard right now, and we're keeping up with them. But I'm always concerned that one break as we've seen it, both at our customers' level and our level. So this is something I feel the demand is there, and we're going to see it for the next couple of quarters, and we'll keep going at it. And so someone said the housing market's going to be pretty good, and so we're going to see construction and things like that and repair. Just -- we just got to keep the plants running and the supply chain going, which right now we are. Charles Tusa : One last one for you just on software. I don't even know if you guys track kind of software sales outside of the Systems business. But any way to give us any color on that kind of line item or that metric? I know you guys don't pretend to be a software company like some others do, but are you seeing growth in those areas? Or is that just kind of like in that Systems and services bucket on the Automation side? Lal Karsanbhai : Steve, Lal here. Yes. No, as we spoke about in New York, the software business is predominantly in the Systems side, although we do have a significant and growing amount of software that's outside of that sits in our digital transformation business. The software within Systems is closely tied to Ovation and DeltaV. That's embedded in there. The stand-alone software packages, albeit smaller in scale, over $0.5 billion in size already today, continue to grow and continue to grow not at the rate that we expected, obviously, back in New York, but it continued to be positive there and very -- continues to be very interesting... Charles Tusa : Sorry, did you say $0.5 billion for that business? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. The stand-alone software. David Farr : Yes, $0.5 billion. Lal Karsanbhai : $0.5 billion. Operator : Our final question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just the first question, David, on how you're thinking about capital deployment at this point. The buyback, you've kept a ceiling on it for the past few months now. In general, you're seeing global M&A start to warm up again after a freeze. How are you thinking about acquisitions at this point? David Farr : So right now, we're going to keep the hold on the share repurchase for the rest of, I would say, this quarter. And then we reviewed it with the Finance Committee this morning. We'll review it again, the next finance -- coming in at the end of this fiscal year. Right now, we are focusing very much on acquisitions. We have several things underway. As you said, they are freeing up and working that. If we get into a period that we're not able to close acquisitions and we see, obviously, from a cash flow standpoint, that we have the flexibility to do the share repurchase, we'll quickly go to that. But right now, as we talk to the Board, we're focusing pretty hard at some unique opportunities around the acquisition front that we'd like to get done here in the next quarter or so. So that's what we're looking at. But if they don't happen, obviously, we generate cash, then we'll look at, again, reinstituting the share repurchase. Most likely, we will reinstitute the share repurchase in fiscal '21, but I don't know the magnitude of it right now. It really is a function of can we close any acquisitions here in the rest of this calendar year. So that's how we're looking at it, Julian. Julian Mitchell : And then just a quick follow-up, maybe for Lal on the Automation Solutions backlog. I think you'd said, Lal, that, that was flattish or stable sequentially ending the June quarter. The sales decline is obviously a lot less than the orders decline that you've seen. And so that suggests you're sort of pulling revenue down from that backlog into the P&L. How do you think the backlog trends from here, let's say, the rest of this calendar year? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, sure, Julian. So what we're planning, it's embedded in the plan that I communicated to you, is about a $300 million takedown in backlog, $4.8 billion on a fixed rate basis adjusted for currency. David Farr : $4.8 billion. Lal Karsanbhai : $4.8 billion at the end of September. David Farr : Which is a normal trend for us. Lal Karsanbhai : It's a normal trend. We took $96 million out in the month of July. So we're well on that path over the next 2 months, Julian. David Farr : Yes. So this is pretty -- I mean it's going pretty well. The orders are pretty well holding up there. The project business is going in there, and it's not cancellation. So our backlog's holding in there nicely. And Lal, and particularly around Final Control and in Systems, they're executing the backlog, and that's a good sign for us. And I think that's going to hold -- it will start building again as we go into next year. But this is... Lal Karsanbhai : Good execution in the plants, Dave. David Farr : Yes, the plants are up and running well right now. I'm more worried about some of Bob's business. Bob's had some businesses that have been jerked around. When you go minus 40 to plus 20, that's pretty tough to do in a plant level, especially if you've got COVID floating around out there. And so that's the concern we have with Bob. But overall, I think that, as I wrap it up here, I want to -- again, I want to thank everyone joining us today. Again, I want to thank everybody out there across Emerson who worked so hard to make this quarter happen. We delivered a quarter we laid out. We were one of the few companies that laid it out as we did. We delivered it. We did better job execution around the cash flow and the earnings. And I feel very confident that we are well structured to go through this final quarter and really have a good rest of this calendar year, which would be our first quarter, too. And so it's just a question of where this thing, trend line, goes and just working hard to keep things going, get the restructuring done, generate the earnings and then also make sure we make those long-term investments we have to make. So I feel good where we sit today. Earnings, cash and momentum is on our side. Organization is pretty strong. And so I look forward to a good finish to the year, and we'll go forward with that. And I appreciate everyone joining us today. Thank you very much. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

This conference is being recorded today, November 3, 2020. Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Pete Lilly, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead. Pete Lilly : Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to Emerson's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Today, I am joined by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Lal Karsanbhai, Executive President of Emerson Automation Solutions; and welcoming Jamie Froedge, our New Executive President of Emerson Commercial & Residential Solutions. As usual, I encourage everyone to follow along in the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Starting with the cover slide. Despite the overarching challenges of COVID-19, Emerson has continued to invest in key technologies and solutions for future growth and value creation. We are excited to welcome OSI Inc. to the Emerson family, a leading provider of software-based technology for advanced grid management. Additionally, we also welcome Progea Group to Emerson, a leader in software-based HMI, SCADA and analytics solutions. We will also be -- we will also review other important strategic 2020 acquisitions later in the call. Now please turn to Slide 3. Similar to last quarter, I'd like to briefly highlight the Emerson Corporate Social Responsibility report, which is available on our website, emerson.com. This document reviews in detail many of Emerson's aspirations and accomplishments within the environmental, social and governance realms. Many of these important topics remain at the forefront of the national and international conversation. As problem solvers at our core, Emerson strives to advance the discussion, share our own progress and strategies and also be a valued resource for our customers as they embark on their own individual sustainability journey. Emerson takes very seriously our role as a critical enabler and partner for digital monitoring, measurement, control, optimization and efficiency management across our broad customer base. Fundamentally, we believe that this role and responsibility aligns very well with the broader purpose and goals of the sustainability movement. I encourage everyone to read the CSR report if you have not yet had a chance to do so. Please turn with me to Slide 4, and we will review some highlights of the quarter and the fiscal year. First, Emerson remains steadfast in our commitment to health and safety for our employees, customers and communities. Business continuity, serving our customers in critical industries, disciplined cost control and positioning to outperform as we emerge from COVID-19 remain our key thematic priorities. Next, we continue to work hard to ensure that our localized supply chains and operations remain stable, safe and productive. Turning to performance. Emerson executed well in a challenging but stabilizing demand environment. The organization was able to deliver adjusted earnings per share of $1.10 in the quarter and $3.46 for the full year, a strong finish driven by our ongoing aggressive cost reset actions, which totaled $73 million of restructuring actions in the quarter and over $300 million for the full year. Cash flow in the quarter was very strong, representing 128% conversion of net earnings and 6% growth year-over-year. It is important to highlight the balance -- that the balance and market diversity and stability of our 2 platform business portfolio was critical to enabling a strong operational and cash flow outcome. Savings for the year on both restructuring and COVID-related cost actions totaled approximately $370 million. And we were able to manage decremental margins to 21% at adjusted EBITDA. Despite all the uncertainty and demand challenges, sales and orders finished squarely in line with guidance given in August. Commercial & Residential Solutions orders turned sharply in the quarter, ending up 6% on a trailing 3-month basis. We now expect this business platform will turn positive to sales growth earlier than previously expected. Overall, as we look towards 2021, management has adopted a conservative view given the uncertainty in the marketplace but continues to expect sales to turn positive in Q3. Now please turn to Slide 6, which summarizes results for the year. Both net and underlying sales growth finished towards the higher end of their guidance ranges at down 9% and 8%, respectively. Commercial & Residential Solutions came in slightly ahead of expectations at down 7% underlying. Adjusted EPS of $3.46 was above the guidance range of $3.20 to $3.35, and restructuring actions finished slightly above guidance of $300 million. Despite lower sales, both platforms executed well on profitability with the COVID-19-related cost control measures, in addition to the ongoing aggressive restructuring reset actions. Finally, cash flow performance for the year was strong with both operating and free cash flow finishing above guidance. Turning to Slide 7. We will briefly bridge full year adjusted earnings per share. Starting with adjusted EPS in 2019 of $3.69, we subtract $0.13 for foreign exchange, pension and other items. Tax, share repurchase and interest added $0.17, which partially offset operational headwinds totaling $0.27. The operational headwinds from COVID-19 were broadly mitigated by restructuring and cost-containment efforts. This left adjusted EPS for the year at $3.46. Turning to Slide 8, we will review the results of the quarter. GAAP EPS of $1.20 was up 3%, while adjusted EPS of $1.10 was down 4%. Total net sales were down 8% with underlying sales finishing down 9%. Importantly, both underlying sales and orders for the consolidated company showed improvement from last quarter. Automation Solutions underlying sales were down 11%, and trailing 3-month underlying orders were down 19%. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales were down 3%, while trailing 3-month orders were up 6%. Cash flow performance was strong in the quarter with operating cash flow of $1.23 billion and free cash flow of $1.02 billion. Full year operating cash flow and free cash flow of $3.08 billion and $2.55 billion were up 3% and 6% over prior year, respectively. Lastly, the company continued and built upon its aggressive cost-reset plan, initiating a total of $73 million of restructuring actions in the quarter. Turning to Slide 9, we will bridge adjusted EPS. Beginning with fourth quarter of 2019 adjusted EPS of $1.14, you can see that nonoperational items of foreign exchange effects, pension, tax and other items attracted a total of $0.07. This was somewhat offset by $0.03 from share repurchase and interest. Most importantly, operational deleverage was fully mitigated via cost-control actions. Overall, we finished the quarter at $1.10, $0.15 above consensus estimates. Moving to Slide 10. We will review the P&L in the quarter. Starting with gross margin, we saw a reduction of 150 basis points to 41.3% as deleverage and unfavorable mix were partially offset by favorable price cost. Importantly, SG&A as a percent of sales declined by 150 basis points as aggressive cost-control actions took effect. Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA margins, which exclude restructuring and related costs, increased 80 basis points and 140 basis points, respectively, also reflecting the cost-containment actions flowing through. Lastly, our effective tax rate dropped this quarter, driven by foreign subsidiary reorganization efforts. Of note, the adjusted EPS decline of approximately 4% was ahead of overall revenue decline of approximately 8%. Turning to Slide 11, we will look at underlying sales by geography. For the quarter, the Americas continued to show the steepest declines, down 13%, with the North American market also down 13%. Here, we saw strength in residential, life sciences, medical and food and beverage markets more than offset by weakness in most other end markets. Europe was down 5%, and Asia, Middle East & Africa was down slightly driven by growth in Southeast Asia. For the year, the Americas finished down 11% with the other 2 world areas each down a more modest 4%. Please join me on Slide 12, and we will discuss total business segment performance. Total segment adjusted EBIT margin decreased 30 basis points to 19.9%, reflecting aggressive cost-control measures and strong operational execution as sales declined. Total segment adjusted EBITDA deleverage was limited to 21% in the quarter. Meanwhile, adjusted pretax earnings increased 70 basis points to 18.4%. As previously highlighted, Q4 cash flow performance was strong given the challenging environment. Operating cash flow of $1.23 billion and free cash flow of $1.02 billion both increased year-over-year by 2%. Free cash flow represented 140% conversion of net earnings. Turning to Slide 14, we will review the business platforms. Automation Solutions underlying sales finished down 11% for the quarter as broad-based declines in most end markets were slightly offset by life sciences, medical and food and beverage markets. North America again saw the steepest declines, down by over 20%. Meanwhile, Asia, Middle East & Africa was slightly positive driven by India and Southeast Asia. Trailing 3-month underlying orders were down 19%, again, reflecting stagnant but stabilizing demand trends. Restructuring actions totaled $52 million across the platform, which brought the total to $244 million for the full year. The platform delivered on profitability in a very challenging demand environment. Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA margins were limited to down 80 basis points and down 20 basis points, respectively, reflecting the aggressive cost actions taking effect. Decremental margins were held to 26% at adjusted EBITDA. Lastly, the platform converted approximately $400 million of backlog, leaving an ending balance of $4.7 billion. Turning to Slide 15. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales were down 3% in the quarter. The Americas and Europe each had modest declines of 1%, while Asia, Middle East & Africa was more challenged at down 13%. As previously mentioned, trailing 3-month orders turned sharply in the quarter, finishing up 6% driven by residential and big box retail market demand. For the quarter, restructuring actions totaled $21 million, which brought the total figure to $52 million for the year. Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA margins were up 50 basis points and up 120 basis points, respectively, reflecting continued effective focus on profitability. Please turn to Slide 17, and we will introduce the first quarter guidance. We expect that underlying sales will be in the down 7% to down 6% underlying range as residential, life sciences, medical and food and beverage market growth is more than offset by challenging but stabilizing other process, discrete and commercial markets. GAAP EPS and adjusted EPS are expected to be $0.52 and $0.67, respectively, plus or minus $0.02. We expect adjusted EBIT margin to be 15.5% to 16% with adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 21.2% to 21.8%. Slide 18 introduces our full year 2021 guidance framework. First, management has a conservative outlook for the macroeconomic environment in 2021, given the ongoing COVID uncertainty. We assume that demand will continue to be challenging but stabilizing and gradually improving as companies, communities and governments continue to learn and operate and live with the virus as the year progresses. We also assume that there will be steady progress with regard to vaccine development and distribution during the fiscal year. Lastly, we assume there are no major operational or supply chain disruptions and that oil prices remain in the $35 to $50 range. With those assumptions in mind, we expect a flat underlying sales year with a range of down 1% to plus 2%. Automation Solutions is expected to be in the range of down 4% to down 1%, while Commercial & Residential Solutions is expected to grow between 4% and 7%. Expected total restructuring in 2021 now totals over $200 million with approximately $160 million coming from Automation Solutions, $30 million coming from Commercial & Residential Solutions, and the balance coming from corporate. We expect operating cash flow to come in at approximately $3.1 billion, capital spending of $600 million, resulting in free cash flow target of approximately $2.5 billion. Emerson intends to resume share repurchases in fiscal year 2021 in the amount of $500 million to $1 billion while concurrently maintaining optionality for further acquisitions should the opportunity arise. This allocation excludes the funding of the previously announced acquisition of Open Systems International, which closed on October 1, 2020. Additionally, we remain fully committed to our dividend program and plan to increase our dividend per share for 65th consecutive year. Within this framework, as management forecasted in April of 2020, we expect overall revenue to return to growth in the third quarter of 2021. Commercial & Residential Solutions is expected to return to growth earlier than originally expected, while Automation Solutions is expected to return to growth later in the year. GAAP EPS is expected to be $3.11, plus or minus $0.05, while adjusted EPS is expected to be $3.45, plus or minus $0.05. Lastly, we do expect to encounter some profitability headwinds in the year. These include the return of some COVID-related costs as business conditions slowly normalize, stock price changes and amortization costs from the OSI acquisition. Also of note, we expect price costs to be less positive in 2021 and pension costs to be a tailwind for the year. And now please turn to Slide 19, and we will review the updated reset restructuring and COVID-related savings summary. Due to the delayed recovery in many automation markets, we are increasing restructuring spend within Automation Solutions in 2021, resulting in a total company restructuring spend of over $200 million, up from the $125 million shown last quarter. This increase in restructuring spend yields higher incremental savings in 2021 of approximately $245 million. We still expect that approximately $70 million of the $150 million COVID-related savings from 2020 will come back in 2021 as business conditions start to normalize in the back half. Total long-term annualized savings of the overall reset restructuring program are now expected to exceed $650 million. Please turn to Slide 21, and I will now hand the call over to Mr. David Farr. David Farr : Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Pete. And Jamie, welcome to the group here. James Froedge : Thanks, David. David Farr : And Frank, and obviously, Lal. But Chart 21 is clearly the underlying orders forecast, and I'll talk about that in a second. But first, I do want to welcome everybody from the investor world, the shareholder world, our employees, thanks for joining us today. And thank you for your continued support and engagement over this quarter and the total fiscal year. And as we all know, it's been a truly unusual fiscal year for this company, but I think this team has risen to the challenge. I want to make a special call out to the global Emerson employees, the leadership team and our new members from acquisitions this year and thank them for their commitment to safety, our customers, our fellow employees and shareholders and community as we return to work starting in March and throughout the years, we continue to reengage and be successful as a company. I want to appreciate -- I appreciate everything you've done. I want to thank you for the job you did. And thank you for everything you did over the last 8 months as we got back into our offices, as we got back in the manufacturing plants and we opened and produced product for our customers. I want to thank all of you very, very much. I know that this was not easy to do, but you all did it. You rose to the challenge. And you delivered to our customers, our shareholders and the communities and the fellow employees. As we know, 2020 was an exceptional year in sales, profit margins, earnings and cash flow. Our free cash flow to earnings, our conversion was close to 140% this year. It's our 64th year dividend increase. Our dividend free cash flow came in at 47.5%. As many of you know, we did not cut our dividend when we did the major repositioning back in 2016, and we've worked our way back into under 50% in free cash flow to dividend ratio. We returned over $2.1 billion to our shareholders this year in 2020. We kept our dividend going like many companies did not do, and we returned capital to our shareholders through share repurchase. And given what I see right now in underlying margin improvement, strong cash flow generation, growth returning in the Commercial & Residential Solutions business and I think that a business in Automation Solutions that will return in the second half of the year, we are going to increase our capital allocation back to the shareholders to get to $2 billion this year, as Pete talked about. This is something we feel strongly about, confidence in the company, how we position the company from a cost standpoint, the new products, the investments we've made in acquisitions. Clearly, we got a very uncertain political environment right now. But the investments we've made, we have a lot of confidence in that we'll be able to grow and outperform this marketplace and do well, at the same time make an investment internally by returning in more cash back to our shareholders. And I think that's very, very important to show that confidence to our shareholders that we will get our way through this. As you know, we sat here in April, gave a forecast for quarters, for the year and the first half of '20 and 2021. Very few companies did that. We delivered. We actually beat them as we went out through that quarter. We are 2 quarters ahead, and Commercial & Residential returned to growth, tremendous performance by the Commercial & Residential Solutions group. And the market's coming back. Great to see. They're leveraging. Their margins are really doing well based on all the restructuring that went on from 2019 throughout 2020. And they're ready to grow and expand those margins. We also believe that Auto Solutions, the cycle that we laid out back in August, we're probably 1.5 quarters behind that cycle, still some tough things ahead of us, but we feel quite strongly that business will return to growth in the second half of the year. But Lal and his team, they have confidence in delivering improved profitability and improved cash flow in 2021, has made the decision to increase, increase the restructuring in the first half of this year and all -- and mostly for -- in the second half of the year, but most importantly, in the first half of the year to drive higher margins even though sales are going to continue to be down in the first half of the year. That is not easy to do when you look at all the things they've been doing over the last 12 to 18 months. But I feel quite strong that they will deliver. The company is stronger. The balance sheet is stronger. I believe the underlying growth momentum will return. Our aggressive cost actions are self-help. We're on track to deliver the peak margin plan we laid out in February of 2020 despite sales being approximately $2 billion lower than we said back then before the pandemic, before, obviously, the recession we've had to go through. But the hard work on cost actions, the hard work in restructuring, the hard work in new product investments and the things we had to do to make this company stronger for our shareholders and for our customers, we have done. We have confidence in 2021. Yes, we still have problems ahead of us. Yes, we have an election going on today. Who knows what's going to happen? Yes, COVID virus is still out there. But we have confidence we'll have a vaccine. We have confidence that we'll move back into a more normal business environment as we go into the middle of 2021. We feel good that we can return more cash to our shareholders as we go into 2021. But again, before I go into the charts, I want to make a very special call out to our Emerson employees around the world, the Emerson leadership team, the corporate employees, the employees that stood by me and the OCE live in St. Louis, not live from Saturday Night Live, but live in St. Louis to get through this COVID pandemic environment. Live together, I want to thank them for making that happen. Clearly, we got some challenges. But clearly, I feel the company today is in a much stronger position than it was back in April when we talked, and I feel very good about what was going to happen as we go into the 2021 time period. As we laid out in Chart 21, chart you saw in 21, a lot of people said, \"How are you going to get back to the top of that lines, we were coming down?\" Well, we did, upper right-hand corner. Obviously, Commercial & Residential came back strong. Lal's business is going sideways right now as we continue to wait for America, KOB 3 and some KOB 2. He'll be talking about that. We've laid out some dots here. As we go forward into this quarter and how we think orders will trend in the first quarter, how orders would trend in the second quarter, this is the trend line we see -- we have to be on as a total company. How the various pieces move around, that will change depending on what happens each month. But we -- this is the trend line we have to be on to return to total growth for the total company by the second half of 2021. Again, as we sit here today, as we talked about in April of 2020, the midst of COVID, the forecast that we laid out is pretty well in line, except we're a little bit ahead for Commercial & Residential, and Lal's a little bit behind just from a recovery standpoint. He didn't go any deeper than we thought. But he has not recovered yet primarily because of KOB 3 in the turnaround business in North America, but we're seeing other parts of the world doing pretty well for Lal. If you go forward to Chart 22. Here's the forecast we laid out right now. On the first quarter, after delivering down 8.6% underlying growth in the fourth quarter this year, we're looking to be down somewhere in the 6% to 7%. I hope it'll be close to the 6%. As we look at October, you can -- I hope Jamie will comment on how we saw October. I hope Lal will comment how they saw October. But I think that we'll be down somewhere in the 6% to 7%. We'll get a little bit better as we move into the second quarter, and then we'll get better and go positives as we go into the third and fourth quarter. This is the same lines that we drew out in the last year in April. The only difference is right now, we clearly have the uncertainty of the election. We clearly have the uncertainty of how the COVID will continue to move and impact the rest of the world. But we feel confident that we can control some of our own destiny for underlying growth and also improvement in profitability and cash flow as we go into '21. As I look at the Auto Solutions business, and I'm going to turn it over to Lal right now to talk about what he sees, but it's very important to see that I think the momentum will start shifting for you, Lal, as we go through this quarter. I want to take the hats off to you and your whole team in the restructuring. Many people in this phone don't know how hard it is to restructure and do what you're doing. And my hats off to what you've got done. I know what -- how proud you guys are on the team, but this is not easy work. So it's your mic. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you. Thank you, David, for those words. It's very meaningful for all of us in the business. It was an extraordinary year as you described, and I'm so grateful and humbled by all the efforts and the results that this team delivered. Very proud, as you said. A few words, if I may, on 2020. The second half of 2020 was weaker than we expected when we first talked, David, back in April as we reset the plan. And we did not see that acceleration in orders in the second half, in the latter half of the year as we expected into Q4. However, the team did a tremendous job, and I'll call out 5 fronts here : the first being identifying and executing the restructuring programs; secondly, converting $400 million of backlog in the second half of the year, meeting that commitment that we had made; thirdly, growing our life science and medical segment by over $100 million in sales value through the year, that's through participation gains in therapeutics, in vaccine development as well as medical PPE manufacturing; fourthly, stay committed to the digital transformation journey across our business; and then lastly, working very, very diligently on the diversification and software elements of our business, including through acquisition and internal development. So just tremendous work across the business to deliver 26% quarterly adjusted EBITDA leverage and 23% annual adjusted EBITDA leverage on almost $1.5 billion down sales. So great work on the year. Now turning to '21. We do expect 2 additional challenging quarters in the first half prior to turning positive in the second half of the year as we laid out the plan here. So we are watching 3 key leading indicators in the business. First, the discrete industry orders and the inventory levels in the distribution channels. To David's earlier point, we are seeing some early encouraging signs through September, October, particularly in Europe and China driven by automotive. So that's encouraging to see as we've gone through the first month of this fiscal. Number two, the manpower presence in customer sites. If you recall, we had talked about back in August at a 40% level of manpower presence. That's moved now into the mid-70s through October. That's very encouraging as there will be a sign of moving from an environment of break fix into further KOB 2 and KOB 3 activity. And then lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the ultimate bell weather in this business is the rate of our short-cycle KOB 3 business in North America. And then again, as Pete pointed out, it's stable today, but we need to see an acceleration in the core market spending as we go through the quarter and into the second half of the year. Let's turn then to Page 24. I want to highlight 3 specific segments that performed extremely well over the calendar year 2020. There are over $650 million of sales represented on this chart across the platform. Life sciences on the left grew 15% in 2020. We have the leading DCS position in the life science industry with DeltaV, a position that has been invested in over time through both organic investment and acquisitions. We have over 3,000 DeltaV systems installed in the industry, including 1,200 across the top 20 pharmaceutical companies. The growth has been predominantly in two areas driven by COVID. The first has been therapeutics, and the second has been vaccine development and production, where we are engaged in over 20 of the 160 vaccine efforts underway around the world. In the middle part of the chart is our medical business, which grew 40% in 2020 driven by two predominant applications : mask manufacturing, where we use ultrasonic welding machines instead of, for example, glue to assemble masks; and secondly, valves and regulators for ventilators and oxygen therapy devices for patient treatment. And then lastly but very important is our clean fuels and renewable businesses. We are well positioned -- we have a well-positioned portfolio that grew 10% this year to really capitalize on this macro trend. There are 2 key areas here : number one, enabling our core process customers to reach carbon neutrality and predominantly in the power and oil and gas industries; and secondly, we have the technology and application know-how for biofuels, biomethane applications as well as the growing field of clean hydrogen aimed at fuel cells for the long-haul mobility segment. So very encouraging, and we have a significant role to play here, particularly in that hydrogen value chain from production to distribution and utilization. We turn to Page 25. And I wanted to highlight 4 very significant investments that we made through the year. We continue to be acquisitive and really think about our -- expanding our served markets, diversifying our industry and increasing our software portfolio. So in 2020, we completed 3 acquisitions and made a fourth equity investment. The four investments, American Governor, OSI and Progea as well as inmation, support our strategy to drive end market diversification and strengthen the portfolio as I described. Our power industry diversification is driven by growth in renewables, hydro turbine controls and grid control and optimization. And we bought an HMI company in Progea that complements the PLC assets that we had acquired from General Electric. It really focuses on the hybrid and discrete segments.  And then lastly, inmation is a German-based, next-generation cloud native and OT data lake, which is a critical element for the continued success of our digital transformation business. And then lastly, I want to provide you with an update on our project funnel. So the funnel today is valued at $6.4 billion. That's down from the $7 billion when we last reviewed the funnel in April 2020. And David, we did not look at this since that period of time as we went through the last 6 months. So we have booked approximately $150 million out of the funnel since April to bring the total bookings from the funnel to $400 million for 2020, the significant bookings in Saudi Arabia as well as in the Arctic LNG. As a matter of fact, I would like to highlight the LNG wave. We've spoken at length with the investment community about the 8 jobs that have been committed through this set of wave -- to this wave. We have won 54% of the available automation dollars to date, and there are an additional $600 million to be bid over the next year or so. So a tremendous job across all the automation businesses, but I'll take my hat off particularly to the Final Control business that has participated in every single one of the 8 jobs to date. So a great job there. There has been about $800 million of value that's been removed from the funnel. The single biggest cancellation is about $200 million. That's a Saudi crude to chemical job that was just moved out. And then we've had about $700 million of projects that have shifted into -- from '21 into '22 and beyond. So that's occurred. And then the last thing I'll say is $500 million of project additions into the funnel. These are particularly, on average, smaller projects and concentrated in gas globalization in the power generation segment. David Farr : Before we turn it over to Jamie, I just want to thank Lal and the team for a couple of things here. One, major effort on the restructuring cost reductions to get -- driving the margins back up, the peak margin improvement and to drive higher margins in 2021 they're going to have, even though sales are still going to struggle for them in the first half of the year. But I also want to say that they made sure they made the right investments. As we had site reviews, as we did talks and had WebExes or face-to-face meetings, we made sure we talked about the new products, the next-generation technologies. We wanted to make sure that we continue to make the right investments. They've got the right monies where they need to be to make sure we did not jeopardize the future franchises within this company. And at the same time, we made some very unique, as you saw, acquisitions that strengthen our hand in many, many core places that we think that will have long-term growth and long-term sustainability from the standpoint of value creation for Emerson and diversification for Emerson. So Lal and your team, a phenomenal job. So Jamie, your first call, I mean, I hate to say Bob Sharp set it up for you. And now you've got a growth, and you just got to keep the plants open and start growing. You've got a growing tiger in your hands. So here it is, let me -- let's talk about it. James Froedge : Yes. I was in Asia, working with Lal as we were working through the depth of the COVID impact, and it's great to come back here to see that the team put a tremendous number of investments in place, both in terms of improving our operational capabilities and transforming our structures and our business, so that we can have improved profitability as we grow going forward, but they also invest in the technology. And as we go through these charts, I think you'll see a combination of those two things. Looking at Chart 27, we saw a return to growth in underlying sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 across many of our product lines driven by strength in the North America residential markets. We also experienced sequential improvement across our businesses as the quarter unfolded. Trailing 3-month orders in September were 6.4% and will improve to be double-digit as we finalize the October numbers. Residential markets globally typically represent between 40% to 50% of our mix in a given quarter, and North America is by far the largest portion of that. Inventory restocking across residential segments provided -- is providing additional order sales growth opportunities beyond the demand being driven by home sales and home improvement. So I think we're very well positioned for 5% to 6% underlying sales growth in the first quarter. Second quarter outlook in growth percentage is slightly lower than Q1 as we believe the inventory rebuild restocking activities will start to level out a little bit. And the North America A/C strength, we think, could continue potentially into fiscal third quarter, given seasonal trends. We see growth occurring in the Europe, heating and A/C technologies group businesses throughout the year and overall growth for the broader European portfolio returning in the second quarter. And Asia is on track right now to return to growth late Q1 or early Q2. Looking on to Chart 28. Home sales, home improvement, inventory restocking and our operational capabilities enabled strong Q4 North America residential A/C growth. Our strong partnerships with customers' ability to execute have allowed us to capitalize on these growth opportunities. Q1 '21 North America A/C will be up 20-plus percent with greater than 50% growth in the residential space alone. We've also been investing heavily during the downturn in technology and recently won an AHR Expo Innovation Award. The K7 compressor that you see on the chart will help prepare the industry to meet the new DOE efficiency standards, which go into effect January 2023. And this product line will support multiple refrigerant types, including lower-GWP refrigerants such as R32 and R454B. This product line will serve residential and commercial markets. On the right side of the chart, you can see the Sensi platform. Our Sensi thermostat sensing and analytics platform continues to outperform and has been recognized in the industry. Additionally, we have lots of exciting features on the way over the next couple of years. So we're very excited about how that space is unfolding. Moving on to Chart 29. Not only have market conditions created a growth opportunity in our wet/dry vac and InSinkErator businesses, but the investments in improved performance as well as new features, functions and product lines position us well in these spaces. Q4 combined sales for these businesses were up 10%. And as you can see on the chart, we expect an even stronger Q1 performance. Additionally, our main wet/dry vac competitor SharkVac has created a unique opportunity for us in the market to take our leadership to the next level. We are working very closely with our channel in that space, and we're putting in the appropriate investments to help serve the industry needs and accelerate growth. Looking at the bottom half of the chart, although the commercial and industrial spaces haven't returned to year-over-year quarterly growth, sequential improvement matched with our investments in new technology provide momentum into the second half of the year. On the chart, you can see multiple examples of products that we launched in fiscal 2020. So the team really stayed focused on innovation and launching new products. FlexShaft and pipe inspection enhancements in technology will increase our customers' productivity and provide features such as the combined cleaning camera visibility and the ability to see the pipe pitch during inspection. In our next-gen battery tools category that you can see on the right side of the chart, our RIDGID product shown increases cycles to a level 2x the normal time needed for service and provides cycles greater than the tool normally requires, making it essentially service free. The insulated tool shown can help protect a worker from accidentally cutting a live line up to 1,000 volts, a very unique and new feature for a battery hydraulic tool in this industry. The remote cable cutter product shown, which was awarded the Showstopper Award by the National Electrical Contractors Association allows the user to manage the jobs with a remote control, keeping them safely away from the cutting procedure. In partnering with users of our products, it has really helped us unlock innovative ways to improve their work experience, allowing them to be safer and more productive. On Chart 30, you can see our focus on product lines that help drive decarbonization served us very well in 2020 with strong year-over-year sales growth in European heat pumps and renewable natural gas compression orders. Multiyear growth in these spaces is expected to continue driven by market trends and in many cases, accelerating subsidy and decarbonization targeted policies. Just to wrap up, I'd say that given the current market conditions, we do see a solid first half fueled by residential markets, second half growth driven by improving nonresidential markets as those residential markets kind of ease into more sustainable growth rates. But I want to say this, as Dave and Lal said, how so proud I am of the team, their focus on safety, our people's safety, our customers' safety, operational excellence and margin improvement. But I'm really proud of them because they did all those things while maintaining the same intense focus on innovation as they had in all those areas, so that we can return this growth -- return to growth with enhanced products to serve our customers' needs. With that, I'll hand it back to, David, to you and Pete. David Farr : Thank you very much, Jamie. Again, I want to thank the commercial and residential organization for the work you got done. Bob, in 2018 and 2019 and the first half of 2020 really got into the restructuring. They kept the investments going. We knew that we return to growth. And they are that. But they have -- the return to growth of major new innovation, major new product portfolio is second to none. And I think it's pretty exciting. The markets are returning. The key issue for them right now is they have several plants within their structure running full out. In the midst of COVID, increased COVID, that's not easy to do. They have plants. They have to keep running and producing at record levels, and we have a major competitor to disappear on the marketplace. He will return, but we don't know exactly when. At the same time, they'll have other industries across their business that will start growing in the second half of 2020. So the team got ready for this. They executed. And I give them high marks. Before I go to Q&A, just want to make a couple of comments here. First of all, 2020 was my 20th year as CEO, a year that I'll never forget. We started out with activism. Then we launched a massive, massive restructuring effort across the company to drive increasing margins in a tough year. And then we just happen to have this thing called COVID-19 pandemic with a resulting recession around the world. But the Emerson team rose to this challenge, and we drove, I think, less down sales than people thought. Our earnings minimization of the decreasing was less than people thought. And we drove increased cash flow, a very strong 2020. Some people say, \"Well, what are you going to do for us in 2021?\" Well, we had a heck of a 2020. We've got a little bit tougher base to come off of, but we're going to make 2021 a better year.\" As I move into my final year as the Emerson CEO, I think our plans to drive top line growth, improve margins and earnings and cash flow, as we get into the second half of the year, are very strong and very positive. And we'll be ready to hand this over to the next CEO and his leadership team, and I want to thank everyone for that support. But we've got a tough 2000 -- 2021 ahead of us. But we -- I think we have a lot of confidence that we can deliver improved sales, earnings and cash flow and turn that over to that next leadership team as Mr. Knight get back to me in early 2020. So with that, we'll open the mic for Q&A. So let us have it. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Congrats to Jamie. Glad they've had the chance to meet you a few years back in Austin. Good luck in the new position. James Froedge : Thanks, Jeff. Look forward to seeing you again soon. Jeffrey Sprague : Yes, absolutely. Well, Dave, I mean, you've been signaling your impending retirement for a while, but you made some pretty explicit comments just there, right? I think, I guess, some of us have nothing better to do than speculating whether you're going to stay around longer and all that sort of thing. So really, my question -- first question is, though, how does this play out? What's kind of the timing of naming your successor? And how long a transition period might there be? David Farr : From the standpoint, that's obviously a Board decision. I mean I'm just one member of the Board as Chairman, Chairman of the Board. But as I basically be communicating, I would say that we will name my successor sometime in late 2021, in second half of 2021. In my opinion, there will be very little transition. I mean it's up to the next CEO, does he even need Dave Farr, the old man around. We can hear. People would so many -- okay. Someone came in, and said they can't hear us, but I think they can hear us. They -- yes, I thought so. And so I think that what will happen is what Mr. Knight did to me is I got announced. He threw the keys in my chest and said, \"It's all yours. I'm out of here.\" And so I'll probably throw a couple of bats at him and a couple of rally monkeys and say, \"I'm out of here. Give me a call if you need me.\" And I think that Emerson management team is strong. They don't need old farts like me around. Maybe I know how to fight COVID, maybe I know how to fight recessions, but I will -- my door is always open. My keys -- the house is always open for people to ask me questions. So it'll be quick, bam-bam. And I'm not a big believer in transition. The guys will be ready. They don't need Dave. And so that's where it is right now. But I would say I'm in charge still, and I will most likely name it with the Board sometime in late 2021. That's how it looks right now, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Yes. We'll definitely miss you when that day comes. I had a question for Lal, too, is just a follow-up, and I'll pass the baton. David Farr : Just assuming I don't die in between now and then, okay, Jeff, okay? Jeffrey Sprague : Yes. No, please don't. Stay safe. On -- Lal, on the KOB 3, I mean, everything you said was pretty crystal clear. I'm just wondering, though, in terms of dialogue with customers or other indicators that you look at, do you actually have some visibility on when this may begin to turn? And can you just level set us, too, so we have the base correct? What was KOB 3 as a percent of the total mix for 2020? Lal Karsanbhai : Jeff. Yes. Thank you. So KOB 3, right now, we're still crunching the numbers. We'll be close to flat from 2019. That was 57% of sales in 2019. That's what we expect right now. And the reason for that, I actually expected it to come up. The reason it hasn't is that we had a significant drop-off in the latter half of the year, particularly in that short-cycle business, instrumentation and the discrete side and consequently impacted Q3. So it sits at flattish to 2019. That's the way to think through it right now, Jeff. Now in terms of indicators, there are a couple of others. The shutdown turnaround activity is a very relevant indicator to us of KOB 3 activity on sites. We talked about at the prior earnings call of what occurred in spring and the summer shutdowns. They obviously didn't occur. We have seen reschedule of activity into the fall, and we acted -- actively working those now. I will tell you that they tend to be more systems-driven upgrades than valves and instrumentation right now. So whether it's cybersecurity upgrades or various other things, that's what they're really focused on. So we haven't seen a tremendous uplift yet in what will drive core device, valve instrument uplift in new orders. So that's another one to watch carefully. And then last, Jeff, I will mention just it is important what I stress in terms of getting the customer back on site. And we're watching those numbers very carefully, and that will be a telltale sign to activity. But ultimately, as you and I talked, Jeff, in the past, it's got to be demand-driven. You've got to see that underlying demand in the end products come back versus an acceleration. David? David Farr : Thanks. We just -- what we're talking about internally, people who dialed in can hear us, but the people on the WebEx couldn't hear us. Pete Lilly : They can't. David Farr : I think it was with Jeff because I told him I was retiring and stepping down next year. They all cut off. Jeffrey Sprague : You blew up the website, yes. David Farr : I blew up the website. They said, \"Oh my God.\" Celebrations, people are saying like, \"God, we finally got rid of this guy after 40 years.\" Operator : Our next speaker is Josh Pokrzywinski, and he is from Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : A couple of questions for me. I guess, first, just looking at the Auto Sol orders and how they've been trending the last few months, not just what we've seen here more recently in September and trying to square that away with the outlook for fiscal '21. And I guess, part of that mix is also considering that you guys said you did a better job of working down some of the backlog. So carrying a little less backlog into the year, if I understand it right. It seems like orders are still a little mushy, and the underlying sales outlook doesn't quite jive with it. What am I missing in that? And what should we watch for that order cadence to really need to pick up to support it? I see the chart in there, obviously, but any milestones that you would really need to hit on? David Farr : I'll give you my two cents, and I'll give the expert, Lal. But -- and my two cents is what we're still watching for is North America, U.S.A. KOB 3. And we are not -- and we're seeing some early life on that and some planned turnaround right now. But we're not expecting anything of substance to return to that until we get into the new calendar year. So we're going sideways. And then what we expect going to happen is those investments will start unfolding in the U.S.A. We'll start seeing some additional investments in aftermarket and some KOB 2 coming in, allowing us to have a little bit of growth in the second half of the year. So we're watching, and we'll continue to communicate to you all about this KOB 3 when we start seeing it happen. The problem will be if we get into February, March, April and we don't see any turnaround in KOB 3, if something happens, that will be a problem for Lal and his business. So that's why he has chosen to do additional restructuring in the first half of the year and the first quarter in particular to try to give some protection as this thing -- as we wait for this thing to turn. But that's the way we look at it right now. We've been here before. It is probably a little bit on the -- as we say on the comm, for the second half of the year. But I feel confident that the customers will start spending as we see that capital coming in. So Lal, why don't you go ahead and give what you feel? You're the expert. Lal Karsanbhai : No, I think you're an expert. You said it well, David. We've been running between $38 million and $40 million a day in bookings. And through October, that has not changed. We actually expected to see a drop-off in October. We did not see it. It stayed very stable at $39 million a day in October. David Farr : That's good. Lal Karsanbhai : Which is good, which is good. So David, you're absolutely right. We've got to watch that KOB 3 environment, Europe, North America predominantly and Asia, very telling as to the pace of business as we see those early short-cycle orders come in. But I will also say that there are elements where we can control our own destiny. We've set very aggressive new product sales goals, our competitive displacement activities that we worked in the power industry and are now working in the chemical segment and then really going after the life cycle and the medical opportunities that are out there in our business. David Farr : So Josh, what we'll do, as you know, we are a company that puts out orders and dialogue. What we'll come in to do, Lal and I will commit to the shareholders right now and obviously, the sell-side analysts here, is we'll continue to put out any dialogue we see on the day-to-day, the daily order number that he just put out there, $39 million a day right now. And also, most importantly, the North America KOB 3. That's what you got to watch. That's what we're watching. And the fact that the plants now are getting a 70% population, that's a good sign. That means they're getting ready, and they'll start spending money. They have to spend money or those plants will have safety or quality issues. And that's not a good thing for the facilities we operate in. So that's what we're watching, Josh. Lal Karsanbhai : And it's perhaps a... Joshua Pokrzywinski : That's helpful. Lal Karsanbhai : Sorry, Josh. Perhaps anecdotal, but I'll throw it out. Customers are actually inviting us into sites, that particular business line in Houston in a couple of weeks. So that's encouraging, again, as we see activity pick up. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Yes. Just a quick follow-up. I heard both Lal and Jamie mentioned restocking in some of their comments. Any sense on what that might be embedded in the guide over the next presumably not more than the next 1 or 2 quarters, but whatever time frame you want to say that that's baked into numbers, how much of that is restocked? David Farr : So yes, I'll let Jamie answer that. But the restocking mostly will be in Jamie's side of the business. Lal only have -- he's watching restocking on the hybrid and the discrete side, the early stages of that because inventories have been taken way down. So Jamie has the biggest restocking going on because the -- his customer base liquidate inventory when we went into COVID, demand came up, and now he's behind the curve. So why don't you do your... James Froedge : Yes, that's right, Dave. I mean, it's -- I hate to give you a little bit of answer, but it's a little hard to tell right now because these levels were taken down so low historic levels. Big box retailers, the CEOs in those spaces have been very public about their comments about what happened there. They took them down almost nothing. Our A/C industry did the same thing. So what you have is there's a lot of noise in the system right now as they chase -- people are chasing to restock inventories. There's real demand by home improvement and home sales. And we don't know how long that cycle is going to last. So if you ask the A/C folks, I think right now, how much of this is going to be restocking versus real demand, it's too early to tell because the cycle could run into the third quarter, if you have a hot summer. By the time you catch up to the demand we're seeing right now and you get caught up, all of a sudden, you hit peak season, and it could keep running. So we're seeing similar things. How long does SharkVac have challenges supplying the industry? Okay, we're not sure yet. So there's a lot of unknowns. And I think we'll have more clarity as we get into the first part of the calendar quarter -- first quarter of calendar year, it will get a little more clearer to us. David Farr : So Josh, what we're looking at right now from my -- this is Dave's expertise from being 40 years in the company and 20 years as CEO is we're adding capacity in Jamie's business right now. I think we have a unique window here to pick up some share. Jamie and his team are -- I mean, the innovation that Jamie inherited from Bob and those guys is phenomenal. And I think that we have a unique opportunity. So we're adding capacity at this point in time. At the same time we have -- we're running at peak levels, we're adding capacity. Right now, Lal's business is -- we're more interested in getting some of the capacity moved around into a better cost structure, and he's got to get that done because he doesn't want to be in the position that Jamie is right now, where he's trying to do some massive restructuring with capacity moving out. So we're betting on things will get better in Jamie's business and that the restocking will go and then the paid online business will continue to go, assuming nothing happens relative to the election or some crazy happens with the COVID. But we're adding capacity in Jamie's business right now because we think we'll be better as we get into the second half of this year. James Froedge : The only other comment I would add is that as you look at our first half outlook for sales, especially first quarter, we are being prudent right now, though, as we assess those orders. So I don't want to give the exact numbers, but just know that as we see the orders unfolding, they're good. As I said, October is a double-digit quarters number. Again, we know some of that's restocking. And so we're being prudent in what we put into the sales forecast at this time. David Farr : But we'll keep you informed as we go forward -- as we go with the order. That's our vehicle to let you guys know think things are better or worse, okay? Operator : Next question comes from Gautam Khanna at Cowen. Gautam Khanna : My question is more on how you look at the business with the oil and gas exposure because time and again, we hear from investors that this is not just a cyclical challenge. It's more secular as the world moves to alternative fuel sources and the like, and how Emerson is going to react and position to be ahead of that trend and maybe help in that trend with your customers. If you could just talk a little bit about your perspectives on what might be a structural change and how the company is going to emerge on the other side of it. David Farr : Yes. I mean it definitely is a structural change, Gautam. And if you look at this year's sales as a percent of our total sales, we're going to be down to 23%, 24% as a total company. As we continue to invest in other technologies, as we make acquisitions, we are still a major supplier, a very important supplier, especially in KOB 3, which if you look in the oil and gas industry, our KOB 3 is probably closer to 70%. It's primarily an aftermarket business. So what we'll do, and we'll talk more about this in February, but we're continuing to make investments in the next-generation renewables, be it hydrogen, be it hydro, be it the investment we made in the -- in OSI power. We continue to make investments around other uses of power and energy to replace oil and gas. We'll continue to do that. But we're not going to -- it's not something you can say, okay, we're going to sell that segment off because a lot of the technologies we use from a DeltaV or sensors or pressure or whatever we're doing are very similar to what we use in other industries. But I think what you're going to see, we'll continue to serve this industry. At the same time, we'll continue to invest in other technologies. As we talk to the Board today about the innovation we're doing in the medical field and also are doing the sensing field and other -- in the renewable fields, we'll continue to do that. So that percentage will continue to move downwards. We're still -- we're not going to walk away from it. Don't -- we can have a spike as they make investments come back in it, but we fundamentally believe as we look -- show the Board the pieces of the pie of where Emerson is going, it will continue to be smaller and smaller. We'll continue to grow, and we'll continue to make those investments to allow us to have a more balanced portfolio. I think people are way overestimating how much oil and gas we have in this company and way overestimating the impact as we make this transition. We've been making this transition for some time now over the last several years, and we'll continue to make it. At the same time, we'll continue to make those investments. So I feel very good on where we are right now. We're working very, very hard with our customers from a renewable standpoint, and we'll share that with you in February, so people are going to have that. But I think people have to understand we as a Board, we as a management team understand we have a very strong presence in oil and gas. We'll continue to invest to try to diversify, but we're not going to walk away from that cash cow that we have from the standpoint of that business segment today. So I think that from the standpoint of what I see also is the good news happening is the consolidation of this industry. That's going to be good for the short term, and that will help us as people consolidate. But in the meantime, we're continuing to invest to diversify. We'll continue to be a player, but it will be less and less of a player. And I think people overestimate the impact of that because most of that business right now in oil and gas is around KOB 3 aftermarket. And by the way, if you go look at any forecast for the next 20, 30, 40 years, oil and gas is still the primary source of energy, and it's still growing. It doesn't mean you've got to make more double down on it, but it's still growing, and investments will come back. Got to have -- unless you don't want to have lights. Unless you want to be like California. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Charles Tusa : Speaking of dogs jumping over targets or whatever you used to say, I kind of calculate a bit more tailwinds just mechanically. You do have a bit of a tailwind, whether it's restructuring and some of these other things, buyback. So on kind of flat revenues, a flat EPS number, I know you got a little bit of tax headwind, some of these temporary costs coming back, but is there anything in the mix that we should be aware of? I mean KOB 3 is already kind of down. CR&S is a higher-margin platform that should outperform. So is there anything in the mix or anything like that? You've given us price cost. Anything in the mix that's negative that would be kind of holding you guys back from converting whatever little kind of revenue you get on top of some of these tailwinds? David Farr : No. Okay, Steve. I mean what we try to put forth for our shareholders, we had a very, very strong second half of the year. You know that. I mean our earnings per share, our margins, our cash flow is much better. One of the things that we're all worried about is my concerns about what happens in election, in particular in North America, what happens to the global -- if COVID comes back in our plans and things don't -- investments happening. But you're right. I would say that we put forth what I would call conservative forecast in a somewhat uncertain world. The only bad mix we have coming at us right now that I can tell you about is I know that Lal in the first half of this year, his most profitable business being instrumentation and flow, our -- without the return to KOB 3, he'll struggle, and that's a 60-plus percent GP margin business. So all these cost reductions are very helpful, but 60%-plus GP margin business when it has a struggling in the short term. But you're right. He's taken additional actions. I think that if we get any volume, our leverage, our upside is there, but I want to make sure that we laid out a foundation forecast for that little -- I have two dogs right now. Both of them can jump a little bit higher than Zorro can do because they're younger. They're only -- one's 2.5 and one's 1.5. So they can jump a little higher. They can jump higher than dad can jump now. So I think the key issue for us is the only headwind we see is the mix on KOB 3 North America. If we start seeing that turn around, especially around instrumentation and flow, Lal's business will do pretty well. As it is right now, he's targeting internally a 20% deleverage in 2021 as he's got this forecast. But the only thing we're watching very carefully and we'll be conservative about is to see North -- is this North America not turn around in KOB 3. If it doesn't, he's going to have a really tough -- I don't care what he does. That instrumentation and flow business will deleverage pretty hard because he's got it down to the bare minimums at this point in time. So that's the only thing we're really cautious about, Steve. So you're right. Charles Tusa : Yes. I guess what I kind of like -- maybe this is just too stupid of a way to look at it. But your sales are down. David Farr : I'd never call you stupid, Steve. I'd never call you stupid. Charles Tusa : Your underlying is down. You have your toughest comp in the first quarter, yet your adjusted EPS is going to be flat. And then you're calling for the year to be flat. So it just is kind of like if you're starting the first quarter at kind of flat EPS and that's your toughest revenue comp, it just -- I kind of like struggle with like why you're going to be flat for the rest of the year on an EPS basis. David Farr : I just want to make sure that we -- I'm not trying to be too crazy here. There's so much uncertainty around it in the timing, I think as Josh said earlier in talking about the signs. Our biggest uncertainty right now is the U.S.A. KOB 3, and I did not want to put a forecast out there that really gave us a lot of leverage around KOB 3 and the U.S.A. until we start seeing the whites of those eyes. And so that's why we're being a little bit cautious, Steve. I mean if you go... Charles Tusa : Okay. And then one... David Farr : Go ahead. Charles Tusa : And then -- sorry, one for Jamie. Congrats, first of all. Second of all, what will your -- why not more of a catch-up on resi, North American resi HVAC? I mean is that just all coming now? Is there a particular -- now that we've seen all the resi guys report, the numbers are obviously very strong. In fact, Carrier up ridiculously. Lennox, you may not serve as much, not up as much. Is there a particular customer out there that you guys serve that may have kind of missed out a bit on this season and is now kind of restocking for next? Like, it's just a little bit strange to me that you guys as a component supplier would be having this big channel fill in kind of the first quarter of this year as opposed to a catch-up in the third or maybe a catch-up in the second going into the third or next year or whatever it is, the next spring. Maybe you could just talk about kind of resi HVAC, what you saw there. James Froedge : Yes. Look, the A/C orders have been strong going back into June, especially July, August, September. So this isn't brand-new thing, okay? As you know, there's a timing differential between our order rates, our sales rates and when these guys -- our customers are reporting out, and they have a different mix than we do. Actually, Steve, it's quite the contrary to your question. We believe, based upon what our customers are sharing with us and what we've been asked to do to help the industry out, that we're doing very, very well during this recovery. Now there are uncertainties with everyone's operations. But overall, I think we've done a nice job, maybe better than the competitors on the operations side, and we're being asked to fill some holes. So if anything, it's kind of the opposite of what I think the question maybe implies. So we've seen strong orders now 3, 4 months. We see strong orders going into the next few months and sales following right along. And we've not lost track with any major customers. David Farr : I think it's just a function of trying to keep up with them right now. And we always will lag them a little bit. We'll always lag them a little bit, but I don't see -- our underlying growth rate is the same as their growth rates from the standpoint of components. We're not seeing any problems there. James Froedge : Yes. I mean you look at... Charles Tusa : And then, Dave, just one last quick one. Who did you mention? You mentioned some competitor that's exited the market. Is that -- was that on the HVAC side? Is that Bristol? Or are you talking about somebody on the -- what you said on the automation side, somebody exited or something like that, somebody is not there. Who was it? David Farr : ShopBack. ShopBack went bankrupt. And ShopBack is the #2 player. Charles Tusa : Oh, ShopBack. All right. I'll have to add that to my watch list. Okay. All right. Awesome. David Farr : Well, it's a private company, you can't add it to your watch list, let me say. It's private -- it's the major supplier in the industry, and they had half the industry. We had the other half. It's -- so it's going to come back, but I think that we have a window here to pick up some of that business over the next, I would say, the next 6 months before they get their act back together. They literally shut down their plants in Asia, Vietnam and United States right now, and they've been shutdown for probably 30 days. And so that's a unique opportunity for us right now. But you hit the nail in the head there, Steve. We're -- I want to be very careful with the uncertainty out there. And as we see things getting better, as Lal's business picks back up North America, we will leverage. That's the whole game here. That's what we want to play this year. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Andrew Obin : A question on oil and gas. So you did talk about structural change in oil and gas. But the question I have, as your customers sort of think about -- we've seen headlines, for example, Exxon is reducing CapEx to protect its dividend. So clearly, they're thinking about the world differently. What does it mean for what they're going to spend money on going forward? Does it change the mix dramatically? And in particular, does it change the conversation, you have this, if I have it right, top-quartile initiative? How did they change their thinking about efficiency? And as I said, just going back, what do they spend on going forward if there is no more growth long term? David Farr : I'll take a shot in. Lal's there, but I think the -- it is going to change the mix. It's going to change. You're not going to see a lot of new energy resources going to play. What they're going to figure out how to do is get more out of it, more efficiency, more productivity, safety and all those different things which will be good for us. It's a good thing, other than the fact that there won't be any new fields for many, many years for us to deal with from an installed base. So we'll be -- the KOB 3 will become more and more significant for us, and the upgrades they're going to have to spend around that to be from a productivity and quality and safety issue, which are all good things for us because that's not a jump ball type of big project. It's going to be -- you're going to be mining your installed base. And we have the strongest, the strongest by far of the global service support organization around the world for all the oil and gas industry. And as you know, we've made huge investments in that over the last couple of years, and that will really pay dividends for us as they start changing that mix. But that's why I think what's going to happen is we'll see that industry continue to shrink relative to investments. But our profitability should be pretty good once they start spending that money. So that's the way I see it. Lal, what are you hearing from your guys in the field right now? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. I think that's right, David. And just 3 things to add there, Andrew. The first is I still believe that we still are executing around the investments for the globalization of natural gas. Methane will continue to be a viable energy source in industry and in power generation combined cycle, and we're seeing those investments continue, be it on Exxon, Shell or anyone around the world. So that's important to note that it's not purely an oil and gas across the board. The second is the technology investments that drive reliability, safety, smart operations are still -- will continue to be very viable. A lot of those fall within our digital information business, and we continue to see those go forward. And then lastly, Andrew, we talked about a little bit earlier is the applicability of our technology for the decarbonization efforts and for the sustainability efforts that these customers are driving in a very broad set of applications, which we'll flush out in more detail for you in February and highlight. But that's an opportunity for us to change our mix within the customer spend. David Farr : Yes. So all the big oil and gas customers right now are engaging pretty heavy with Stuart Harris and Lal's business profile on digitalization and how they're going to try to reduce their carbon use. And that's where -- that's a benefit to us because it's a sensor business. It's more of a technology business and works. That's our strength. So as that shift happens, we'll still have pretty good sales, and we'll definitely have better profitability over the long term. So it is a shift that we're all going through, but I think it's going to benefit us as a company, given our presence and our digitalization position and everything we've been doing relative to that over the last 20 years. And I like the hand we have right now. Andrew Obin : Got you. And just a follow-up question on Commercial & Residential Solutions. Asia and Middle East & Africa down, just a little bit surprising given the pace of recovery in China. Is it China? Is it something else? And maybe more color on what's happening, specifically what are you seeing in China specifically? David Farr : Go ahead, Jamie. James Froedge : Well, look, October, there were some positive signs in Asia. But I think it's too soon to say that we've turned a corner. At this point, I still think it's a quarter, maybe 1.5 quarters away. But what you see there is we participate in industries like the hospitality as far as servicing hotels and restaurants and foodservice, food retail. And those industries are industries that are still pretty heavily impacted in China and across large parts of Asia. So although we've got some growth that's come back like our -- we serve some of the appliances in China out of our -- our Therm-O-Disc business has been very good. So there's pockets where we're strong. We've seen some good strength in the residential side. But the cold -- some of the cold chain and some -- especially around food service food retail, hospitality is still a tough, tough market. However, again, October results were promising. We had positive results in Asia and China. And so we'll see if that's sustainable or if it's just a blip on the radar here. But too early to tell, but some positive signs. David Farr : So Andrew, as you know, we -- our thrust in Asia and the Middle East was all around commercial, not residential. And so those markets have been hurt pretty hard relative to the end markets of this COVID situation. And we continue to develop the new products and new technologies around that. They'll come back. But until we start seeing movement of people, I think you're going to have a struggle there. And -- but I think it will start bouncing back as we go forward this year. Obviously, it's been down, tough for us so you get an easier comp. But more importantly to me is what I'm watching people spend the money on. Lal bounced back pretty nicely in China and Southeast Asia. Jamie ran that. He probably stuffed the channel before he came back and make a good year. But -- and so Susan Hughes, who follows him, will have a hard time with that, if she ever gets over there. Lal Karsanbhai : She got to work from it. David Farr : She got to work from it? That's fantastic. So I think I'm more optimistic about 2021 in Asia for Jamie than it was last year. I see signs picking back up. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, it should be a good year. I mean what we're outlooking for the full year is extraordinarily positive. It's just the growth really starts to accelerate kind of more in the second half. David Farr : But it's been disappointing. I would say the second half of '20 was disappointing for us. It didn't come back like it always do. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citibank -- or from Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : So you've talked about $650 million of annualized cost savings. It's a big program. I think it might be the biggest you've done in your tenure. So maybe you can just talk about -- put it in perspective for us. So you did talk about reaching your margin targets still that I think you set for FY '23, despite $2 billion less of sales. And I think you already answered Steve's question regarding conservatism around decrementals and incrementals. But if Lal's business does turn, does we get to see better than historical incrementals, especially if KOB 3 is coming back faster than KOB 1? David Farr : I'll answer that question right away. It's better or he won't be around, but I might step down. So that was an easy answer to that one. I mean to be honest, he wants it, too. I mean his organization to be -- they've gone through pain, step up, he's doing the first half. I mean he wants to get back to peak margins. He wants to do that. And his whole organization is very much focused on it, but at the same time, not cutting. So the answer is, yes, you'll get very good leverage as it comes back in the peak margin plan. We presented to the Board. We didn't -- we haven't talked to you this time, but we'll update you. I updated the planning conference group last week with our planning conference where we had 700 people, 600 of them are on the WebEx, and 100 in our conference room live face-to-face. And then -- but I think the key issue for the restructuring number, it is the largest number. Now the next largest would have been back, I would say, in the year that we broke the -- back in 2002, '03, '04, that time period there, '05, as we repositioned the whole company, as we globalized the company, that would be the next largest. And we had a very strong margin run-off of that if you go back, you look at those historical charts we put out there. But I think the most important thing we're doing here, we're also going back to the questions people have been asking. We're resetting the industries we're going after, where we're putting the resources, where we're putting our facilities, what type of plans we want to have. And from the perspective of what we're trying to get done with this repositioning, it's not all about margins. It's about how we reset the businesses for the next generation. And so a lot of that work that both Jamie and the Commercial & Residential side has been doing, the work that Lal has been doing, I said, okay, where does the business go? It's not where it's been, but where does it go? And so that's why what he's looking at, a lot of it's restructuring and the online type of technologies, the online customer base, that's moving. Where do I want that to be? And that's why it's such a massive number. I think that what we're trying to do is reset like we did back in 2002, '03 and '04 and then had a hell of a run all the way -- through all the way as we set those some peak margins. And I think that that's what these guys are trying to do right now. It's heavy lifting, but it's resetting the company structure for a different Emerson, for different industries, different customer base and different services as the company continues to transform. And that's not easy to do because you've got to go debate with everybody saying, \"Why are we doing it this way?\" And so I think that -- I think Lal and Jamie are set up when they finish this to be a good run. So I think... Lal Karsanbhai : Andrew, I think you know he said it well. We didn't want to waste the opportunity. And it's not purely about taking costs out. It's about thinking about how we can do business differently, the way we're resetting the platform and how we interface with our customers and how we interface internally as an organization through this process. And that's really what this is. A heavy element of that is also realigning our vast cost structure into Eastern Europe, Mexico and Asia, a very important part of this journey as well. So both components are very well thought out. Our entire plan runs across 17 different individual tracks of execution that we manage month to month and has been done very, very well with the leadership of Ram and others across the organization. David Farr : Yes. We're trying to totally reset Automation Solutions. I mean there's not as much of that with Jamie. There's a little bit of that, but it's been far more with Lal's business because we know Lal's business, as we've been talking about, there will be different customer base, different customer needs as he thinks forward 10, 15, 20 years from now. And that's what this is, a reset. James Froedge : Yes. On the commercial side, it's different SG&A profile. And so as Dave said, we did take out around 11% of SG&A head count over the last few years because the business wasn't growing in '19 either. And there'll be a little that comes back, but there's still a lot of work that we're doing that we're able to get done on the facility side. So our footprint, and to Lal's point, where the footprint is and how efficient that footprint is to serve our markets, how regionalized we are, we'll be able to do 6, 7 years' worth of work in 2 or 3 years. And so, like Lal said, we didn't want to waste the opportunity, and it's going to pay huge dividends for our business going forward. David Farr : And that's why I keep telling everyone out there thank you very much because that's not easy to do in the middle of a friggin' COVID recession pandemic. Andrew Kaplowitz : Very helpful. And then just talking about free cash flow, it probably doesn't get talked about enough, but I mean, obviously, strong conversion in Q4. Can you talk about how you're thinking about sort of the puts and takes of working capital as you go into '21? Obviously, you mentioned a little bit more CapEx. But again, good conversion going to continue. David Farr : Okay. So 2021 is going to be a fun one. We've set ourselves up for a very challenging 2021 because, obviously, we really performed well in the second half of the year in operating cash flow and free cash flow. We almost set a new record as free cash flow as a percent of sales at 15.1%. I think all-time record is probably around 15.5%, 15.6%. The big issue for us, Andrew, it's going to -- Andy, has got to be around we need earnings. We need earnings because what's going to happen as the year progresses, our balance sheet is -- other than a little bit of extra inventory that we brought in to make sure we protected our customers from a channel standpoint and a supply chain standpoint, we're in pretty good shape on the balance sheet. So what's going to happen is that balance sheet is actually going to get bigger from a working capital standpoint because we're going to be growing in the second half of the year. So the way for us to get back to the very challenging operating cash flow and free cash flow number next year, which will still be very, very good, is we've got to get higher earnings because as we -- as Frank and I have communicated to all the lead people out there, earnings is going to drive cash flow this year, not the liquidation of the balance sheet. In fact, the balance sheet is going to go the opposite way. So this is -- we thought last year was a lot of fun. This one's a higher degree of difficulty for the operating people because they're going to try to figure out how to not to put a lot of working capital on but they're going to have to put some on because our receivables are growing, our inventory will be growing a little bit but at the same time, how we get more earnings. So now if we want to keep a $3 billion or $3.1 billion in front of the operating earnings or cash flow next year, we've got to really work hard on the earnings side. It's not going to be on the working capital side. And that -- and everyone has been communicating. Frank's been beating everyone up on that one from the standpoint of CFO. We can see that, period. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Julian Mitchell : I'll keep it quite brief. Maybe just two quick ones. So one would be for Jamie, and welcome again to this forum. But what are your thoughts around the operating... David Farr : Forum? Julian Mitchell : Yes. I think a virtual forum, perhaps the -- how is the operating leverage in the business this year? You've got that mid-single-digit-plus sales growth. What kind of incremental margin should we expect? And any big variation through the year? And then the second question would just be for Lal around China. How did that business finish up fiscal '20 in Auto Sol? And what's the expectation for China in fiscal '21 in your business, please? David Farr : Okay, Jamie? James Froedge : Yes. I mean it will be somewhat just north of 30%. And exactly what number will be, it will depend a little bit around -- on the mix and all the other factors. But it will be in that range, and so we feel very positive about it. We've not lost any momentum on the cost actions that we're taking, and those are going to continue throughout the year. So we feel pretty good about that. I don't look at the year right now and say, well, this quarter, we're fine. This quarter, we're not. Price in the mine was very good for us. Last year, it's good for us in the first quarter. It gets a little tougher as the year develops, but we knew that. We've known that. And that's normal for our cycle, and so we've got plans around it. So I don't see anything extraordinary at this moment as the way of the cycle. We have profitable businesses growing right now. We have other profitable -- very profitable businesses at a similar profit profile that start to grow in the second half. So right now, that's the way the plan looks. Lal Karsanbhai : So yes, Julian. On China, the first -- obviously, we had a very significant downturn in the second quarter, fiscal quarter of the year. But the market recovered very aggressively in the second half. We ended up flat for the year in China destination sales for 2020. So it was a flat, but as Jamie will tell you, hasn't been there, it felt like a plus 10 or more because of the tremendous second half work and what our teams have to encounter on that $1 billion-plus business. Now looking at '21, I'll give you a range of plus 1 to plus 4, somewhere in there, is where I'm landing right now. I think there's some positives in chemical, life science, automotive, as I said earlier, and that's offset by some challenges around power generation and refining. So the plus 1, plus 4 is where we're working at right now. I think it will be low single digits. It may turn better as we go through the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : So I'll just keep it to one question since we're bumping up against some time here. But like just if I look at your portfolio, you guys referenced, especially within Automation Solutions, some good growth on the hybrid and discrete side. Just talk to us a little bit about how you feel about the portfolio there and whether you need to add on via M&A, just given some of the growth that you're seeing, especially, whether it's on medical or life sciences. Or do you have the right portfolio in place today to go after the opportunity? David Farr : From our perspective, as we went through Lal and his team this year from a strategy standpoint, we are acquirers in this space. We would like to add more, again, help us diversify into the hybrid space. We've been doing some software acquisitions, not many hardware at this point in time. We have the primary software. We would like to continue to acquire in the space to help us diversify and also drive a little bit faster growth. It's a tough market right now to do it, but we're outlooking pretty hard. And we're trying to shake it out. And I know Lal has his wish list, working with Mark Bulanda and the team there. So we are acquirer in this space right now, and we will continue to push that pretty hard from that perspective. I know Lal is very interested and has a very strong preference to that from that standpoint. So anything else you want to add? Lal Karsanbhai : No, you mentioned it earlier, David, I think that's well said, but there's also internal development ongoing in this space, including single-use devices for pharmaceutical bioproductions. So that's very relevant as well. So it's a combination, too, but absolutely acquisitive in that segment, and we'll continue to do that. David Farr : A lot of investment in that area right now, try to make that more relevant and more significant for all of us. So with that, I want to thank everybody for joining today. It was an amazing year. It's quite an unusual year as we wrap up 2021 -- our 2020 as move into '21. I want to again thank everybody out there for attending today and talking. I apologize, we lost our webcast -- WebEx, I guess, webcast for everybody. So the -- I guess... Pete Lilly : For a few minutes, but the recording will be available. David Farr : The recording will be available. Unfortunately, it tells you that Mr. Farr is stepping down or something like that. So you can't go back and change that. But I want to appreciate everybody for joining, and I want to thank everyone for this year. And we're looking forward to have a very good 2021 in an uncertain time, but we feel good about going into '21 based on what we got done in self-help in 2020. We got a strong team at the top here. We got Jamie here, Lal here, Frank and everybody else working around here. So we're looking forward to have a great year and making another record year for us in '21. So thank you, everybody, and look forward to seeing everybody soon. Operator : This conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Emerson First Quarter of 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Pete Lilly, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead. Pete Lilly : Good afternoon. Thank you so much, and welcome, everyone, to Emerson's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Today, I'm joined by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jamie Froedge, Executive President of Emerson Commercial & Residential Solutions; and congratulations to Lal Karsanbhai, current Executive President of Emerson Automation Solutions, who was recently announced as Emerson's next Chief Executive Officer effective on February 5. As usual, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Starting on Slide 3. I'd like to briefly highlight two examples of the great work our global teams are doing and some recent recognition from customers and the marketplace. First, Emerson's Plantweb Optics analytics software recently received the 2021 IoT Breakthrough Award. Emerson's Plantweb Optics platform helps customers collect OT data from a variety of sources and apply practical and customized visualization and analytics, delivering key operational insights to the right people at the right time.  Next, turning to Slide 4. Emerson recently received the 2021 Control Reader's Choice Award for our industry-leading automation control and instrumentation solutions. Emerson continues to receive positive feedback from customers and users of our products based on a relentless focus on technology, unmatched customer service and critical domain expertise in our customers' industries. Turning to Slide 5, we will review the highlights of a very strong quarter. First, Emerson remains steadfast in our commitment to health and safety for our employees, customers and communities. Serving our customers in critical industries, disciplined cost control and positioning to outperform as we emerge from COVID-19 remain our key thematic priorities, and we are starting to see the benefits of this focus flow through. Next, our regionalized operations remain sturdy and stable, and we will continue to build upon our firmly rooted strategy of business localization. Turning to performance. Emerson delivered a very strong quarter in a challenging but stabilizing and improving demand environment. The organization delivered adjusted EPS of $0.83 in the quarter, which was up 24% from the prior year and well above expectations. We continued our execution of the broad cost reset plan with an additional $69 million of new restructuring actions.  Cash flow was a new first quarter record for the company with operating cash flow of over $800 million and free cash flow of $686 million, up 90% and 121%, respectively. It is important to emphasize that the balance, the end market diversity and the stability of our two platform business strategy was critical to enabling the strong operational and cash flow outcome.  Even on down 2% organic revenue, segment margins grew by 230 basis points to 17.7%. This margin improvement is a strong testament to the consistent operational execution of the global organization throughout the pandemic.  Despite lingering uncertainty and demand challenges in many key markets, sales and orders finished ahead of previous guidance. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying orders remained quite strong, finishing up 15% on a trailing three-month basis. Importantly, our Automation Solutions business is showing signs of stabilization and improvement. Given the orders, sales and profitability improvement, we are updating full-year guidance to reflect the stronger outlook. Please turn to Slide 7, which offers details on the results of the quarter. Both underlying orders and sales came in ahead of expectations at down 4.5% and down 2%, respectively. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales was up 12%, while Automation Solutions was down 9%, but improving.  Adjusted EPS, which excludes restructuring and first year purchase accounting and fees, was up 28 -- 24% to $0.83, well ahead of expectations. As previously mentioned, the organization achieved a new Q1 cash flow record, driven by increased earnings and strong working capital management. Operating cash flow increased 90% to $808 million, and free cash flow increased 121% to $686 million.  Turning to Slide 8. We will briefly bridge adjusted EPS in the quarter. Starting with adjusted EPS in Q1 of 2020 of 68 -- $0.67, non-operating elements, including tax, interest, FX and other items, were a combined non-factor, adding $0.01 in total. The most important element was operations, which drove the vast majority of the EPS outperformance, contributing $0.13. Share repurchase added $0.02 for a total of $0.83 in the quarter. Moving to Slide 9, we will review the P&L. Net sales were flat, and we saw a slight reduction in GP margin, which was driven by volume deleverage and mix. Meanwhile, SG&A as a percentage of sales declined by 310 basis points to 24% as aggressive cost-control actions took effect.  EBIT and adjusted EBIT margins, which exclude restructuring and first-year purchase accounting and fees, increased 350 basis points and 260 basis points, respectively, also reflecting the cost-containment actions flowing through. Lastly, the effective tax rate came in at just below 20%, slightly lower than expectations.  Turning to Slide 10, we will review underlying sales by world area. For the quarter, the Americas continued to show the steepest declines, down 7%, but importantly, they started to improve. In North America, we saw strength in residential, cold chain, life sciences, medical, food and beverage and some discrete markets more than offset by weakness in many other automation end markets. Europe grew 4%; while Asia, Middle East and Africa grew by 3%, fueled by strength in China at 7%. All Commercial & Residential Solutions world areas turned to growth.  Please turn to Slide 11, and we will discuss the business segment performance. Total segment adjusted EBIT margin increased 230 basis points to 17.7%, reflecting aggressive cost-control measures and strong operational execution even with slightly down underlying sales. Adjusted pre-tax earnings increased by a similar magnitude, 240 basis points to 15.2%. As previously highlighted, Q1 cash flow performance was record-setting with operating cash flow and free cash flow increasing 90% and 121%, respectively. Free cash flow represented a 152% conversion of net earnings. Importantly, trade working capital dropped to 17.8% of sales driven by strong execution by operations.  Turning to Slide 13, we will discuss the business platforms. Automation Solutions underlying sales finished down 9% for the quarter. The Americas remained the most challenged, down 20%, but showed signs of stabilization and early improvement. Overall, we saw continued momentum in life sciences, food and beverage and semiconductor markets as well as some early signs of improvement in upstream energy markets. Meanwhile, Europe and Asia, Middle East and Africa both turned to low single-digit growth driven by strength in Eastern Europe and China, respectively.  Trailing 3-month underlying orders were down 13%, again reflecting stabilizing and early improvement trends. Geographically, the Americas continued to be the most challenged, down 27%. Asia, Middle East and Africa declined modestly by 1%, supported by China orders growing 6%. Europe declined by 3% due to weakness in energy markets, somewhat offset by chemical, power and life science projects.  Restructuring actions totaled $64 million across the platform as we continued execution of the return to peak profitability. The platform delivered robust positive profitability improvement despite the drop in revenue.  Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA margins increased 200 basis points and 290 basis points, respectively, as the effects of the ongoing cost actions took hold. Lastly, the platform increased backlog by $600 million, of which $300 million was due to the acquisition of OSI. The ending balance was $5.3 billion.  Turning to Slide 14. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales were up 12% in the quarter. All core world areas were solidly positive, with the Americas showing the strongest growth at 14% driven by strong residential, cold chain and home products demand. This growth points to share penetration gains in many of our end markets. Europe was up 8% as heat pump demand was driven by sustainability regulations and customer technology preferences. Finally, Asia, Middle East and Africa was up 7% driven by China, up 10%.  As mentioned, trailing 3-month underlying orders remained robust, up 15%, with all business units growing. North America increased by 16% in robust HVAC and home products demand, while China was up 17%. Restructuring actions totaled $3 million in the platform and were primarily focused on facility rationalization and optimization programs. Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA margins were up 230 basis points and up 210 basis points, respectively, reflecting leverage on the increased volume and improved cost base. Finally, backlog in the business increased by approximately $200 million, ending the quarter at nearly $800 million, which is well above normal levels.  Please turn to Slide 16, and we will introduce second quarter guidance. We now expect the underlying sales will be roughly flat year-over-year with a range of down 1% to up 1%. This potential for the company to return to positive growth is earlier than previously forecasted. The top line outlook is driven by continued momentum in residential, life science, medical, discrete and food and beverage markets and ongoing stabilization and improvement in other automation markets.  GAAP EPS and adjusted EPS are expected to be $0.83 and $0.89, respectively, plus or minus $0.02. We expect adjusted EBIT margin to be 17.0% to 17.5% with adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 22.2% to 22.8%. Lastly, it is important to note that this guidance embeds an $0.11 change in stock price costs due to movement in the stock price.  Slide 17 introduces our updated full-year 2021 guidance framework. Management assumes that demand will continue to be challenging but stabilizing and steadily improving as global vaccine efforts mature. We also assume there are no major operational or supply chain disruptions and that oil prices remain in the $45 to $55 range.  Given that context, we expect underlying sales growth this year with a range of flat to plus 4%. Automation Solutions is expected to be in the range of down 3% to up 1% underlying sales, while Commercial & Residential Solutions is expected to grow between 8% and 10%. As you can see, both of these platforms -- platform outlooks are improvements from November. We expect a slight decrease in effective tax rate as well as increases in operating cash flow and free cash flow to $3.15 billion and $2.55 billion, respectively. There is no other change to the capital allocation outlook.  GAAP EPS is expected to be $3.39, plus or minus $0.10; while adjusted EPS is expected to be $3.70, plus or minus $0.10. We have also updated our outlook for profitability headwinds and tailwinds in the year. Since last quarter, we expect that COVID-related savings will now only be down $40 million this year, up from the previous estimate of $70 million. However, we now expect that price cost dynamics will be slightly negative as raw material costs and availability become more of a short-term challenge. Operations are working diligently to mitigate this issue. Lastly, stock price will be more of a headwind.  And now please turn to Slide 18, and we will briefly cover the changes to the reset restructuring and COVID-related savings plan. Total company planned restructuring spend remains $200 million for the full fiscal year. As mentioned, we now expect only $40 million of the $150 million COVID-related savings from 2020 to return as business conditions start to normalize in the back half of the year. Accordingly, incremental 2021 savings have improved to $220 million. Total long-term annualized savings of the overall reset restructuring program are expected to exceed $650 million.  Please turn to Slide 20, and I will now hand the call over to Mr. David Farr. David Farr : Thank you, Pete. First, I want to welcome everyone to the first quarter earnings call. And I want to thank you very much for the interest in this great company. I'm clearly a little bit biased on that, but it is a great company. Second, I want to thank the global leadership team, the executive leadership team and all the employees around the world executing and delivering a fantastic first quarter for all of our investors. The last 19 months have been hard with a cost reset for peak margins, downturn in late 2019, COVID-19 pandemic and a resulting global recession and now the return to growth. My recognition and applauding to all of you is powerful and thankful. I want to thank all of you from my heart for what you've done over the last 19 months. But now we have a new threshold of execution for the second quarter and total fiscal year. I believe this team will make it happen. They are good.  Third, I want to recognize and congratulate Lal Karsanbhai as the new CEO of Emerson. I'm so proud of you and so excited for you and how you and your new OCE team will take Emerson to new heights as I and we have done the last 20 years. When Chuck Knight turned over the reins to me in late 2020, I took a deep breath, I paused, I smiled, and then I moved forward. You're ready and have what it takes to lead Emerson. You have the right stuff as does all the OCE and global leaders. I'll be your best cheerleader, your supporter, and my phone line is always open to you and your team. Pause for a second. Phew. Now why now? I'm healthy, folks. I'm not sick. Nothing is wrong with me other than my right knee, which is definitely gone, no golf. So the knee replacement is on the way. I've already talked to my doctor. The Board's succession plan and process ran its course with many great candidates over the last 5 years. I want to thank all of them. They all know who they are. A couple could be in this room.  I also want to thank Bob Sharp, who is a close friend and really wanted to be CEO of Emerson, but as he and I talked, told him was not going to happen. So we decided to figure out how to make it happen somewhere else. I wish him the best of luck.  As we went through the first quarter, it was clear to me, the Board that we clearly had one strong obvious candidate : Lal. The others are great leaders. They're great individuals. They're great friends. They've done great things in Emerson, but Lal is the next leader. So we decided.  But that's not the only issue. There are other things going on across the company. The company is in great shape, the P&L, the balance sheet and the cash flow. As the Finance Committee told Lal this morning, don't blank it up. We had a very good final quarter in fiscal 2020, as you all know. Orders have been turning up strongly. The V-shape recovery has been taking hold and is really firm at this point in time.  We've had strong exceptional execution around the massive cost reset that we embarked upon back in 2019, a cost reset costing us over $600 million when it's all said and done. The progress is enormous. You've seen it in the margins in the fourth fiscal quarter. You see it in the margins in the first quarter. We're going to deliver over $650 million of savings for the company when it's all said and done.  The global teams led by these 2 individuals -- these 3 individuals in this room, Lal, Jamie and Frank, are getting the job done. They don't need my help. We are going to continue to deliver. I guarantee you. That's one commitment that I made to the Board when I said, yes, Lal is the guy.  The first quarter was strong on all fronts. GAAP sales were flat; underlying sales, only down 2%. And I believe in the second quarter, our GAAP sales will clearly be up, and I think our underlying sales will be up also, maybe not a lot, but I think it will be positive.  Profitability was very good and with improving volume and cost out in the first quarter, great incremental margins on both sides. Strong margins, EPS momentum and, yes, record first quarter cash flow of $800 million and free cash flow of $700 million, extremely strong execution around earnings and the balance sheet.  And we see a solid fiscal quarter, both -- in both platforms across fiscal '21. Sales will grow this year, both in GAAP and underlying growth standpoint. We'll have increased margins, stronger EPS, potentially even that $3.70, which was our 2019 EPS with much higher sales in 2019. Plus strong cash flow. In my opinion, the number will bust the $3.2 billion, but I'm not the CEO, so he has to live with that number. With order and sales momentum in the second half of 2021 and going into 2022, we, the OCE, believe we'll finally deliver the $4-plus EPS in '22. Based on the global economic recovery, the momentum we see and the cost out, it looks very good, and we'll talk about that on the 16th. Cost reset, the drive to new peak margins in '22, '23, they are firmly in place. The entire next-generation team is ready to take the reins and lead Emerson forward.  Clearly, even with the COVID-19 vaccine rolling out, we continue to be restrictive on what we can do. We have to operate in a safe environment. The normal year Emerson management process is somewhat turned, not quite the same. Global travel; live customer engagement; our face-to-face planning conference, which is known to be a combat sport at times; organization planning process; leadership planning process are all restricted and delayed. We're doing them, but they're not the same.  So as I thought about what I can do as the CEO in this environment, it's basically take my experience, my maturity, which many of you know I'm mature, in this environment and help the next team. Name the new team, put it in place, get out of their way and help. That's what I'm going to do. I talked to the Board about this. It makes the most sense.  Yes, I said 2021. Yes, I even said maybe most likely later in 2021. But the new facts and issues, and I always like to surprise, with our annual investor conference coming up this month in the 20 -- 16th, I think the time is ripe for the new CEO to stand up, present and not have the Dave Farr game, which many of you've had for over 20 years, in some cases, more than that as I worked for Mr. Knight.  The February 16 time -- the February 16 presentation with the next-generation team is very important. I'll be there to help. I'll be there to advise. I care about this company. I'm a big shareholder in this company. It's been my life for 40 years, leading it for over 20 years. The time is ripe.  As you know, I've never believed in long, drawn-out successions. Chuck and I had 3 days. He hit me with the keys in the chest. He took off for a year or for 6 months. I had to track him down to try to break the quarter string on earnings. The team, the -- Lal are ready. So let's move on. As I talked to the Board, we all said the same thing. So again, my congrats to Lal and the OCE. And if anyone wants to start a yelling match with me, you'll quickly see I'm not sick.  Let's go to Chart 20. I do have my Stan Musial bat, my Rally Monkey and my rally squirrel, which is really a rally ferret, sitting here today, helping us out, making sure I don't lose my train of thought. We have pretty good momentum in orders. We laid out boxes. We started this box game as we put our forecast out in, I think, April of 2020 with Frank, at that time, Bob and myself. We delivered -- actually -- we laid out the box in the first quarter. You can see we came in better. The blue dot is where we thought we would be. We're above that, obviously, at the upper right-hand corner.  Jamie's business has been very strong. He's executing. He's building backlog. That's one of his issues. He's got to get that backlog down. Lal's business has turned. It's not going to be quite as sharp as Jamie. Clearly, it's a different business model. But he's turned.  If you look at the next forecast, next quarter, we now have a blue dot sitting pretty much on orders above the line, with a minus 4% to plus 6%. We're seeing good momentum in Europe. We're seeing good momentum in Asia. We see good momentum in Jamie's business in North America, and we're seeing some improvement in Lal's business, which I'm sure he'll talk about. So again, very good momentum in orders. As we lay this out, that's how we see it.  Jamie's business will flatten out. It will turn down a bit. He's running at high levels at this point in time, clearly some unique opportunity of growth there with all his markets as he'll tell you going the right way, which is great to see. So if you look at Slide 21, what we're looking at right now for the growth this year, as we presented the Board, we're looking at somewhere around the plus 1, minus 1 for the second quarter, depends on what kind of execution Jamie can get on his -- on the backlog. He clearly has issues relative to capacity, COVID, materials, which we'll talk about.  I think Lal's short-term business is starting to turn up, and we'll talk about that in his discrete business. Even some of the onesie, twosie orders are starting to happen. We have a broad second half. It's hard -- the third quarter will be a spike. As we all know, it's a spike down. But the key issue for us is to look at good growth in second half. Obviously, the ratios will look really good in the third quarter. But we're looking at the second half and the overall business pace in that second half going into fiscal '22.  What I want to do is turn it over to Lal now so he can talk a little bit about his forecast and what he sees, some insights into the marketplace, and then we'll turn it over to Jamie and let him do the same thing. So Lal, the floor is yours. Surendralal Karsanbhai : Thanks, David. Sorry. It's been an emotional time for a lot of us, Dave, and your words are very special. I'm very proud of the team and what the team has accomplished in the quarter. It's a phenomenal execution of a plan that we laid out for our investors last February that we committed to do, and we're now seeing it reflected in the P&L of the company. We're generating some of our own tailwinds, which I'll talk to you about, and the market is starting to recover broadly across many geographies as well, which is highly encouraging.  This Page 22, nothing really changed appreciably in our orders as we went through the summer months. However, as we got into the late fall, we started to see an increase in activity, particularly driven by Europe and Asia.  I'll flip to the next chart and give you some perspectives on how we see the outlook right now. The industries that drove growth dramatically were the discrete industries driven by Germany, specifically, which had turned its economic engine on and started to accelerate both in the process space for internal consumption and then its vast export market engine. So we started to see that improve in automotive and semiconductor packaging OEMs as well as broad activity across Europe around power and the specialty chemicals segment.  In Asia, driven by China, Steve highlighted growth of 6%. We feel very good about what we've seen there and expect that growth to accelerate into Q2 as we'll talk about in a moment. But the big elephant in the room is North America. And what we experienced in North America was a stabilization of the oil and gas markets, albeit at lower levels but a forecastable level of business. What the business -- what has driven the business in -- on the continent has been power generation, mining in the Southern Cone and life sciences throughout, which has been a great story for us. As a result of that, we are seeing a recovery and expect to see sequential improvement in order pacing and sales pacing in the second quarter and in the second half of the year as indicated back on Chart 22. Let me turn then to Chart 24, and we'll give a perspective of how we see the world areas first half to second half. And across most of the world, and I can pick out 1 or 2 pockets here, we will see that improvement reflected in the environment. That discrete energy -- that discrete momentum that we've built in Europe and Asia will begin in the Americas, in North America, particularly. And we've seen, as David noted, early signs of distribution-based business recovery as we navigated through December into January. So that's very encouraging to see. I was in Odessa, Texas a few weeks ago. I saw -- I met with teams and talked about the plans for 3.8 million barrels a day production for the year, which is a stable level from where it was a year ago. So we'll see maintenance of that, increased drilling to maintain those levels in those fields. So some encouragement there. But obviously, demand will ultimately drive those -- that market. In Europe, I've talked about it's really been a German story. Our discrete business is up over 30%. Our process business is up over 10% in Germany alone. And that -- and then there's increased momentum throughout the continent, very pleased with the positive first quarter, and we expect that to continue.  And in Asia, the China bounce back was important. That was discrete-driven and process-driven as well. And we feel very good about the funnel of activity that we see as we look out right now. So I feel much better than I did in October, David and team. But -- and I look forward to a much better outlook in executing in a much better environment as we go forward. David Farr : You did feel better once you got the CEO ring. Surendralal Karsanbhai : Well, I feel even better because I've got Jamie. Jamie's rolling. David Farr : Yes. Well, I just set you up for a very tough second quarter. So now I think -- so I mean very interesting to see. It's too early to talk about January, but you see the analyzing around January because I think we are feeling the distribution. We are feeling some semblance of optimism in even the Americas, and you've obviously seen some very good international orders. So I think that things are setting up. It doesn't mean it's going to be a perfect straight up. You're going to be going here or there. You go sideways stepping. But I feel very good about it.  Jamie, I mean, you have a -- like you said, you're -- you can't be the slowest antelope in the pack when the tiger's out there. Right now, you're not the slowest antelope, but you've got a tiger out there running around. So what do you see happening to your business in the second half? James Froedge : Yes. The tiger is some kind of combination between growth that folks have never seen before and kind of a material situation that we're all dealing with around the world. David Farr : And customers. James Froedge : Before I jump into that, I just want to I say a couple of words because this is a one -- a special moment in time here. It's not going to come again. I want to say thank you and congratulations to David on just really an unprecedented career. What you've done in the space, there's no comparison to it. I know there's thousands of families and employees around the world that you've touched that wish they could be here to say this. I'll speak for them as well to say thank you for all you've done. You're part of the fabric of this company forever. And you've been a great leader and mentor for me, but you've also been -- you are a great friend. So congratulations. David Farr : Thank you. James Froedge : Lal, I want to say congratulations to you. We've known each other pretty much since I joined the company. We were in a similar leadership class together and worked at corporate together. We worked in the business together. I worked for you in automation. Now as business as leaders now, I get to see you in the CEO role, and I'm very proud of you. I know that the leadership team has a great deal of confidence in you, and we're very excited about this next chapter together. So congratulations to you and your wonderful family, who I have gotten to know over the years. So congratulations. Surendralal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Jamie. James Froedge : So with that said, let's jump into the first chart there, Chart 25, that shows the updated outlook for underlying sales for the year. As you can see, you heard throughout the call, the outlook for the year has improved since we last spoke. In November, we were outlooking 4% to 7% underlying growth for the year. It was going to be about 5% to 6% in Q1, 2% to 4% in Q2 and 5% to 8% in the second half. And growth in orders and sales has really accelerated in Q1, as Dave talked about, and we saw greater-than-expected strength in North America residential markets along with accelerated improvement really in all other businesses and world areas.  And so from a Q1 order standpoint, we saw double-digit trailing 3-month underlying orders for all of our businesses with the exception of Professional Tools, which came in at 2% after delivering 8% orders growth in the month of December. So it was improving as the quarter went on. The broad product line and world area strength that we saw in Q1 orders, the backlog we built, what we continue to see in our business trends in January support the increase in our outlook for the remainder of the year. So if you go to the next chart, Chart 26. These 2 -- these next 2 charts look at the business from a product line and then a geographic perspective. First, from a product perspective, we see underlying sales growth in the heating and AC business in the 9% to 12% range for the year. Extremely strong first half driven by the residential market and a more moderate second half as, by the fourth quarter, inventory restocking should stabilize. Demand may settle into a pattern closer to historic cycles. However, we do see positive medium- and long-term trends in the residential market driven by homeownership, remodeling and a focus on efficiency and environmental concerns.  Our Cold Chain business has exhibited a quicker growth recovery than anticipated. In November, we expected Cold Chain to grow more in the 3% to 6% range for the year, now at 6% to 9%, supported by a stronger Q1 than expected, which was really driven by a 20-plus percent Q1 sales in global transport, positive growth in U.S. foodservice in December. So even though foodservice is a tough market, coming back slower, we had positive growth in December, double-digit growth in U.S. food retail in the second half of the quarter and double-digit aftermarket growth.  China delivered double-digit Q1 Cold Chain sales growth with transport up more than 40%. We anticipate solid, stable growth in the Cold Chain as the year evolved. Foodservice will continue to lag other segments, but improvement in vaccine rollout could drive upside in that space in the back half of the year.  In November, our outlook for Tools & Home products was also in the 3% to 6% range. It's now 6% to 9%. Our home products business and tools we have impacted by residential demand, we will see extremely strong growth in the first half.  Just to put some of the home and contractor growth in perspective. In Q1, our wet/dry vac business posted 38% trailing 3-month fixed rate orders, and our InSinkErator business saw 20% plus trailing 3-month fixed rate orders growth. Again, the residential markets will settle into more moderate growth rates as the year progresses with very strong growth in the first half, good overall fundamentals in the medium and long term. For the remainder of our Professional Tools products, we will see a return to quarterly sales growth in Q2, followed by double-digit growth in the second half of the year, aided by comparables in Q3 but also a general improvement in market conditions globally, which we already started to see, as David mentioned. For example, EMEA, Asia both turned positive in Q1, and general industrial has been steadily improving. Overall, commercial building construction globally will continue to lag the recovery of most of our other served markets.  All right. Next chart, Chart 27. Our heating and AC compression business saw 24% plus trailing 3-month Q1 orders growth with exponentially higher growth in residential. Our Q1 U.S. residential heating and AC compression businesses sales grew 69% in the quarter with growth accelerating as the quarter unfolded.  We do expect the U.S. residential market to settle into lower growth in the second half for the first half as we've seen unique near-term growth dynamics and the rebuild of inventory in the channel. However, as I mentioned earlier, we do see some longer-term positive residential trends persisting.  North America industrial continues to improve with commercial building construction lagging. Asia climate trailing 3-month fixed rate orders due to December were up 11%. Europe climate was up 12%, supported by continued strength in the heat pump space in Europe along with weather conditions improving marketing conditions overall in China. Overall, Europe Q1 climate fixed sales growth was 8% with heating growth up 40%. Overall, Asia fixed rate climate sales were up a little more than 6%. The climate part was up 15%, and the heating piece inside of that was up 30%. So we see pretty solid growth dynamics for the remainder of the year in North America, Europe, China and the Middle East and several smaller markets but a slower recovery in parts of North and Southeast Asia.  The COVID situation is dynamic. We're watching it closely around the world. We'll let you know if we start to see any changes that would reflect our current view of how the year is going to unfold.  And just to wrap up, I want to say thank you to the entire Commercial & Residential Solutions team, the whole Emerson team for a tremendous quarter. You all responded to unprecedented demand increases, worked long hours to make sure we meet our customer needs while working hard to keep our employees safe. And we saw historic increases in demand in several businesses. Our team did a great job responding. And what we all can't forget is the middle of a pandemic. And so I want you to know how much the entire leadership team appreciates all of your efforts.  So with that, I'll pass it back to Dave. Onto you, Dave. David Farr : Thank you very much, Jamie. Key issue here is Lal needs you to come through again in the second quarter, you and your team. I know you've got a lot of issues with, obviously, keeping the plants up and running.  As we told the Board yesterday and again today, we are making investments for capacity, for productivity for you. Lal's clearly got plenty of capacity, but he's moving new facilities out, so he'll have capacity when it comes to '22, '23. So you really have a lot of moving parts. I think your team is in really great shape. And I know the team here at corporate will try to support you they best can as you go through this process because we're banking on your strong execution to deliver this year. James Froedge : Yes. David Farr : For the people on phone, I've been very busy in the last 2 days if you can imagine, Board meetings, shareholder meeting. I received over 500 e-mails and faxes. I will get back to everybody. It takes time. I'm not ignoring you. I didn't change my e-mail address, and I didn't block all the crazy ones out there that people sent me e-mails, too. It's wide open. And I will have a webcast tomorrow in the morning with Lal, and then I'll start the process and work my way up.  You all mean a lot to me. You're my friend. We debate. We don't always agree, but you're all my friends, and I will get back to every single person that has sent me e-mails and faxes over the last 2 days. I appreciate that.  With that, we're going to open the floor for Q&A. I, again, look forward to listening to this Webex -- or the webcast the next time. I guess that will be May. And so you guys are going to have fun. But today, we have a little fun one more time. So open the floor up. Well, who's going to hit me first? Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good afternoon, guys. David Farr : Good afternoon, Andy. Surendralal Karsanbhai : Good afternoon. Andrew Kaplowitz : Dave, I know I speak for all of us : you've been a great help to the entire investment community. You keep it real. You keep it light at the same time, which we appreciate. Congrats, Lal. I think you're going to need some sort of rally animal to fill those shoes of Dave. David Farr : He isn't taking my Rally Monkey or my rally ferret. That sucker is -- those are going home with me. Andrew Kaplowitz : So, Dave, maybe the first question is -- one of the things you've talked about in the past is that you're hopeful that CEOs would begin to spend on CapEx again as the new year unfolds and that same distribution begins to ramp up. So your orders suggest maybe that you're seeing a little bit of that in Automation Solutions, but maybe you could step back and tell us if your conversations with customers are changing yet to the point where they're starting to open up their CapEx spigots? David Farr : So I wouldn't use the word spigot, but I would use -- I think that the conversation is with CEOs, my fellow CEOs, is that, in the capital industrial world, they are opening up. And they're talking about spending money around bringing lines back up, Andy, being -- getting some incremental capacity. We have a situation right now in the supply chain for Jamie's side of the business. There's a huge capacity issue, where there's not enough capacity, and we know they're going to have to -- they're going to start spending money around steel, iron ore, mining, copper, plastics, all these things.  So what Lal's guys are hearing and we've been hearing quite a bit across the United States even now and even in Europe, they are starting to talk about small projects and spending. So I think those conversations will continue. I think you'll start seeing capital. We're going to spend more capital this year. I bet you, if we had the time, we'd probably even spend more, but the time is not a big issue for us. So I think that we're feeling it, and we're -- Lal's seeing it. Where I really, really, really want to see it is the U.S.A. And -- but I guarantee you Jamie's customers, his facilities, all need capital, and Lal's the one who is going to make it for him. So that's what we see. But we'll see how that unfolds this year.  I think our discrete business in the U.S. probably had a good month. We don't know yet totally, but I think they had a very good month. And that will tell me that the projects are coming at the distributors of the channel. They're talking. They're ordering product. I think that Professional Tools will be the same way. If I -- now I turn to Jamie. He's shaking his head. James Froedge : Yes. David Farr : So that means the channel is coming, Andy. So I think that I feel good about it. Now the question is the momentum, but we'll see how much. But they've got to spend some money here. They've got to get things going, productivity-wise. And so I feel good about it right now. Andrew Kaplowitz : That's good to hear, Dave. And then at the risk of front-running your Analyst Day a little bit, when you think about Automation Solutions coming out of the downturn and the margin progression, when we look at Q1, you obviously improved adjusted EBIT by 200 basis points despite the decline in revenue. So as the segment improves, should you be capable of delivering over that mid-30% incrementals you've talked about in the past given your restructuring efforts? And do you see a path back to the high teens adjusted margin here over the next couple of years? David Farr : I'll let Lal answer that. I have my opinion, but I'll let him answer it first because he's the one who's got to deliver. So\u2026 Surendralal Karsanbhai : Absolutely. We're well on path, Andy, to deliver that peak margin plan in 2023. We want to stay that course. If we do get that tailwind, we have investments that we will need to make in this business. This is a technology business that's built around phenomenal products that differentiate us in the marketplace and allow those participation gains that we always have enjoyed and benefited from. So we will invest back in the business, and we'll stay measured. But I think we have opportunities, obviously, and we are in a phenomenal momentum right now in terms of margin execution. David Farr : So if you think about the next two or three quarters, the way Lal's business will unfold, he's going to have his earlier-cycle businesses. Those are all his higher-margin business. And so if you think about D&I, you think about measurement and instrumentation, you think about those businesses as flow businesses. Those are better-margin business. That's what's going to come back for him first. So he should have pretty good incrementals.  He doesn't have the same cost/price pressure. He has a little bit of it, but not as much as Jamie does. And I don't see a lot of KOB1-type projects coming in for, what, 12, 18 months, Lal. Surendralal Karsanbhai : That's right. David Farr : So I think that as he goes into 2022, my gut tells me he's going to have strong double-digit orders going into 2022 in the fourth quarter. The question will be is the execution of the plans ready, has he got the moves done. And I think he's set up for a very good first-half of 2022 margin flow-through. Not every quarter is going to be perfect like this one. But I think, overall, his team is really focused on this. And I think they got -- they're ready to have a good execution around margin, and they will reach those new peak margins. Andrew Kaplowitz : Congrats again, guys. Good luck, Dave. David Farr : Andy, thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joseph Ritchie : Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. David Farr : Good afternoon, Joe. Joseph Ritchie : Dave, you're going to be missed. I hope you get that knee fixed soon. Go hit the links. Enjoy retirement. But yes, thanks for everything throughout the years. David Farr : My neighbor does not sound too excited about me retiring. He called me a walking dude and [indiscernible] earlier when he came up in his truck, he said, what are you guys doing in the neighborhood? I said, I\u2019m not going to knocking at doors and asking to help you do things like fix the air conditioning, the concrete work, so a lot of my neighborhood just think about, I need to move. Okay, Joe, let\u2019s get back to you. Joseph Ritchie : All right. Well, Lal, congratulations as well. Surendralal Karsanbhai : Thank you. Joseph Ritchie : And I look forward to working with you closer. But yes, maybe my first question, Lal. I know you're going to tell us more at the Investor Day in a couple of weeks. But maybe talk to us a little bit about how you're thinking about looking at things maybe with -- from like a clean slate. And maybe that's the portfolio, maybe that's the margin trajectory, maybe that's the cost structure. Just any initial thoughts that you have on the transition and then making your imprint on the organization? Surendralal Karsanbhai : I surely appreciate the question, and I was waiting to hear who is the first one to ask. So congrats on that. There are a lot of things that I've thought about that I need to internalize and discuss with the team. Allow me a little bit of time. I'd like to really focus today on what's been just a phenomenal quarter for us for our organization and the guidance that we've put out for the year.  The 16th of February will be shortly upon us. You'll hear our voices. You'll hear some of our thoughts. And if you allow me that, I truly appreciate it. Joseph Ritchie : Okay. Fair enough. Maybe turning it over to Jamie for a second. Jamie, when you take a look at that Slide 25 and you take a look at like the growth outlook for the second half and compare it to what we saw in 2020, clearly, like you have your easiest comp in the third quarter. James Froedge : Yes. Joseph Ritchie : And I recognize that things have been kind of like white hot for you guys in the first half of this fiscal year. But how do I reconcile those two things in that growth is going to step down in the second half just given what seems like a really easy comp in Q3? James Froedge : Yes, we'll see. I mean, I think Q4 is a big question mark right now in the model. And what we -- one scenario is that a dramatic portion of pent-up demand plus inventory that had to be restocked got pulled into the first two quarters and possibly a little bit of the third quarter. And so by the time you get to the fourth, which -- you got a tougher comp. We started to see growth come back towards the end of last fourth quarter. So it's a different comp you're chasing and could the residential markets go flat, even slightly down, slightly positive in that range. So you're -- I think it -- we see the Professional Tools businesses doing very well in the second half, both in terms of comps but also just demand improvement. Cold Chain is going to be steady throughout the year. So it's really a residential story. If residential has another wave here and stays strong and you have a hot summer, you have a very strong buying market in the housing market -- I think there's a lot of folks that didn't participate in the last wave of this housing remodeling and purchasing. That may be on the sidelines ready to go. They could -- then it could extend. We could have upside. But it's too early to tell. And so -- but that's going to be the key thing. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Charles Tusa : Congrats to you both. Dave, thanks for all the really fun times over the last, I don't know, 15 years or so. It's been a lot of fun. David Farr : Thank you very much, Steve. Hopefully, we'll see each other at least one more time. Charles Tusa : Maybe. I'm definitely hoping for that. But onto the results, which were pretty good. The second quarter guidance, I think, for AS reported revenue looks like flat sequentially. Do I kind of have that right? And can you kind of explain why that would be? I mean, looking back other than in 2020, it seems like that business is always kind of up sequentially, comfortably. And then I have just a quick follow-up on the margins. David Farr : Okay. I would say, initial look at it, you're right. It's probably flat because of FX, foreign exchange, the delta there. And the question is also just a mix of business as Lal gets the -- does he get the U.S. business coming in. Until we see the -- really, as we know that the U.S. business is -- we're trying to be cautious on Lal's business. He's done well the last two quarters, beat the numbers, Steve.  But right now, it's just a function of we've got to get some of that early-turn cycle business. And so if he did see that happening in January, he should be able to do well in that second quarter. So probably a little cautious more than anything else and the currency impact from that perspective, Steve. But you're right in your analysis as always. And we'll see. Hopefully, it has a better quarter. Surendralal Karsanbhai : Yes. We're watching -- sorry, Steve. Charles Tusa : Go ahead, sorry. Surendralal Karsanbhai : Yes, just very quickly. We're watching our later-cycle businesses very carefully. Those will lag Final Control, which as they are the project-based businesses, which had good and lag coming into the down cycle. So Ram was still experiencing solid growth at this point last year and having weakened. And so we'll see him come in a little bit later. So that's going against us as well. Charles Tusa : And how much revenue will OSI contribute this year? Surendralal Karsanbhai : The Board plan, I can tell you what that is. It's around $180 million in sales. David Farr : Hopefully, it gets to $200 million. Surendralal Karsanbhai : We have a real shot. David Farr : I mean we had a good strong quarter, the first quarter, Steve. The question then, can we keep this momentum going there? They're really taking hold right now with our channel. And obviously, this whole renewable push is helping these guys a lot, too. But it's a question of how much they can execute around the various customers. But the orders right now are easily hitting the $200 million run rate. So... Surendralal Karsanbhai : Yes. So we booked nearly $95 million in the first quarter. David Farr : Yes. Charles Tusa : Right. And then one last one for you. I mean, I guess, despite kind of this quarter, which was well above prior year margins on a decline, you're basically guiding, I think, to flat adjusted segment margins year-over-year for 2Q. I mean, is there any reason? Is there a mix dynamic there? Is there something going on that we have to -- is it price cost? Like, what's the driver of a kind of a flattish margin year-over-year? David Farr : Yes. I think that -- did we give the individual margins up for the guys? No. So Steve, what you're seeing is Lal's business will have good second quarter margins. The big issue that Jamie has now got to override is the price cost as material inflation is coming in. Yes, he's got leverage from volume. He's got leverage from the reset. But the material cost numbers are starting to hit him right between the eyes at this point in time. We had good coverage in the first quarter. And now his team is working, scrambling hard to figure out how to offset that. So if we get good news there, then he'll be better than the margins in the second quarter, but he's the one that's going to be struggling when it comes to margins because of the material costs. And Lal -- I think Lal will have a good second quarter. I don't see -- or the automation business will have a good second quarter. Charles Tusa : And then one last one for you, Dave. I know you had kind of a tough ride in your first year as CEO. You had to kind of like break the streak and cut guidance. I mean, do you have enough visibility to kind of make us feel comfortable that we're not going to be kind of sitting here in the same shoes 6 months from now? David Farr : Yes. I mean the other problem is the GameStop thing that's going on out there. We did have the dot-com. The dot-com bust came in March for me that year. We would have had problems with the 9/11 issue too that year. So we -- yes, I did break the string. I did go see Chuck and said, Chuck, we're about to break the 44 year -- quarters. I knew I was going to have to do it eventually but not my second quarter in.  You're right, Steve. I think we have a better feel for what's going on right now, and I don't see a dot-com bust. So I feel comfortable. I don't think that we're -- I'm not setting Lal all up for that famous phone call to you guys. Surendralal Karsanbhai : No SPAC bubbles. David Farr : No SPAC bubbles. No SPAC bubbles. Steve, you're such an optimist. Thank you. James Froedge : One thing I want to follow up with Dave is you're absolutely right, what we're facing. But I didn't want to -- for all those on the call, this is -- we've seen these cycles before. I think the bounce back in volume is faster than we've seen before. Some of the materials issues are greater than the markets have experienced. However, we're confident that, throughout this year, as we go into early part of next year, the relationships we have with our customers, the contracts we have with our customers in regards to price and MI, it all works itself out.  So our focus right now is on partnering with those customers, getting the supply we need, making sure we meet their needs. But we also have very much in focus how this tends to play out in regards to the price and MI situation. So we'll be -- there'll be months where it's a little rocky as we chase things. There will other months that are fantastic as it flows through. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Thank you, Dave. And Lal, congratulations. Surendralal Karsanbhai : Thank you. Thank you, Andrew. Andrew Obin : So the question sort of maybe goes a little bit into what you guys are going to talk at the Analyst Day. But with Democratic control of the Senate, has the tone of the conversations with your customers regarding green opportunities has changed? And I think I'm specifically talking about things related to the grid as it relates to Ovation and maybe anything you're seeing on mining in terms of change in tone as it relates to EVs and batteries. David Farr : Okay. So before these two guys talk, we spent two hours with the Board today on this very topic because we've been working on it. The Board knows we have been working on it, so we made a decision to bring in the organization to talk about this today. And so I'll let Lal and Jamie talk because both sides of these guys' -- of our businesses are very much involved in this whole ESG, around the sustainability and renewable stuff. And I'll just let Lal go first, and then we'll let Jamie go on this one because that's a very relevant question. We are really relevant in the space, Andrew. Go ahead. Surendralal Karsanbhai : Yes. And you're right, Andrew. This is thematical for us in what we'll talk about in the February meeting. And we're very excited to share that with the investors and talk about the opportunities we have as Emerson. James Froedge : We're going to have a dedicated section on it, Andrew. Surendralal Karsanbhai : Now so the dimensions that we'll speak about are within Emerson, the greening of Emerson. It's the greening by Emerson as we aid our customers around various elements. And Andrew, you and I have spoken about decarbonization and energy efficiency and emissions management. And it's the greening with Emerson. So it's a partnering around solutions and organizations around the world.  We have -- we are in a unique position as an automation and as a commercial residential business to really fulfill what is a global demand and a global need here. So I'm pretty excited about where we sit. It's a growing business. There are various facets to it. We'll try to walk you guys through it. But over the last really two years, David, we've had a number of individuals around the world working there specifically. So I'm excited to share that with you on the 16th as is Jamie. David Farr : I think, around alternative energies, Andrew, I mean, we have a tremendous start in sight. I think we had the core technologies, as I told the Board. We're going to have to create some new technology solutions, both internally and externally, but we have the credibility with our customer base on some of these areas here.  There's going to be a lot of work that happens in the marketplace over the next 5 to 10 and 15 years. And I think we have a pretty good start. Jamie's -- and I'll let Jamie talk, but we've been working on this for quite some time. We've been involved with the whole thing around refrigerant efficiencies. You think of the changing technologies and stuff that's going on, we've been living that with the governments around the world now for well over 10 years, and there's some big moves happening right now. So that's why Jamie's business in Europe is so strong. So why don't you... James Froedge : No, I think that's a great point. Look, I think in general, it's a broader political topic around regulations. I'm not going to get into that. If you just look at how it could impact our markets, when there is a clear regulation that gets put in place, it gives clarity and certainty in decision-making around what people should purchase, what they have to purchase, what they need to do in order to meet whether its efficiency targets or its emissions targets, et cetera. So generally speaking, it's good for our business because we're delivering compression solutions that have better efficiency, that use lower-GWP refrigerants. We're the leader in waste disposal capabilities globally. And we got a lot of other markets that we'll talk to you about here as we go to the Investor Day.  But just in general terms, it's a very positive trend for our business because it gives certainty to folks around how they need to deploy their capital or where they need to spend their money. And as Dave said, we -- look, our engineers, our business leaders are on all the major committees around the world, have been for many, many years, that are driving these policies and driving the technical requirements around them, and we're ready for it. And in a lot of cases, the technology is already being developed and is getting ready to launch here in the next 18 months because we've seen this next transition coming, for example, on efficiency and low-GWP refrigerants. So... David Farr : I would say, in Lal's business, the automation business, our European team really pushes because they're not big oil refining business. We saw some push out of Asia when Jamie was in Asia, but the European -- and so they got it started about 2 years ago. And now with the acceleration of what's going on around the world, we have a very good running start from the standpoint of the opportunity. And that's what we want to share with you.  We're a combination of doing it ourself but also working with our customers and helping everyone reach these goals. But I'm pretty excited about this in automation and in commercial. And we have a unique situation for the next 5, 10, 15 years in the space. So I feel good about it. Andrew Obin : It sounds like you guys are going to have quite a bit to say about it at the Analyst Day. A follow-up question on software. I think you have sort of -- there are multiple definitions of software. But the stand-alone software, I think it's like, what, $1.1 billion. That's sort of the market I'm referring to. What kind of growth rates have you guys seen last quarter? And what are you expecting for the business to grow at this year? Surendralal Karsanbhai : Yes. We continue to see in that high single-digit range, Andrew, as we spoke about, I think, in the past. That seems to be consistent through Q1 and what we expect for the year. And again, we -- it's driven by a lot of work in life sciences. There's opportunities in the electrification grid you talked about but in core discrete and process as well. David Farr : Yes, I think, well, there'll be some years it's really strong, some years less, but I -- we're making good momentum there. And we're going to continue to invest in startups and ventures around this area because it's both internal, as you know, Andy -- Andrew -- sorry, Andrew, and then also through, obviously, trying to look at acquisitions.  But we have a good foothold in this right now. And it's really having a -- it's going to be a key port of -- part of what we're doing around sustainability too because it's not only doing it with the compression but using electronics and software. Same thing with a lot of software for Lal's business too as we... James Froedge : Yes. I mean, Dave, we were just talking about it the other day. When you start rolling out A2L refrigerants, low-GWP refrigerants, they're going to require -- it will be legal requirements around what -- the sensing you have to have, how often you have to monitor, how you have to remediate it if there's a leak or there's an issue. So as the world moves more and more in that direction, it's just going to require more insight real time to the data, and it's a huge opportunity for our business. David Farr : Andrew, so we have lot to say, but we only have so much time. Because unless they eliminate the former Chairman, we will run out of time. But -- and so they'll probably give me one chart : hello and goodbye. So we'll see. Andrew Obin : Thank you, Dave. And Lal, congrats again. Surendralal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Dave, congrats. We're really going to miss you. You're like the last of the Mohicans. You know that, right? I mean... David Farr : I know I'm the last of the Mohicans, truly the last of the Mohicans. Probably -- but that's okay. You guys can't handle many more Mohicans around here. Jeffrey Sprague : No, that's right. And no doubt Lal will do a great job. Congrats, Lal. Surendralal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Dave, I was wondering if you could address for us again, as all this succession was culminating, to what degree, if any, did kind of the discussion about, hey, maybe naming 2 CEOs and splitting Emerson at this particular juncture in its history? And clearly, where the decision landed is clear based on the discussion today. But kind of what, if any, was the debate around that and kind of the pros and cons in your mind? David Farr : Well, so not to sort of replay history, we went through that process back in 2019. So as we took the Board through for the -- June through the end of, say, November time period and we looked at the analysis of the 2 platforms, the strategic rationale around the two platforms, that was obviously on the table at that point in time. And the Board hired outside help relative to these 2 issues.  And their opinion and working with outside help, it was very clear and we fundamentally believe there's more value in the combined basis than separating the two businesses. And so the logic was around the investments we see going relative to this whole -- around the ESG, around sustainability, around software, what we see happening in the global world right now. As you look at the different cycles, the classics and what's going on right now in the 2 different cycles and how they leverage each other, that work was done back in the mid- to late 2019. The Board made a decision. And as we went through these last 18 months -- I guess it's not quite 18 but close to 18. I'll say 12 or 14 months. The Board never -- did not think about that at this point in time. They made that decision in a while back, and that's where it sits. And I -- obviously, clearly, from Lal's standpoint, the Board will continue to evaluate that in our strategy sessions with the Board -- or his strategy sessions with the Board. And I fundamentally believe that will constantly be on the table as we look at the mix of the businesses, if we look at where we want to go next and where we may want to get out of.  This company has been in and out of businesses. We get out of this business. We'll go here. And that's what's made Emerson unique. For the 40 years I've been around, if you look at the 40 years and how we transformed this company, let alone the 20 years I did, we don't sit still. So I mean, I guarantee, before Lal retires, the company will look different than it is today. Now how is it going to look differently? Well, that course will play its hand out with him and his team and the Board.  So that's how we look at it, Jeff. We don't look at trying to -- status quo is not a word around here, as you know. Jeffrey Sprague : Yes. No doubt. And I was also wondering, you've obviously worked extraordinarily hard to get costs out through this restructuring. When we think about these COVID-related temporary savings, only $40 million of which are coming back, how much of that kind of total $150 million do you think does come back? It sounds like you're working hard to really mitigate that even looking into 2022. David Farr : You're going to have -- it's going to be really hard to measure because you're -- by the time we get to '22, the business is growing again. So I would say, obviously, what we've learned through this process, some things will change. So certain things will be different from a meeting standpoint, travel standpoint. But at the same time, you're going to be looking at a company that's growing as you get into '22. It's going to be a solid growth year for 2022. But I mean, clearly, it's not dollar-for-dollar coming back, but you're going to be seeing growth investments happen at that point in time because we're growing. But I would say it's been hard for us to get an exact number, but we know it's not 100% coming back, but we also know it's not only 50%. So I mean I've always felt that we'll probably be somewhere around the 80%. 80% would probably have to come back over time and 20% we've learned from a different process.  But it's really what happens and what businesses grow, Jeff. It's -- but I guarantee we've learned a lot of different things here in the last -- not always a lot of fun things. Let's put it that way. But we've learned a lot. Operator : The next question comes from John Walsh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Walsh : A thank you to you, Dave, and a congratulations to Lal. Surendralal Karsanbhai : Thanks, John. John Walsh : So I noticed some new disclosure here in the back around software. I was just curious if this is just shuffling some things around for financial reporting or if you're changing the way some of this software actually goes through channel to your customers. David Farr : Fundamentally, as we've talked about, we're talking about trying to start to report on our software sales. We're in the early stages of what -- how we measure it. Because one thing you want to do, once you start going out with a measurement world -- in the accounting world, the columns are going to sit there. Auditor is going to look there, and they're going to say -- I see Frank shaking his head. No, he's -- so we've got to make sure we understand it exactly so we can measure it. A lot of companies don't worry about those things, but Emerson does worry about the integrity around the number.  So this is our first step. As we start talking about it, we want to make sure that we have really grounded numbers so when we tell you what that is, you know what it is, and you can measure it. So that -- it's a first-step process. That's all it is. Surendralal Karsanbhai : No change to channel, no change there to reporting just from that perspective... David Farr : We're going to start giving some more insights around software. That's all. John Walsh : Okay. Great. I look forward to that. And then, I guess, just on the free cash flow guidance, I guess, is there some working capital associated with the higher sales? It just seems like you took the earnings up higher than the free cash flow. I just wanted to understand the dynamic there a little bit. David Farr : Okay. So yes, what we see happening in this third and fourth quarter is growth will be pretty strong. Now as someone said earlier, Jamie has got a unique situation where he has -- his comparison to the third quarter is really easy so he could spike. And he doesn't know what it's going to be like in the fourth quarter. So we're trying to be cautious.  The other issue that we face right now and one of the reasons we had very, very strong operating cash flow in the first quarter -- yes, Lal's execution was very good. Yes, Jamie's execution was very good. But we're in a situation with Jamie's business that we haven't seen before of this magnitude, where all of a sudden, he's shipping using all the inventory can and from the standpoint of getting the inventory out getting paid and maybe not paying all the suppliers on the payable side standpoint. He's in a situation right now where his trade working capital as a percent of sale is extremely low, just where that's based out. And we know some of that will reverse as his business starts slowing down in certain areas.  So I think we want to be very cautious as they try to estimate how much was that cash pull-in because of the working capital, but it was a very good quarter on earnings and execution. And I think Frank and his team, as he talked to the financial officers out there, want to be a little bit more cautious. I think if we get a better feel in the second quarter, how the cash comes in, I think I wouldn't be surprised if we don't tweak it back up a little higher, John, to be all honest. But we're just being careful right now. But I think that the earnings and cash flow execution right now is very good. And we definitely will have cash burning as we get into that fourth quarter because of our growth rate. Operator : The next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Gautam Khanna : Congratulations. Congrats on the great run, Dave. David Farr : Thank you. Gautam Khanna : And congrats to Lal, and best of luck. Surendralal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Gautam. Gautam Khanna : I was going to ask you -- maybe you'll address this in a couple of weeks. But you hear the HVAC OEMs talk a lot about indoor air quality and that being a potential driver, especially in the commercial market, commercial HVAC market. I was wondering, does Emerson really play in that? Is there any specific products or solutions you guys are offering that might add another leg of growth to your commercial HVAC sales? James Froedge : Yes. We do. I mean some of it is direct, and some of it's indirect, right? Indirectly, as the OEMs work with different folks and they may put a broader air quality solution in place, it will often include an upgrade or a change out to the core compression solution.  I think the other piece around air quality is that tight humidity control, I think, would be a big component of that. And we found that a lot of the air quality solutions work better in a tighter humidity band. Our 7ac business that we just bought, we invested in early stage, then we bought it out, and now we're commercializing it. It is a business that has 30%, 35% more energy efficient at providing very tight humidity bands for the air handling space for, initially, commercial buildings, for example. And we'll do some of that directly, and we'll also sell some of that through some of our large OEM partners.  So there's multiple ways we play, and I think we'll continue to invest in that space as we go forward in both solutions with OEMs and maybe some that we sell direct to the end user base. But already, we see a lift from it today. David Farr : Yes. I think the key issue here, Gautam, is that what Jamie highlighted earlier in the conversation is that we see the states -- as we go through this current efficiency and refrigeration chains, we see the states putting in some controls and monitoring and some justification of where things sit, which will be sensing software based. And I think that's where we're going to be playing around this whole area because they're going to want to know that systems -- especially in the commercial area offering. So I think that will unfold here. That's something Jamie is going to talk about and we're investing in right now. But I think that efficiency does -- or air quality, efficiency, comfort does play for us. And so I think it's going to continue to build that way. I like that game for us. James Froedge : We always talk about automation. We work in that business close, and we have a closed loop between control system and our final control element or measurement element. If you think about the air quality space, fundamentally, it's moving in that direction. You've got to close the loop. You got to close the loop between the monitoring, the electronics, the controls, humidification, particulate management.  And so if you -- for example, if you have a large commercial or residential thermostat business that's tied to key diagnostics and electronics, then you've got a big part of the puzzle there. And there's partnerships that you can have around those other pieces to close the loop and build a full solution. So we'll talk more about it in a couple of weeks, but we're very active in that space, and I think we'll do more there going forward. David Farr : What else you want to know, Gautam? Gautam Khanna : Yes. Just a second question maybe at Automation Solutions. So obviously, the order comparisons get a lot easier come May and June when you're comping down 13%, down 19% in orders. And what is the right expectation? I mean, I know you gave the second half guidance for the range at automation. But are we going to see a bigger snapback in the absence of KOB1 kicking in where we could see a double-digit month or 2 or 3 as we get to the third quarter or the fourth quarter? Surendralal Karsanbhai : Gautam, I think your assumption is right. We should not expect the KOB1 activity for the next 12 to 18 months. I don't foresee that. More significant, KOB2; and obviously, what we've been living on, KOB3, certainly. What I will tell you is that snapback is fully dependent on what happens in North America. David Farr : U.S.A. Surendralal Karsanbhai : Period. End of story. And that's really the -- that will measure the dimension of how it quickly comes back, how hard that snapback is. David Farr : I think we're trying to be cautious, but I think you'll watch the order pattern that these guys will put out because we're not going to stop that. I'm assuming Lal's not going to stop that. He may make that decision, but just watch and see what happens from that standpoint. Operator : The final question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Dave, it's been a pleasure. Enjoy retirement. Get a few more dogs. Take in a few more Cardinals games. I'll certainly miss you in Laguna. Lal, congratulations and good luck. You don't need it for sure. Surendralal Karsanbhai : Thank you. Joshua Pokrzywinski : But onto the question side of things. If I look at auto sol, kind of a similar angle is what was brought up before on C&RS. It looks like, for the second half, the range got a little wider and maybe a little bit lower. I know that, Lal and Dave, you guys both talked about KOB3 and kind of the process energy complexes being guidance parameters or drivers of the high end versus the low end last quarter. How do you see those evolving? What are the drivers of that range today? And how important is kind of that KOB3 process bucket? David Farr : So I'll give my answer, and I'll give -- I know -- I mean I know how these guys are thinking right now. They've had a couple of good quarters. They're still negative, Josh, as you clearly see. They've been very cautious relative to taking the back end up. So I think they've been -- as -- you're right. As they got a little bit better in the second and third, they'd probably get a little bit on the fourth as they look at the quarter.  And so I think they're just -- I think these guys are being cautious because we have not seen the pure whites of the eye relative to that U.S. recovery. I think if we get a month or 2 where we see that consistent KOB3, KOB2 type of ordering in the U.S.A. like we've been seeing in Asia, like you're seeing in Europe, I think these guys will get a little more comfortable relative to that volume and that profit coming in. So I think they're just -- that's my impression of these guys. They've gone through a tough market here, a cost reset. And no one wants to say, hey, this thing is over, let's just go. I mean it's just like Jamie. Jamie was cautious a couple of quarters ago. Now as he's running through, he has -- it's hard for him to hide. So I think that's my feel. Anything you want to say there? James Froedge : No. I would add -- I think it's well said, David. Obviously, we're watching things like site access very carefully in terms of our engagements with customers; the spring outage schedules, which are holding right now, which is very important as well. Those are all positive signs. David Farr : The short date -- I mean, your order pattern. So what day to day -- what was your day-to-day order this month? What do you think it's going to be? James Froedge : In the month of January, it will land somewhere between $40 million and $43 million, somewhere in there, a day. David Farr : So that's a good number. That means he's coming back. So I think he's gaining -- everything's holding that we talked about from the standpoint, Josh. And now he just wants to see a couple of months of that continue. I mean you saw the early signs in December. If January gets the details, we want to analyze the details. That would be good. Early at first half of February, he gets into the investor conference, then I think he's going to say, okay, it's definitely taking hold firmly, just like we said 3 or 4 months ago with Jamie's business. So I think that's what it is. But all the signs are doing the right things. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then going to the longer cycle end of the equation, the longer projects that got shelved with COVID, do you guys think that those come back off the shelf? Do we like the slate clean, start over just given that the world has changed so much? What are you hearing? What are you talking about with your customers today? Do we have a scenario where those come off, plus we have post COVID, kind of new projects and a nirvana scenario? Just happy to weigh in on all fronts there would be great. Surendralal Karsanbhai : Yes, I'll give you a quick color. The funnel sits at about $6.5 billion. It really appreciably has not changed for the last 3 months. What happened within that funnel, there were a number of cancellations, but they were replaced by a high number of smaller jobs. So quicker paybacks, those types of things.  In addition to that, what's been interesting is we now have about a $1.6 billion electrification project funnel, which OSI brought to us. So that's in addition to the $6.4 billion KOB1 funnel that we've been talking about traditionally. We'll talk about this a little bit more in detail in a few weeks. But overall, feel that those projects are going to eventually move forward. It's just a matter of time here around demand. David Farr : Yes. I think from my perspective, as I hear from customers, I think they're going to -- Lal's projects will sort of be recut differently. The pressures on the CEO is relative to capital and things like that. So I think the projects, they are good projects. They will move forward, but they might be smaller. They might be cut a little bit differently.  I think there's been a lot of discipline in our customer base around spending capital that's been learned the old-fashioned way through a lot of pain, like broken legs, broken arms, a couple of knives in the back. And so I think that I feel good they're going to be good. There'll be obviously some leaves, some new. But overall, I think it's going to be done. And I think Lal's got one more to say. Surendralal Karsanbhai : Yes, just one more thing. To your point, David, you're exactly right. If your project was a \"bottom of the barrel\" type of refinery project, that got scrapped. If your project is a conversion to a biofuel refinery, those projects are moving forward. There are many active in the United States and Europe, and we're very engaged in those processes. David Farr : It's going to be -- it will be a good -- that will be more late '21, early '22, Josh, as I see it right now. I think -- so Lal's team's got a lot of work they got to get done. They've got a lot of repositioning work in the facilities underway right now in Europe. And he's got to get that done because his business is coming back, and he can use capacity around the world right now to cover it. But when he starts getting all the world area markets going, he's got to get those new facilities up and running.  With that, I want to thank everybody. And again, I will get back to people on the e-mails. It's going to take me a while. And I truly appreciate what people send to me in faxes and e-mails, and I look for it. Lal and I will try to get in before I fully go out to pasture. We will try to get into New York and I have some sessions trying to help Lal. I most likely will probably bring Jamie along just so he can learn, too. But we want to do that. That's part of my learnings that I could pass on to these guys, these gentlemen.  And I have been doing this a long time, as you know, not only 20 years as CEO, but I was, when I came back from Asia, I became the spokesperson for Emerson for those 3 years. And I was an investor relations guy for multiple years -- well, 18 months.  But I look forward to seeing all of you, and I truly appreciate everything you've done for me over the years and keep me straight, keep me honest and challenge me and disagree with me. I love that. Take care. Bye. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Pete Lilly, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Pete Lilly : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Emerson\u2019s second quarter earnings and conference call. Today, I\u2019m joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Frank Dellaquila; and Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan. I encourage you to follow along the discussion with the accompanying slide presentation, which is available on our website. Please join me on Slide 2. As always, this present may include some forward-looking statements, which contain a degree of business risk and uncertainty. Turning to Slide 3, I\u2019d like to briefly highlight that Emerson has been publishing a Corporate Social Responsibility report for many years now. We have renamed the report the Emerson Environmental, Social and Governance Report and are excited to highlight all of the goals, momentum and global standards that our organization is working towards. In particular, our environmental sustainability framework, greening of Emerson, by Emerson and with Emerson, captures our internal sustainability efforts, our enablement of our customers\u2019 sustainability journeys through our products and solutions, and our collaboration efforts with various sustainability stakeholders. I encourage you to review the document next month when it is published. As always, I am available for questions. Please turn to Slide 4. I\u2019d like to briefly mention our recent Emerson Exchange Virtual Series, which took place from November through March. Emerson Exchange is a chance for our customer base to interact with other users, industry experts and Emerson technology leaders. Despite the obvious in-person limitations of the pandemic, Emerson had a tremendously successful virtual engagement with customers, focusing on digital transformation, sustainability, technology and many other topics. This virtual framework dramatically expanded the reach of this already very popular user event. Due to the success of the hybrid format, we will likely be adopting such a format going forward. More details to follow as the time and place for the next Emerson Exchange event is finalized. Please turn to Slide 5, and I will now turn the call over to Lal Karsanbhai for opening remarks. Over to you, Lal. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Pete, and good morning, everyone. I would like to say a few things before passing it on to Frank. Firstly, to our global team, three things. Thank you for a tremendous quarter. This was one that was delivered based on strong execution, which required agility and creativity as we jumped over a number of hurdles over the last three months. The result was top-class profit leverage over 40% across our operations. Well done by everyone. Momentum is building, and it\u2019s more broadly today and across a large number of our markets than it was three months ago. This expansion across both platforms, now as the cycle expands, will enable us to make critical technology investments, building on our strong differentiation and customer relevance. Lastly, to the teams, thank you for welcoming me during my first 90 days and thank you for your energy and passion. You energize me every day in the journey and on the journey that we\u2019re taking together. Secondly, I would like to recognize David Farr, who stepped -- whose Board service concluded today after more than 20 years. Thank you, David, for your many contributions. And last, but not least, I would like to extend a warm welcome to Jim Turley, elected by the Board of Directors yesterday to be Emerson\u2019s new Nonexecutive Chair. Jim is a highly qualified Independent Director who is extremely passionate about people, culture and the future of Emerson. I look forward to working alongside Jim and our entire Board. Frank, over to you. Frank Dellaquila : Thank you, Lal. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. We had a strong quarter and I\u2019d like to take you through the highlights of that over the next several slides. The strengthening recovery that Lal referred to in most of our end markets, combined with the benefits from our cost reset actions, drove strong operating performance and strong financial results in the second quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.97, ahead of our guidance midpoint of $0.89 and representing 9% growth versus the prior year. Demand strengthened significantly with sales ahead of expectations at 2% underlying growth and March orders towards the high end of expectations at 4% underlying growth. Within that growth number for the orders, significantly Automation Solutions continues its steady improvement in both orders and sales, while Commercial & Residential Solutions continues to experience robust demand across all its lines of business and in all geographies with 11% sales growth and 21% orders growth for the trailing three months through March. The cost reset benefits for the program that we implemented almost two years ago are being realized as planned, driving adjusted segment EBIT growth of 15% and 150 basis points of increased margin at 19.1%. Additionally, cash flow continues to be strong, up 37% year-over-year with free cash flow up nearly 50%. This represents 125% conversion of net earnings. We continue to execute on the remaining elements of our cost reset actions, with the bulk of it behind us at this point, we initiated $21 million of additional restructuring in the quarter. Please turn to the next slide if you would for comments on the EPS. The EPS bridge operational performance was very strong in the quarter adding $0.14 to adjusted EPS. As we guided in February, stock compensation was a significant headwind in the quarter due to the mark-to-market impact, which was caused by the difference in the share price at the end of last year\u2019s second quarter and this year\u2019s second quarter. Of course, you\u2019ll recall that last year, share prices in general were all severely depressed with the onset of COVID and we closed last year\u2019s second quarter at $48 versus $90 this year. And that headwind was within $0.01 of the guidance that we gave you in February. Tax, currency and other miscellaneous items netted to about $0.04 of tailwind and a small impact from share repurchase. So in total, again, adjusted EPS was $0.97 versus the guided $0.89. Please go to the next slide for comments on the P&L. So as I mentioned, underlying sales growth exceeded expectations at 2% and it was 6% on a reported basis, including acquisitions and currency. Gross profit slipped just a bit, 10 basis points, mainly due to business mix, given the growth in our Commercial & Residential Solutions business. SG&A increased by 10 basis points, but the real story here is that excluding the stock compensation impact, operationally, it was down 220 basis points, indicative of the magnitude of the cost reduction activity and the flow-through of the benefits. We had very strong leverage on SG&A and the spend was actually down year-over-year when you exclude the impact of the stock comp. Adjusted EBIT margin was 18.2%. Our effective tax rate was within a point of last year. Share count at $603 million, and again, adjusted EPS of $0.97. Please turn to the next slide. We\u2019ll talk about earnings and cash flow. Adjusted segment EBIT increased 15%, with the margin increasing 150 basis points to 19.1%, as I said earlier. Leverage on the volume and cost reset benefits offset the material cost headwinds that we did see in the quarter. Again, stock comp was nearly $100 million headwind. It was partially offset by some other corporate items. Adjusted pre-tax earnings were down 20 basis points to 17.3% again as the impact of the mark-to-market on the stock comp flows through. Operating cash flow was very strong, almost a record again at $807 million, up 37%. Free cash flow at $707 million was up 48%, driven by strong earnings and favorable balance sheet items. Lastly, trade working capital was down to 16.8% of sales as the impact in the distortions from the COVID-related volume decline are beginning to normalize and as the businesses did a good job managing inventory as we return to growth. Please turn to the next slide. We\u2019ll go through Automation Solutions. Orders continue to turn upward here. We were at negative 5% on a trailing three-month basis, making good progress, and we\u2019re on the trajectory that we\u2019ve been mapping out for several months. Underlying sales were above expectations at negative 2% and we\u2019re encouraged to see the continued sequential improvement in order rates underpinning the sales. China was very strong, and they were favorable comps, but also due to good strength in discrete, clinical and energy markets. Our demand in North America improved sequentially, but it did lag other world areas. However, there are noteworthy pockets of growth, very encouraging signs in both discrete, life science, food and beverage, and power generation. Importantly, we also continue to see increasing KOB3 activity across process automation customer base, driven by increased SGOs and focused spend on OpEx and productivity. Margin in the platform increased 180 basis points of adjusted EBIT, 230 basis points and adjusted EBITDA, driven by the cost reset savings. The OSI integration continues to go well. The effective synergies are being realized and we are increasingly encouraged in validating the case that we made for the acquisition when we did it last October. Backlog is roughly flat sequentially at $5.3 billion, but it is up 14% year-to-date. Please turn to the next slide and we\u2019ll review Commercial & Residential Solutions. The story here is very, very strong growth. Orders continue to strengthen with the March underlying trailing three-month rate at 21%. The demand is primarily driven by ongoing strength in residential end markets, but significantly cold chain, professional tools and other commercial and industrial markets are also picking up and contributing to the growth. All businesses in all regions were positive indicative of the trend. Strong growth in China, over 50%, was attributable to commercial HVAC and cold chain demand in addition to the favorable comp. Europe grew 9% on the strength of continued demand for heat pumps and other energy-efficient sustainable solutions. Margins improved 40 basis points at the adjusted EBIT level. Cost reduction benefits were somewhat offset by price cost headwinds, which we\u2019ll discuss a little more when we cover the guidance. Commercial & Residential backlog has increased almost 60% year-to-date to about $1 billion. This is about $400 million above what we would consider normal for this business. Operations are working through the significant challenges to meet strong customer demand across most of the businesses in this platform. Please go to the next slide and we\u2019ll talk about the updated guidance for the year. Based on the strength we see in orders and the increasing pace of business, we\u2019re very encouraged and we are improving our sales outlook for the year. We now expect underlying sales in the range of 3% to 6% overall, with Automation Solutions roughly flat and Commercial & Residential up in the 12% to 14% range. The stronger volume will drive improved profitability. We now expect 17.5% adjusted EBIT margin for the entire enterprise. Cash flow was also projected higher at $3.3 billion, operating cash flow and $2.7 billion of free cash flow, an increase of $150 million. Our tax, capital spending, dividend, share repurchase assumptions remain as they were. We are raising adjusted EPS guidance by $0.20 at the midpoint from $3.70 to $3.90 and we\u2019re tightening the range to plus or minus $0.05 from plus or minus $0.10. We\u2019re doing this, increasing the guidance in the face of additional headwinds to profitability because we\u2019re very encouraged by the underlying strength of the business and the read-through of the cost reset actions that the business has been working very diligently now for almost two years. The additional headwinds you can see in the margin there on the right of the slide, mainly $50 million more of unfavorable price cost, driven by continuing increases in raw materials costs and about another $20 million of stock comp expense versus what we estimated back in February. The speed and the magnitude of the price increases in key inputs, steel, copper, plastic resins is unprecedented. Operations are actively and effectively working to mitigate the margin impact through selected price and cost containment actions, and the good work that they are doing gives us the confidence to raise the guidance, despite these increased headwinds. On the plus side, we expect to retain about $10 million more in the year of the COVID-related savings than we previously estimated as basic activity like travel and everything that goes with it comes back in more slowly than we would have thought a couple of months ago. If you please go to the next slide, I\u2019ll give you an update on orders. So as I mentioned earlier, our underlying trailing three-month orders turned positive in the month of March with 4%. This is consistent with the upper range of the guidance that we provided to you in February. It\u2019s driven by ongoing strength in Commercial & Residential Solutions as you can see at 21% and continued significant improvement in Automation Solutions as our global markets recovered and increasingly we see improvement in our traditional process industries as well in North America. We expect general demand to remain strong for the balance of the year. We expect the Automation Solutions markets to accelerate in the second half and the Commercial & Residential HVAC demand will taper off somewhat later in the year, but we would expect to see some of the other end markets, commercial, professional tools and such, recover to partially offset that tapering off in Commercial & Residential. So, all in all, we believe we have a good outlook for the second half of the year. If you please go to the next slide, the underlying sales growth outlook. Based on what we see in the pace of the improvement in orders, for the second half, we see growth in the high-single digits range at about 7% to 11% and that will drive the full year growth of 3% to 6%. We expect net sales to be just a bit above $18 billion. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Lal and he\u2019ll talk about our business and end market outlook in more detail. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Frank. I\u2019ll just cover a few charts here with the group. Again, increased momentum -- turning to - on chart 15 here. First on Automation Solutions. We are -- we were lagged through the recovery in the first half by our discrete and early cycle businesses within the platform. And essentially, what\u2019s occurred as we\u2019ve navigated through the second quarter is a broader recovery in their mid -- in the mid-cycle elements of this platform. So we see a return to growth in Q3, which is very positive, after five down quarters in this business and a continued demand in short cycle, as well as that acceleration in the core process automation markets in the back half of the year, yielding a 4% to 8% range in the second half and a flat year guidance on sales. If you turn to Page 16, I\u2019ll give you some color on what\u2019s going on in the world areas. Perhaps before I do that though, I\u2019ll just paint it from a KOB perspective. KOB3 has been incredibly strong, both in our discrete spaces, but more interestingly as we navigated this second quarter into our process basis. Frank referenced the shutdown turnaround activity, which is up double-digit -- mid double teens for the year and the STO schedules are holding and full honestly as we go into the summer into the fall season, which is very encouraging. The site walk downs are up almost 50% year-over-year, also very encouraging and, of course, the long-term service agreements are up almost 40% across the world in the business. Very encouraging to see and really provides the fuel for the underlying activity we\u2019re seeing in the process space. On our KOB1 basis, things are not completely stopped. There\u2019s less activity. Obviously, we digested a significant LNG weight, but there\u2019s more activity on the horizon. We\u2019ve entered the feed stage on two very important projects : the Baltic LNG and the Golden Island BASF in China. Those are important opportunities for us in Automation. And secondly, we were awarded the Sempra Costa Azul LNG project on the Pacific Coast in the Baja Peninsula of Mexico, which has a significant value for us and was awarded and will be booked here in the third quarter. So there is some activity. We continue to engage on the KOB1. And as that starts to loosen up a little bit, I think, we\u2019re very well-positioned. The tale of the tape, honestly, for the remainder of the year for this business is going to be the Americas. And it\u2019s going to be a significant swing from a down 16% first half to a second half in that 10% midpoint. And we\u2019ll see that, we saw that already as we entered April. We will continue to see that recovery, I think, as we go through the latter half of the year into 2022. Europe, an incredibly strong first half, driven by life sciences, activity around biofuels, the number of KOB2-type project awards and we continue to see that strength and I feel confident that that strength will be there into the second half of the year. Of course, across all of this, the discrete environment has been very, very good into Asia, Europe and in North America, whether it\u2019s automotive, medical or semiconductor, and we expect that strength to remain here. So, overall, feeling much better about the second half here and feeling very good about how North America is shaping up for us in Automation. Turning to Chart 17, some comments on Commercial & Residential. What a great year this team is having and, obviously, the beneficiaries of a tremendous residential cycle, much of which was driven by pandemic inventory levels, pre-pandemic inventory levels, a pre-build in the cooling season that then we also benefited from a secular shift into suburbs and high-family home construction and renovation. All of that has led into incredible residential strength through the year. Obviously, my expectation is that first to dampen as we get into the latter parts of the fiscal year. However, the mid-cycle professional tools, cold chain businesses are accelerating and that\u2019s where we see here in this very balanced perspective for this business throughout 2021 and I\u2019m very encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in the later cycle pieces. Of course, we -- there\u2019s some good underlying technology evolutions as well that will impact the residential, be it the refrigerant changes or the heat pump moves in Europe, which are -- which will continue to drive good growth for the businesses. And then turning to Page 18, again, a very balanced picture here from a world area perspective. And overall, a strong second half with the Commercial Industrial segment of this business continuing to improve as the residential market start to taper, as I discussed. I think all the world areas should grow, again, in the low double-digit to mid-teen range as we go into the second half. In the Americas, we are seeing residential demand remain strong in the near-term and the commercial markets really starting to accelerate. And the cold chain piece particularly, which is driven by transport and aftermarket and then we see the tools momentum building in the professional channel. So very encouraged by that. Europe, I mentioned heat pump activity. We expect that to stay strong, and, of course, a surge in construction should bolster our plumbing and electrical tools business. And then lastly, in Asia, China is the headline contributor to growth as some of you\u2019ve already noted and demand is driven by commercial air conditioning and cold chain solutions. So, with that, Pete, I\u2019ll turn it to Page 19 and we\u2019ll go to Q&A. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Walsh : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Lal Karsanbhai : Hi, John. Good morning. Frank Dellaquila : Good morning. Ram Krishnan : Good morning. John Walsh : Hi. So, obviously, a lot of focus will probably be on the Americas recovery, just wanted to get your perspective in Auto Sols, kind of how much of this is driven by kind of just run rating the trends you\u2019re seeing in process against an easy compare versus kind of the growth you expect to see in those discrete and hybrid markets there? Lal Karsanbhai : Well, we\u2019re seeing, John, good acceleration in underlying process. We went through a period of time, as you recall, of break/fix environment with limited site access, with limited FDL type of activity. That slipped. Obviously, the inoculation rates in this country have helped the confident that customers have and having others on-site and having their own folks, very honestly on-site. That\u2019s driven now a level of activity that is incredibly encouraging and is, I think, above and beyond just the simple comparisons that we have. The discrete strength, to your point, will remain. I don\u2019t foresee that to wane, at least as we go through the year in North America, but the real fuel there will be increased activity. And we\u2019re seeing that in the PO rates and we\u2019re seeing that in quotation activity and in the daily booking activity in our short- to medium-cycle automation businesses. John Walsh : Great. Thank you. And then, obviously, you updated your view here on inflationary pressure. Just as we think about the balance of the year, could you talk a little bit about the price/cost equation and if there\u2019s kind of any noticeable difference kind of Q3 versus Q4 and any timing of price related to that? Thank you. Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah. I\u2019ll comment. We -- as Frank noted, we adjusted our guide there from the $25 million headwind to $75 million. Again, within the construct of what we believe we can guide the overall EPS, the teams are doing a fabulous job in particularly around the headwinds of classic resins, copper and steel, which have been challenging for us. I would expect as capacity comes online, John, that the -- that there is a little bit of relief on price/cost. But again, that\u2019s a wait and see, so we took a more conservative approach there based on what we\u2019re seeing in the market and as we\u2019ve discussed with the teams. Ram, any comments there? Ram Krishnan : Yeah. I think and we do expect the bulk of the impact, frankly, in Q3 and Q4. We didn\u2019t see much of an impact in the first half as we worked down inventory. But the impact of steel and copper and resin will see in the second half. But as Lal mentioned, we do expect, particularly in steel, capacity to come back online. Certainly, our pricing on steel in China is better than what we see in North America. So, hopefully, as we get into the later part of the year, we\u2019ll start that -- seeing that steel pricing soften a little bit. So that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s built into the plan. John Walsh : Great. I\u2019ll pass it along. Thank you. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, John. Operator : The next question will come from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicole DeBlase : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Lal Karsanbhai : Hi, Nicole. Frank Dellaquila : Good morning. Ram Krishnan : Hi, Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : Hi, there. So maybe we could talk a little bit about what\u2019s going on with respect to supply chain, obviously, a really hot issue this quarter. So if you guys could talk about what you\u2019re seeing and to what extent that could be, I guess, a cap to upside to revenues in the second half? Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah. So, certainly, a lot of press on supply chain, obviously, in terms of inflation, but also availability and shortage challenges. For example, you\u2019ve probably heard the electronics challenges on chip shortages. Frankly, our global teams, I would say, at this point, have done a remarkable job from an availability standpoint, whether its availability of steel, plastic, resin, where we\u2019ve been able to move to alternatives. Certainly, on the electronics front, we\u2019ve managed through our supply in terms of electronics supply from Asia pretty well. The inflation side, we\u2019re managing through that. I think that is something through price and productivity programs, we\u2019re addressing. But to this point, we haven\u2019t seen any availability challenges. And similarly on the logistics front, whether its ground, ocean freight or airfreight, our teams have done a really good job locking in the needed capacity to bring in material from our overseas supply chains, and frankly, at preferred rates. We haven\u2019t had to go out into the spot market yet, which is where we\u2019re seeing a lot of that inflation. So, so far, I would say, we\u2019re managing through it pretty well. And the other piece I would want to point out is our regionalization strategy, where we really have regional supply chains supporting our business has been a significant benefit where we haven\u2019t had to rely significantly on overseas supply chains to feed our plants. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. Thanks. That\u2019s really helpful. And then, I guess, thinking about the cadence of EPS revenue margins in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter, anything you guys want to highlight there? I think usually you give us kind of a sense of what the next quarter\u2019s earnings will look like. So just anything you want to provide on 3Q versus 4Q? Frank Dellaquila : Well, Nicole. Hi. This is Frank. I think we\u2019re looking in a very, very strong third quarter coming at us just based on the orders that we see and the backlog that we have available to us. So I would say, at this point, as I look at second half, third quarter will be very strong, the fourth quarter will be good but a little less visibility into the fourth. So that\u2019s kind of how we see it right now, maybe it\u2019s a tad frontloaded towards the third quarter. Operator : The next question will come from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Lal Karsanbhai : Hi, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Very different feel to the call today. Good to hear Frank\u2019s voice. Hi. Can you hear me okay? Frank Dellaquila : Thank you. Thank you, Nigel. Nigel Coe : So, Com & Res - good. So on Com Res, $0.11 growth, nothing to phase out very strong orders. But the growth rates come in a little bit lighter than some of your OEM customers and there\u2019s a deceleration from Q-to-Q. It looks like we\u2019ve got some nice acceleration come into the back half of the year. But just curious how inventory levels look in the channels and whether you saw some destocking happening during Q2, just curious on that? Frank Dellaquila : Yeah. And -- thanks, Nigel. Good to hear your voice as well. I think there\u2019s a dynamic here between residential and commercial in Com & Res across the broad business and that\u2019d be our climate into the tools as well, which is - has an impact there in terms of growth rates. We\u2019re seeing many of our OEM customers have reported with strong residential growth. Now, although, we have that, we have a balance in our business between cold chain and NAC. So I think that\u2019s where you probably see that difference. Nigel Coe : Great. And just a bit of a random question here, Lal. But on the Emerson Exchange of the virtual this year, I mean, how does that play out going forward? I mean, how do you judge the sort of the engagement with customers virtually versus in-person and how do you think that evolves\u2026 Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah. Nigel Coe : \u2026 going forward? Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah. No. Great question, Nigel. And I know you\u2019ve attended the Exchange. It\u2019s a very special event for us in Automation, as you know, and we get great customer engagement throughout. We learned a lot, and, obviously, we didn\u2019t have a choice as we went through an Exchange season in the Americas and Europe this year. But I think what we learned is that there\u2019s got to be a balance. I think there\u2019s going to be a way to engage with folks on the ground and we don\u2019t want to get away from that if we have the opportunity to do so. But we can also reach a much broader base of engagement with customers through the virtual platform, customers who may not be able to devote a day or night of travel, who may be interested in a singular subject or a keynote, they now have the opportunity to dial in and listen in or see that presentation in a form that works for them. So I think it\u2019s going to be a balance. I think some of that engagement is still going to be important, because as you know, as you saw when you were there with us in Nashville, there is a lot of customer engagement where the value really comes in from those discussions. So we don\u2019t want to lose that. It\u2019s -- I think we, in this new construct, I think, can reach a broader base of folks while not losing the original intent of the meeting. So I\u2019m excited about Exchange. I hope we can hold it in the fall. The guys are talking about the fall versus spring right now. We\u2019ll see where we land. Nigel Coe : Thanks, Lal. Best of luck. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Nigel. Operator : The next question will come from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning Julian Mitchell : Maybe -- good morning. Maybe a first question on the margin outlook. You raised the EBIT margin guide to that 17.5% number for the year as a whole. I just wanted to double check sort of as we think about the second half specifically. It seems to imply maybe a sort of mid-20%s incremental on the segment level and maybe a little bit lower than that sort of all in because of the corporate aspect and so on. Just wanted to confirm if that\u2019s roughly the right math and any difference in incremental margins in the second half for the two divisions, AS versus Com & Res? Frank Dellaquila : Yeah. I mean, I think, that\u2019s in the -- you\u2019re talking about now the incrementals with leverage. I think that\u2019s in the ballpark, Julian. Hi, this is Frank. It\u2019s in the ballpark. I mean, the incrementals I would expect to be higher in Automation Solutions. We will have to digest the price cost headwinds in Commercial & Residential and that will be a headwind for certain on the incrementals. Nonetheless, we\u2019re going to deliver good incremental profits in the business and we will have leverage on those sales. But no doubt that it\u2019ll hold those incremental down at least for the next couple of quarters. So I think you\u2019d expect to see to be higher in Automation Solutions than in Com & Res. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much, Frank. And then maybe a broader question around Automation Solutions, sort of top line outlook and the end market backdrop there. So we saw that the backlog was sort of flattish sequentially up, I think, mid-single digits year-on-year. How do we think about that Auto Sol backlog trending from here? Understood that maybe big projects are relatively sparse, but maybe the KOB2 stuff picks up. How do we think about that AS backlog the pace of the pickup from here? Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah. Good question, Julian. I - so year-over-year backlog in Automation is up 14%, I believe, is the number. Obviously, we went through a significant, through the first two quarters I\u2019d suggest that in terms of shifting KOB1 activity, we have particularly in our final control and systems businesses, and the fuel of the revenue growth going forward becomes more mid-cycle measurement solutions and systems and discrete business. So consequently, that\u2019s more what we\u2019d call book to ship within quarter or within quarter and a half. And I wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect a significant growth in the backlog, but within the parameters that we\u2019re in today. So in that I suggest 10% to 15% backlog growth. So without the vast KOB1 activity, I don\u2019t expect that to grow beyond the rate we\u2019re in today. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Hi. Good morning, guys. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning. Frank Dellaquila : Good morning. Scott Davis : Encouraging -- good morning. Comments -- encouraging comments you made on April. It must\u2019ve been a pretty darn good month. But I had a couple kind of completely different questions since, Lal, you\u2019re relatively new. I mean, your compensation structure is a little bit complex for your management team. Is there \u2013 is that one of the things you\u2019re working on kind of adjusting early in your tenure here? Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah. So, yeah, good to hear from you and thanks. April, I did make the comment April from an Automation perspective and Commercial & Residential perspective continues to be on trend to what we have experienced and have expectations around. So I\u2019m encouraged by that. In terms of the comp structure, yeah, I\u2019ve spoken openly about the journey we\u2019re on in our culture and what we\u2019re undertaking here as an organization. I think there\u2019s a lot of energy around that across the enterprise. Compensation is absolutely something that we\u2019re looking at. And we actually -- we have a task force in place today led by Lisa Flavin and she is looking through how we compensate the executive structure and others. And I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity there for us. And we\u2019ll be -- we will take our time. We\u2019ll work very closely with the Board on that as we go through the summer and to the fall, and hope we have an evolution there as well. Scott Davis : Okay. Good. And just as an unrelated follow-up, the heat pump market in Europe, you guys have been talking about for a couple of quarters now. Does your product have technological differentiation? I mean, perhaps, you can maybe talk through kind of why you guys think you\u2019ll win in the heat pump market? Lal Karsanbhai : I think there -- I think we\u2019re very well-positioned, obviously, with a strong customer base we\u2019ve had for a long time. But I think the technology differentiated is really around sound attenuation in the heat pumps and the efficiency. And I think that\u2019s where we stand out versus what the marketplace offers and has been a big part of the growth in what fuels the European opportunity going forward. So we\u2019re excited about where the product investments have been and where we can grow going forward. Scott Davis : Sounds good. Good luck, guys. Thank you. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys. Good morning. Frank Dellaquila : Hey, Steve. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning. Ram Krishnan : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Strange to be on an Emerson call in the morning. Usually, we have to wait all day for this. So thanks for that. The -- just looking at your comparison versus 2019. So your sales in the first half are down relative to 2019. Your EPS is up very comfortably, like, $0.20-plus. If I just take the back half of 2019 on EPS and add it to what you just did in the first half of 2021, you\u2019re already kind of at the high end of your guidance range. The sales comps year-over-year should be pretty similar to down moderately versus 2019 still. What\u2019s kind of the big headwind in the second half? I know price cost maybe is like a $0.05 or something like that. I don\u2019t know it, but it seems like you\u2019re growing very strongly over 2019 without the benefit of revenue already. But in the back half, you really don\u2019t show any material improvement whatsoever versus 2019, maybe you could just like help us with the moving parts there. Frank Dellaquila : Yeah. So, Steve, this is Frank. I mean, the obvious thing in the second half that were not headwinds in 2019 are both the price/cost and the stock comp, so between the two of those you\u2019ve got $70 million, $75 million of headwind, $0.08 to $0.10, to take your point. But we\u2019re waiting to get better visibility into the fourth quarter. At this point, we understand that when you make the comparisons to 2019, it\u2019s not a big increase over the second half of 2019. But we do have some uncertainty to work through as we go through the second half here and we\u2019re going to see how that plays out. We think the guidance raise at this point is prudent and we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll get there and then some as we work our way through this. Steve Tusa : And then just on the HVAC side, different players putting up different types of results all very strong from a customer perspective. I know you guys have like kind of a big end to calendar year last year. What did you see in your kind of U.S. resi kind of core compressor business this quarter roughly? Lal Karsanbhai : So, Steve, this is Lal. Yeah. So, we had a strong -- we had a very strong quarter in the climate business in the United States. We continue to see orders accelerate. Backlog conversion grew in the mid-single digits, excuse me, sales grew in the mid-single digits, and with the acceleration really occurring, as Frank pointed out, into Q3 for us. And that\u2019s where you\u2019ll see this really from a U.S. - purely U.S. perspective in HVAC pop for us. Steve Tusa : Right. And then just one quick one, how big is that business now as a percentage of CR&S? I mean, historically, everybody kind of thought of you as a U.S. resi play. I mean, given you\u2019ve smashed these businesses together and China remains a big driver and Europe is growing fast. I mean, how big is that kind of core U.S. compressor business now for you guys as a percentage of CR&S? Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah. It\u2019s a sizable business. We haven\u2019t disclosed the size of it relative to the entire platform. But you can assume it\u2019s a sizable portion of \u2013 in the entire climate and CR&S platform. Steve Tusa : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Steve. Operator : The next question will come from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Yes. Good morning. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning, Andrew. Frank Dellaquila : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just sort of a big picture question. As you talk to your customers in the energy industry, how much -- how set are the budgets into the year? And is there anything that can change them? Is there any sort of reason to think that there could be potential upside given massively increasing economic activity, given high oil price, or do we need to wait until next year to sort of see them change their mind? Lal Karsanbhai : Good question, Andrew. I think budgets have been set on assumptions around demand and oil price. Having said that, they\u2019re significantly skewed towards sustainability efforts, they\u2019re skewed towards efficiency and operating elements of the business and that gives us a good baseline of confidence in the recovery in the market. Having said that, if we do see more planes in the air, more trucks on the road, broader economic activity, I think, we\u2019ll see expansions in the budget area as we go through the second half of the calendar year, into the second half of the calendar year and that will prove to be advantageous to the Automation business, above and beyond where we are set today. Andrew Obin : Great. And then another question on Commercial & Residential, as we think about the heat pump business in Europe. You certainly guys have been talking a lot about it. How much visibility -- it seems as part of a sort of longer-term regulatory trends, but how much visibility do have in this business over the next 12 months to 24 months? And is it accretive to the mix, neutral to the mix, how should we think about that? Thank you. Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah. Go ahead, Ram. Ram Krishnan : Yeah. I would say we have very good visibility in Europe, as well as the heat pump opportunities in China. But in Europe, our engagement with the OEMs, which play in the space, has been very good. These have been traditional customers of ours. So as it relates to the new technology that Lal referenced in terms of efficiency and sound, our scroll product line and our complete solutions position for that market, we\u2019re in deep engagement with the OEMs. So I would say the visibility is good. And then your question was margin accretive, is that -- what your question was? Andrew Obin : Yeah. Is it good for the margin or is it bad for margin? It\u2019s very simple. Ram Krishnan : It\u2019s -- I would say it\u2019s neutral to slightly accretive to the margins. Andrew Obin : Fantastic. Thank you so much. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead. Tommy Moll : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Lal Karsanbhai : Hi, Tommy. Frank Dellaquila : Hey, Tommy. Ram Krishnan : Hi, Tommy. Tommy Moll : Well, I wanted to talk about the pathway to record margins you referenced in the release and on the call. Comparing to where we were a quarter go, I\u2019m thinking through the factors that may have changed. But clearly, price/cost, even if the temporary factors worked against you in the last 90 days, so maybe flow-through on some of the cost out execution is at least as good as, maybe a little bit better than expected. But if you just step back and think about versus a quarter ago, the pathway and the timing endpoint for that record margin progression, what would you highlight for us as the most important things that have shifted? Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah. I\u2019ll say a couple of words and I\u2019ll let, Frank, who actually presented on this subject to the Board yesterday. I feel really good about the path, Tommy. We have a potential acceleration on the path in Automation Solutions with tremendous performance and on the cost. The price/cost that you referenced is predominantly in our -- the challenges are predominately in our Commercial & Residential business. But what I\u2019ll say is that they\u2019re on track to deliver that endpoint peak margins work. So I feel very, very positive. Slightly ahead in one platform, on track on the second platform. Frank? Frank Dellaquila : Yeah. Tommy, Lal summarized it well. I mean, we did have this conversation yesterday and we feel very good about the timing that we laid out in February regarding the achievement of the margin targets in 2023. The pickup in the pace of volume in Automation Solutions and the flow-through of the cost reset actions that have been taken in that business basically put us a year ahead of schedule, we believe, in terms of margin improvement there, which really derisks that plan. And in Commercial & Residential, very significant mitigation actions are being taken to offset the trench in this temporary price/cost headwind that we\u2019re going to have for the next couple, three, four quarters. And we are -- we believe strongly that we\u2019ll be right back on track to hit those targets as well. So, as Lal said, we feel very good based on the leverage that we have even in the face of the unexpected price/cost that we\u2019re going to get to the finish line in 2023 as we committed. Tommy Moll : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you, both. And if I could follow-up with a question on culture. Lal, you are now a few months in. Cultural modernization is clearly a theme that\u2019s important to you, but also one that you\u2019ve made clear is tied to value creation and execution. So what can you provide us for an update there about the vision now that you\u2019ve had a little bit of time to think through how you\u2019re going to approach it? Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah. No, I appreciate the question, Tommy. The first thing -- one of the first things we\u2019re doing in is we need to measure where we sit today and where we want to go. So we\u2019re working with an outside firm to do a cultural assessment of the 58,000 employees, salaried employees of Emerson. We\u2019ve done a pilot to understand how the tool works. We feel comfortable how - that we understand the tool and we like the tool, so we\u2019re going to broaden this out here in the month of May. And what that\u2019s going to give us is a very important set of data, understanding where we are and where the population of the company wants to go in terms of the culture. I would suggest that, in addition to that, Tommy, we\u2019ve done - taken care of some of the low-hanging fruits, some modernization of work practices. We\u2019re working with McKinsey & Company on a diversity inclusion target and goals, which we\u2019ll publish as part of the ESG report and after conversations with our Board in June. So there\u2019s a lot of activity going on. We\u2019re all a very energized about the opportunity and we do believe honestly, Tommy, at the end of the day that if we look more like the world where we live and work inside of Emerson, we\u2019ll be a better company. We\u2019ll perform at a higher rate and we\u2019ll create more value. Tommy Moll : Thank you, Lal. I\u2019ll turn it back. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Tommy. Frank Dellaquila : Thanks, Tommy. Operator : The next question will come from Markus Mittermaier with UBS. Please go ahead. Markus Mittermaier : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning. Frank Dellaquila : Good morning. Markus Mittermaier : We covered a lot of ground already, but maybe \u2013 hey, good morning. Maybe a finer question on price/cost in Com & Res, if I could. So the way understood you is that basically Q1, Q2, you were protected from essentially using inventory. So how should I read the guide to $75 million unfavorable price/cost given that sort of is that inclusive of future price trends that you might be planning? Or is that based on what you\u2019ve done so far and your best view on inflation to date? Maybe we can start there. Frank Dellaquila : So, Markus, I mean, that incremental $50 million price/cost that we\u2019ve guided to is predominantly in Commercial & Residential, obviously, factored into the guidance. And it\u2019s a complicated subject. But I mean with the major OEMs, we have material pass-through clauses, but they\u2019re all different and they all operate with varying degrees of lag. So while we\u2019re confident the price comes back in, it comes back in over time. Across the rest of the platform, we will take deliberate pricing actions and mitigation actions as well to offset that inside of the guide that we\u2019ve provided. So that\u2019s how we think about it and that\u2019s how it will play out. That\u2019s how it\u2019s played out historically. This is just a more pronounced increase than we\u2019ve seen in anybody\u2019s memory here. Markus Mittermaier : Okay. Got it. And then maybe a broader question on China, obviously, easy comps in the past quarter here. How do you see the momentum in both short- and long-cycle there on the ground? Maybe you could take us on a tour through the various verdicts to stay on China, specifically given that is quite sizable for you guys? Thank you. Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Markus. I feel good about what\u2019s we\u2019re seeing in China. Obviously, the past quarter was very, very strong across all platforms. We\u2019re seeing good activity on the Automation side, KOB3-driven, but also project-driven, particularly in the Chemicals segment, which is - should continue through the second half of the year. And then the easier comps obviously come on the climate side, but again, encouraging trends there as well, infrastructure, commercial construction-driven and cold chain around transport, particularly. So I feel really good about China for the remainder of the year. Teams are very engaged and I feel positive about what we\u2019ll see throughout the fiscal. Operator : The next question will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Reive : Hi. Good morning. This is Jeffrey Reive on for Deane. My question is I think in your prior guidance baked in WTI prices of $45 a barrel to $55 a barrel. So I think we\u2019re sitting above that level pretty comfortably now. Maybe how has that changed your thinking? How has that factored into the new guidance? And maybe what are you hearing from customers? Frank Dellaquila : Yeah. Thanks, Jeffrey. Yeah, obviously, it\u2019s embedded in our thinking and that level of activity that we\u2019ve baked into Automation Solutions and the increase in the guidance there. We\u2019re seeing that being reflected in the spend rate and the activity in the segment more closer to that $60 number now. But as you can imagine, customers are still relatively skittish as they forecast and we talked about budgets in the past in one of the past questions here. So they\u2019re watching it closely. But clearly, as reflected in the increased guidance, I feel a little bit stronger about where the WTI ultimately will land for the year. Jeffrey Reive : Got it. Thanks. And then maybe just another one, can you talk about the Chairman transition? Was it a conscious decision to separate the Chairman role from the CEO role? And maybe you have any update on the timing of a potential CFO transition? Lal Karsanbhai : Well, you know Jeffrey, the CFO is sitting right here with me. I\u2019m very happy that he\u2019s here with me and... Frank Dellaquila : Did Deane tell you to ask that? Lal Karsanbhai : No CFO transition in the foreseeable future here. I\u2019m very happy that I have Frank and very blessed to have Frank, very honestly, and his experience, which will be incredibly important for this management team. So nothing there to report. In terms of the Chairman, honestly, it was not -- it was highly researched, debated and discussed with the Board. Obviously, felt very comfortable with the separation of role to enable me to operate the company, to learn the governance piece over time, to have mentorship from the Board of Directors, very important. And again, as you think about the early stages of my CEO-ship, so that was the right decision. I\u2019m glad the Board supported it and I think we landed in a really good place. Jeffrey Reive : Very helpful. Thanks a lot. Lal Karsanbhai : Frank, your retirement... Operator : The next question will come from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. Frank, I\u2019m still very happy you\u2019re around, so. Frank Dellaquila : Thank you, Andy. I appreciate that. Andy Kaplowitz : All right. So last quarter in C&RS (sic) [CR&S], I think, you were still wondering how your Q4 would look, given tougher comparisons in residential on how the professional tools recovery would shake out. Obviously, you\u2019ve refined your guide for second half revenue growth and you sound good about your visibility in Q4 at this stage. But could you give us more color into how you were thinking about the Q4 growth against the more difficult comps and how that might translate into FY 2022 growth and the longer-term revenue growth guidance that you gave at the Analyst Day for C&RS (sic) [CR&S] of 5% to 7%? Lal Karsanbhai : I\u2019ll comment on it. I will \u2013 I feel good because of the cross section in the cycles, right? The early cycle residential, I think, we\u2019ll all agree is going to taper off whether that tapers in Q4 or into Q1, but it will taper off, it\u2019s been incredibly hot now for a number of quarters. But the good news is the balance that that platform has, in terms of not just in the climate side with cold chain, which is accelerating, as we\u2019ll go into Q3 and Q4, but also on the professional tools side, which will balance off the consumer tool businesses, which have benefited from do-it-yourself and big star growth. So the balance is incredibly strong. It gives me, at this point, at least confidence heading into the latter half of this year and honestly into a balanced perspective into 2022. Andy Kaplowitz : That\u2019s helpful, Lal. And I\u2019m sure you guys don\u2019t want to update us in the funnel every quarter. But let me ask you about in the sense, so you had mentioned $6.5 billion in your funnel that you had mentioned $1.6 billion for electrification funnel. So maybe it\u2019s a good time to talk to us about an update on OSI. But also in terms of the funnel, obviously, KOB1 actually perking up a little bit. Are you seeing new projects enter the funnel? Or is it really some of these old projects maybe starting to move a little bit? Lal Karsanbhai : A little bit of both. Obviously, the two feed stages on Baltic and Golden Island are things have been talked about and debated and discussed for a long time, and so those are starting to move forward, so that\u2019s that element. But something like the Sempra is, obviously, in terms of - it\u2019s relatively new. We didn\u2019t know whether it was going to move forward as part of that significant eighth job LNG wave. Now this is the ninth job. So very important to see that. In terms of what\u2019s new in the funnel, it\u2019s still in that $6.4 billion range. The hydrogen-related element, in addition to that, would be about $1 billion. The electrification piece, as you said about $1.5, $1.6. There\u2019s some newer stuff in there, but it\u2019s relatively smaller. Biofuels conversions of existing facilities are modernizations that fall into the funnel. So it\u2019s relatively static, although it is encouraging as you point out to see some things moving to the left. Now, in terms of OSI, phenomenal first six months with us ahead of plan that we put together internally and to -- and present it to our Board. I feel great about the management team and what they\u2019re accomplishing. And more interestingly, I feel really good about the opportunity to continue to invest in the business and expand the sandbox. I think it\u2019s a very unique opportunity for us in terms of both technology and end market diversification. We want to do both, but we want to do more, both organically and if available inorganically. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate it, guys. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks. Operator : The next question will come from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead. Lal Karsanbhai : Hey, Gautam. How are you doing? Gautam Khanna : Hey, thank you very much. Lal Karsanbhai : Gautam, you\u2019re not the only one who gets your name\u2026 Gautam Khanna : Thank you. Lal Karsanbhai : You\u2019re not the only one who gets your name massacred. I\u2019m there with you. Gautam Khanna : No. Not at all. Yeah. I know we understand each other. I still remember being called Quantum when I was in Little League Baseball. Yeah. Lal Karsanbhai : Gosh. Gautam Khanna : So, hey, a couple of questions. First, in the quarter, what was the mix of KOB3 at Auto Sol and what are you guys expecting in the second half with respect to KOB3 versus the other two? Lal Karsanbhai : So, first, second quarter first half stayed relatively consistent at 59% on KOB3. And very honestly, I expect that to stay within that 59% to 60% range as we go through the second half of the year. It\u2019s a very strong mix, obviously, for us. But that\u2019s kind of where I see it, Gautam, as we go through the second half. Gautam Khanna : Okay. And in your opening remarks you talked about turnaround backlog being pretty strong, visibility there being strong. Anything you\u2019re seeing with respect to scope of turnaround that\u2019s different than you would normally see in a cyclical recovery? Any sort of change in customer buying behavior that\u2019s noteworthy? Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah. No. Interestingly enough. So what we saw particularly in the upgrade turnaround environment as we went through COVID, was that the systems upgrades for the most part continued. And the reason they continued is because of the ability to perform a lot of that work virtually and remotely. We have tremendous capabilities in our DeltaV business to do that, in our Ovation business to do that. And that activity continued as system upgrades were performed around the world. What was mostly impacted was the stuff that hangs on pipes or on vessels, the valves, the transmitters, the flow equipment and which we\u2019re now seeing the acceleration. And honestly, there is just no two ways to do that remotely. You\u2019ve got have people on-site and you\u2019ve got to have a lot of people that are not necessarily familiar with your site there. What we\u2019re seeing and we\u2019ll watch whether this is a trend or not, there are two things, Gautam, to your question. Number one, the scale of the turnaround, they may be doing one or two units versus the entire facility. And secondly, the rate or the cycle at which the turnarounds are performed, many of these facilities have now gone over 18 months, almost 24 months, without a turnaround. They may question, whether they can expand the cycle on turnaround and the frequency at turnarounds based on this experience. We haven\u2019t necessarily gotten that message yet, but we\u2019re watching it very carefully as we go through this cycle, particularly this season over the summer into the fall. Hey, Ram, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve got comments there. Ram Krishnan : No. Lal Karsanbhai : Okay. Gautam Khanna : Thank you. Very helpful. Ram Krishnan : Yeah. Sure. Lal Karsanbhai : Okay. Well, I want to thank everyone for your questions and your engagement today. It was a -- I felt phenomenal about my first quarter as CEO. I thank the teams, a lot of hard work and a lot of energy. And I feel really good about the momentum that we have as an organization for the second half of the year and into 2022. So thank you, everyone, for your time and talk soon. Frank Dellaquila : Thank you. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Pete Lilly, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Pete Lilly : Thank you so much. Good morning, everyone, and thank you again for joining us for Emerson\u2019s third quarter earnings and conference call. Today, I\u2019m joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; Chief Financial Officer, Frank Dellaquila; and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan. I\u2019d also like to introduce and welcome, the new leader of Emerson Investor Relations, and certainly an upgrade for the role, Colleen Mettler. Colleen joins us from the Automation Solutions finance organization, and will be your main point of contact going forward, as I try to transition to a new role in the operating business units. Many thanks to you all for your support and friendship over the past couple of years. It\u2019s been fun. I certainly wish you health and success. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the accompanying slide presentation, which is available on our website. Please join me on Slide 2. As always, this presentation may include forward-looking statements, which contain a degree of business risk and uncertainty. Please turn to Slide 3. And I will turn the call over to Colleen to introduce herself and cover some exciting developments within Emerson. Colleen Mettler : Thanks, Pete. I certainly have big shoes to fill. As Pete mentioned, I\u2019m coming into this role from our Automation Solutions finance organization, and I\u2019ve been with Emerson for over 13 years. I\u2019m certainly excited and humbled to be joining the Investor Relations team during this dynamic time for our organization. I look forward to speaking with all our investors and partners very soon. Now, I would like to take a moment to highlight two areas of real ESG impact within Emerson. First, on Slide 3, and keeping with environmental sustainability framework of greening of, by, and with Emerson that we introduced in February, our first topic is about Greening by Emerson. It is a great example of how Emerson solutions are relevant in enabling our customers\u2019 sustainability initiatives. Emerson recently signed a multi-year agreement with PureCycle Technologies, which has a novel technology and process for fully recycling plastic number 5, polypropylene back to a clear pellet. As some of you may know, polypropylene is a common form of plastic that has not had great recycling options. Emerson is serving as their born digital automation partner going forward with initial plant project in Ohio, Georgia and a remote operations center in Florida. Now, please join me on Slide #4. Our second topic is a Greening with Emerson example. Leveraging our Helix Innovation Center in Dayton, Ohio, Emerson has collaborated with the Department of Energy and their Oak Ridge National Laboratory to advance next-generation HVACR technology, expanding the applicability of heat pump technology, redesigning refrigeration architectures to maximize efficiency and food retail, and working to minimize energy used and leaked in commercial HVAC applications are just a few of the exciting areas of cooperation. We have a number of collaborations with the Department of Energy and their lab. We look forward to continuing to build these relationships and support the development of novel solutions and real sustainability roadmap going forward. Now, please turn to Slide 5, and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Lal Karsanbhai. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Colleen. Just a few words before I turn it over to Frank to go through the financial data. First, Pete, thank you very much, Godspeed and have a good luck in your new opportunity. We\u2019re all very excited for you and thanks for all of the hard work. Welcome, Colleen. It\u2019s great to have you here. Colleen and I\u2019ve had the opportunity to spend a couple of years together in Automation Solutions, and we\u2019re very blessed to have her join our Investor Relations team. Colleen Mettler : Thank you. Lal Karsanbhai : So, welcome. Thank you. I\u2019d like to express my thanks to the leadership teams and the management and our employees globally for what has been a very, very well-executed quarter. And we have a lot of energy and momentum behind us, which was very exciting to see as we executed through the last three months. I\u2019d also like to express my thank you to our shareholders. I had the opportunity over the last six months to meet many of you, and I look forward to meeting more of you, as I go through the next part of the year. But I appreciate your continued confidence, your challenges and, of course, your investments. A few things, just -- that are non-financially related that I wanted to mention to the team here. First of all, our cultural work is well underway. We will be announcing our new Chief People Officer later this month. We\u2019re all very excited about the selection process. It will be an outside hire and somebody who fundamentally will have the opportunity to come in here and really help us, as we navigate some of the challenges and create a many of the pathways that we have as we evolve the culture of Emerson into the future. Secondly, our portfolio work is complete. We have \u2013 we are now -- we\u2019re getting ready to review it with the Board, which will occur at the October Board Meeting. We discussed briefly with the Board yesterday. And essentially, what we have defined is multiple paths for our business to drive higher underlying sales growth and diversification of the portfolio. We\u2019re all very excited about the process we underwent. It was very exhaustive. And we have turned over a lot of different spells, defining broad markets with high-growth and loss of optionality in terms of M&A and organic activity, very exciting there. I\u2019ll mention on the M&A front that industrial software continues to be critical, as we think about share of wallet and we think about the potential for underlying growth acceleration. And there are many pathways there. Our OSI acquisition is performing incredibly well and ahead of our internal synergy board plans. So, that\u2019s been very, very well done. But what stands out to me most above all is the execution by the team. Yes, there were market tailwinds, and we\u2019ll talk about those, particularly as they accelerated in Automation Solutions and continued across our commercial residential businesses. And they are relevant, but the execution was absolutely phenomenal. There were a lot of hurdles to overcome through the quarter, material inflation, material availability. We did a lot of expediting. We had to get very creative in qualifying suppliers, logistics and management of cargo around the world, and, of course, labor availability in the United States. But the team just did a great job. And lastly, before I turn it over to Frank, the cost reset work is well underway and we\u2019re now in the tail end of the span. And we\u2019re seeing, despite these operational headwinds, the value of that work being reflected in the incrementals of the Company. The operating leverage -- profit leverage at 34% was very strong, and now, most importantly, has given us the room to accelerate investment in differentiating technologies. And further -- that will further, I think, drive relevance -- increased relevance at our customer base. So very exciting headroom that\u2019s created and we started those investments. And I\u2019ll share a number of those with you and we\u2019ll talk about that more as we go through the year. So, with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Frank. And I\u2019ll speak towards the end of the call. Frank Dellaquila : All right. Thank you, Lal. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us. We\u2019re especially pleased with the results in the quarter, especially in light of the operations challenges that Lal just described, and Ram will talk about them later in the call.  If you please go to Slide 6. So, continued recovery in our end markets, combined with the benefits of the cost reset actions, and it drove strong operating performance and financial results in the third quarter. Adjusted EPS was $1.09, up 36% from the prior year. Demand continues to strengthen the sales coming in ahead of our expectations with underlying growth of 15% and June trailing three-month orders were at 26%. Automation Solutions notably turned positive this quarter in both sales and orders, up 9% in sales and 17% on an underlying basis. Commercial & Residential Solutions continues to experience robust demand across the business and geographies with 29% sales growth and 43% orders growth on an underlying basis. The cost reset benefits continued to be realized as planned, reading through to the margins. And along with the additional volume and leverage, they drove adjusted segment EBIT growth of 40%, 280 basis points of increased margin to 19.6%. Cash flow continues to be very strong with operating and free cash flow approximately 30% year-over-year and free cash flow conversion exceeding 150% of net earnings. We\u2019re continuing to implement the remaining elements of the cost reset program. In this quarter, we initiated $32 million of restructuring actions. The program is on schedule and delivering the projected savings, as we planned.  Please turn to Slide 7. There\u2019s a bridge of the earnings per share increase from prior year. The operational performance was very strong. So, the noteworthy thing on this chart is the green bar. Operations added 33% to adjusted EPS, and it was balanced between the platforms. They both delivered strong profit leverage on the strength of volume increases and cost reduction benefits, as Ram mentioned, while leverage was 34% across the enterprise. Tax, currency, pension stock comp netted to a $0.05 headwind, and there was a minor favorable impact from share purchase. Again, in total, adjusted EPS was a $1.09, up 36%. Please go to the next chart, chart number 8. So, as I mentioned, underlying sales is up 15%. Gross profit increased 90 basis points to 42.4%, driven mainly by the benefits of the cost reduction actions and then the leverage on the volume across the enterprise. We did offset the impact of price cost headwinds, which we are beginning to see intensify and which we will see in the next couple of quarters, and we will talk about a little later in the call. Adjusted EBIT margin was 18.4%, up 310 basis points. Effective tax rate was 19.2% versus 11% in the prior year. Last year, we had several favorable discrete items, mostly around R&D credits that we described at the time. This was a $0.10 headwind year-over-year that we overcame. Adjusted EPS, as mentioned, was $1.09 versus $0.80, last year. If you go to Slide 9, please, we\u2019ll talk about earnings and cash flow. Adjusted segment EBIT again increased 40%, margin up 280 basis points. Leverage on volume and cost reset benefits offset material cost headwinds in the Climate Technologies business. Adjusted pretax earnings increased 350 basis points to 17.6%. Operating cash flow was very strong, up 31% at $1.1 billion. Free cash flow was $977 million, also up a little over 30%, driven by strong earnings growth and effective working capital management. Lastly, the trade working capital ratio improved to 15.4% of sales. Turning to Slide 10, we\u2019ll look at Automation Solutions. Underlying sales turned positive this quarter at 8%. Trailing three-month orders accelerated to 17%. The improvement in the Americas is particularly encouraging and notable with continued momentum in life sciences, food and beverage and medical markets and a return to growth more broadly across the traditional process automation markets and sustainability-related business. We\u2019re seeing increasing KOB3 activity across our process automation customer base, mainly driven by shutdown turnaround and outage activity and OpEx spend. MRO spend is returning to pre-pandemic levels from pent-up demand and delayed STLs. CapEx spending is recovering at a slower rate with tailwinds from site-based emissions and optimization projects. The platform continues to implement the comprehensive restructuring actions that have been ongoing, and the benefits are flowing through to the financial results. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 320 basis points and 310 basis points at adjusted EBITDA, driven mainly by the flow-through of the cost reset savings and by the volume leverage. The integration of OSI continues to go very well. We\u2019re very pleased with the acquisition and the results to date, and we have increasing confidence in the synergy plan that we have. Backlog increased to $5.5 billion. It is up 17% year-to-date. We\u2019ll talk a bit about the project funnel and other opportunities later in the call. Turning to Slide 11, we\u2019ll review Commercial & Residential Solutions. Sales were up on an underlying basis, 29% versus the prior year. Orders continue to be strong and very broad-based in their strength. The June trailing three-month underlying orders were up 43%, and it was very balanced across both, Climate Technologies and tools and home products. All our businesses and geographies showed strong double-digit growth. Residential markets continue to be strong and growth has accelerated in cold chain and professional tools. The Americas were up 29% with continued strength across all end markets. Europe was up 37%, driven by continued heat pump demand and increasing sales of professional tools. Asia, Middle East and Africa was up 25%, driven by cold chain and various heating technologies. Margins improved by 170 basis points of adjusted EBIT and 120 basis points of adjusted EBITDA, driven by the strong volume leverage and the cost reset savings, which more than offset the price cost headwinds that we are seeing in the business. Please turn to Slide 12. I\u2019m going to pass this over to Ram. And he\u2019s going to talk a bit about operations, what we\u2019ve done in the quarter to deliver the results and some of the challenges that we face. Ram Krishnan : Thanks, Frank. Clearly, as you can see, our operating environment remains very challenging as commodity inflation, electronic supply and labor availability continues to impact our global operations. Steel prices are at record highs with 11 months of consecutive increases and, in our estimation, have not peaked yet. Plastic resin prices remain elevated as our global teams have maneuvered expeditiously defined alternatives to maintain supply. And while copper pricing has receded off record highs, it is still up over $1.40 a pound year-over-year. Our hedge positions lessened the impact to 2021, but the inflation impact in terms of copper will carry over into most of 2022. Electronic shortages are proliferating in most of our businesses, impacting both platforms, and supply is expected to remain constrained well into 2022. Very little component inventory on microprocessors, controllers, linear integrated circuits are available in the open market, and the number of shortages faced by our EMS suppliers is growing, severely impacting lead times. And finally, labor availability continues to be an issue across many industries in the U.S., and our businesses are impacted as well. Our V-shaped demand recovery in many of our Commercial & Residential Solutions businesses, local competition driven by tight labor markets in many cities, and rolling labor constraints as waves of COVID disruptions impact our sites, has added a new level of complexity to our operational plans. It is important to note that price cost remains at an unfavorable $75 million as we estimated last quarter. No change, but we expect the maximum impact of the commodity inflation to be felt in the next two quarters. Now, despite these challenges, turning to Slide 13, I\u2019d like to highlight some of the outstanding work by our global supply chain and operations teams to combat these challenges and help deliver phenomenal operational results to date as they remain flexible, creative and nimble in a dynamic environment to serve the needs of our customers. Our supply chain teams have worked tirelessly in this environment to ensure continuity of material supply to our global plants. As you can see on the chart, many creative solutions are being implemented on a real-time basis, quickly and effectively. Our regional footprint, both on the manufacturing side as well as supply chain that we spent many years developing, has certainly been an advantage for us in these challenging times. Many of our global plants are producing at record levels while ramping up capacity to meet surging demand and, in many cases, in-sourcing critical elements of the supply chain to address sudden disruptions. I do want to take this opportunity to sincerely thank our global teams for delivering an outstanding operational quarter. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Lal to walk through our full year guidance and outlook. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Ram. Let\u2019s turn now to Slide 15. We are improving our sales outlook for the year, based on the continued strength in our orders, the pace of business and the year-to-date profit performance. We now expect underlying sales growth to be near the top of our May guidance of approximately 5% to 6%, Commercial Residential above their range in May at 15% to 16%, and Automation Solutions closer to the top of their range at 0% to 1%. The strong volume and improved cost base will flow through to margins. Our estimates are now 50 basis points above the previous guidance, increasing adjusted EBIT margin and adjusted EBITDA by 0.5% to approximately 18% and 23%, respectively. There\u2019s no change to the restructuring, tax rate, capital spend or dividend. Strong profitability and working capital performance enabled an increase in our operating cash flow and free cash flow estimates, both of which increased by $300 million. We are also raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $4.07, plus or minus $0.01. Our price/cost headwind for 2021 currently remains as estimated in Q2 and Ram covered at $75 million, despite the current challenges that were highlighted. We continue to manage this through containment, selective price actions, but the recent market developments that Ram described will be a challenge through the next two quarters, as we navigate them. Stock compensation impact increases to $125 million. So, now, we\u2019ll go over to chart 16, and I\u2019ll just frame the order environment that we\u2019ve experienced through the last three months. Emerson\u2019s trailing three-month orders continue to be very strong and have momentum from the last update we gave you in the second quarter, with Commercial & Residential Solutions continuing to climb higher in their order run rates and Automation Solutions turned sharply positive to the high-teens in June. Commercial & Residential Solutions continues to see strength in residential, cold chain and the professional tools business, and all three very near to that average band of 43%. Discrete and hybrid markets in Automation Solutions continue to be very strong, while we see recovery in later cycle process automation markets, especially in North America. KOB3 and KOB2 are driving most of the recovery, but we are beginning to see some KOB1 activity materialize, particularly in chemicals, power and biofuels. The Americas really strengthened, up 29% as deferred maintenance demand and site access drove momentum. Finally, as we have commented in the past quarters, life sciences momentum continues to be extremely strong. Let\u2019s now turn to chart 17, and I\u2019ll review the underlying sales growth outlook. Q3 underlying sales were up 15% versus prior year, exceeding our management expectations, driven by the strength in Commercial & Residential Solutions as well as the North America recovery just discussed. Full year expectations on underlying sales are between 5% and 6%, at the top end of our prior guidance of 3% to 6% and sales of approximately $18.4 billion. The fourth quarter is expected to land in the high single digits to low double-digit range. For the remainder of the year, we expect to see the North America business continue to recover in Automation Solutions as well as continued broad strength in commercial residential solutions. However, the impact of supply chain and labor issues will be a challenge. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 18, and I\u2019ll review our outlook by geography. As Frank mentioned, for the full year, we are expecting Automation Solutions sales to be flat to 1% and Commercial & Residential Solutions to be between 15% and 16%, driving us to our overall 5% to 6% underlying sales expectations. So, starting off in the Americas. Quarter four is expected to be strong in Automation Solutions at approximately 20% growth, broad-based recovery across all industries, led by continued strength in discrete and increasing strength in hybrid. Process is showing some recovery, although uneven with some strength from returning domestic oil demand, offset by reduced midstream investment and continued fiscal restraint in upstream. For KOB3, we expect to see continued spend for deferred maintenance and increasing spend for site access that has been pent-up from the pandemic with an expectation that we will see a strong fall shutdown turnaround season. In Latin America, strength in mining industries, particularly, are expected to continue. On the Commercial & Residential side of the business, ongoing momentum in the residential markets, driven by do-it-yourself trends, home starts and HVAC seasonality as well as strength in professional tools and cold chain are expected to continue. Europe will continue to see demand in life sciences and biofuels on the automation side. Project wins in power, midstream, downstream and sustainability will drive low to mid-single-digit growth in Q4. Commercial & Residential will see robust demand for heat pumps and professional tools as well as the continuation of the refrigeration market recovery in Q4. Turning to Asia, Middle East and Africa. Our Asia automation business is seeing healthy project activity in marine, nuclear, life sciences and semiconductors and a positive trend for site level spending in the Middle East. On the Commercial & Residential side, we are seeing the commercial recovery across the region, specifically with commercial AC and cold chain solutions. Ongoing COVID restrictions continue to be a challenge across the organization, particularly in this part of the world. Let\u2019s now turn to chart 19, and we\u2019ll review the business funnel for Automation Solutions. So, back in February, we commented that our traditional large project funnel was $6.4 billion, and this should be something that is very familiar to those of you who watch this carefully. Since February, we have booked approximately $80 million of projects, some LNG and one most notably in Mexico. New projects added include clean fuels, hydrogen, renewable diesels, lithium mining and LNG projects, while projects removed from the funnel since February were mostly oil and gas and downstream refining projects. The August 2021 funnel is now valued at $6.3 billion and approximately 180 projects. And below in the donut pies, you can see the industry mix of our traditional funnel. We have identified new decarbonization opportunities. And though generally smaller than our traditional definition of projects for our funnel classifications, these projects are increasingly relevant to our business. They\u2019re being added into this view so that -- because they have the potential to grow in nature over time. Today, as depicted on the chart, these opportunities are worth $400 million and approximately 120 projects. The combination of our traditional project funnel and the new sustainability funnel is now valued at $6.7 billion. And below is the combined industry mix where we are working to diversify our funnel. On the right side of the chart, we are introducing the business opportunities with our recent OSI acquisition, which gave us an important foothold into the transmission and distribution automation space. These opportunities have slightly different characteristics from our traditional project funnel definition, and therefore, we are keeping it separate for our discussion purposes today. Generally, these opportunities are smaller and more numerous compared to our large traditional project funnel, but they are clearly strategically important. The value of these opportunities is $1.5 billion and are made up of 530 projects. To give you some perspective on the scale and how differentiated it is, approximately 15% of that $1.5 billion has a value of greater than $5 million, and 50% of it is between $1 million and $5 million. The funnel is global, although approximately $1 billion of it is in North America and Europe. Overall, we have strong opportunities ahead, and I\u2019m bullish on overall project outlook as we diversify and expand into new spaces. Now, let\u2019s turn to chart 20. This is a very important chart. And as Frank mentioned in our financial results showcase, our robust cost reset plan is being incredibly well executed across the enterprise. As a reminder, this comprehensive plan began in late 2019 and will be fully realized by 2023. It involves over $600 million in spend and approximately $650 million in savings. In February, we also introduced our midrange targets of 24% adjusted EBITDA margins and $4.75 to $5 in adjusted EPS. We are very much on track to reach those targets by 2023. Importantly, however, the recent outperformance and momentum through the end of 2021 is creating some headroom for critical investments, and I\u2019m particularly excited about this, particularly as I think about key technologies that will enable our business to outperform over the long term. As you can see, revenues, margins and cash flow are all better than February expectations and are enabling this acceleration in technology investments. I\u2019ve outlined four examples below and we\u2019ll come out over the next months and in depth in February as to how we\u2019re managing and thinking about these very significant investments. Those examples outlined are the Copeland K7 scroll, which is the largest new product investment in the history of our air conditioning business. This thing drives obviously increased performance and meets the 2023 efficiency regulations and is optimized for 2025 refrigerants. The Greenlee remote cutters, an award-winning tool on the right hand side of the chart, which enhances safety for cutting underground cables. The Gemini, which has our next-generation pressure in temperature device being developed in our measurement solutions business, which will have next-generation electronics, unmatched safety and process insight. And lastly, our Plantweb Optics, our integrated operational performance platform, which unifies data, people and systems to drive operational performance. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator, and we\u2019ll begin the Q&A. Thank you. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning, and I look forward to working with you, Colleen. In terms of, I suppose, Lal, the Automation Solutions sort of revenue outlook. So, a lot of very good color in the slides. It looks like the guidance is embedding sort of mid-single-digit type growth in the fourth quarter in Auto Sol organically. When we take your comments together in terms of a sort of stable funnel since February and maybe an ongoing sort of subdued oil and gas CapEx backdrop, should we take that as a good sort of medium term or into next 12 months sort of placeholder that mid-single-digit type Auto Sol growth rate? Lal Karsanbhai : Hi. Good morning, Julian. Thank you. Thanks for the question. I think that\u2019s fair. Look, the recovery has been largely fueled by modernizations and MRO spend across facilities. There has been, as I indicated, some KOB1, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s going to drive us going forward. So, what I would expect is, I think, that conversion in -- of those two segments of the business into -- from orders into sales would continue. And I think the guidance is -- I think that\u2019s a fair assumption. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. And then, maybe switching to the margin aspect, maybe clarify how much of that $75 million price-cost headwind sort of falls into the fourth quarter. And when we look at Com Res margins in that context, can that business sustain a sort of 20-plus percent incremental margin the next six months, or does it get sort of pushed below that by the price-cost headwinds? Lal Karsanbhai : Great question as well, Julian. Clearly, that\u2019s where the challenge is going to be is on incrementals in Commercial Residential for the next six months. The team is working both sides of the equation, Julian, price and cost. We\u2019re getting very creative in terms of the contract structures and the negotiations with our major customers. But we also have opportunities to continue to work availability of materials, sourcing from different world areas, moving a few things around. But that\u2019s where the biggest challenge is, and I would suggest that your assertion is correct that the incrementals in that business are going to be the most challenged as we go over the next six months. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Wow, I got nailed there, Josh. A couple of questions. I guess, first on some of the kind of extra funnel additions, particularly on decarbonization, nice to see that tick up. I guess, can we add some more context there, if you wouldn\u2019t mind. I mean on one hand, your customers have -- some of your legacy customers are pretty big emitters. Is there more of a push on those folks to sort of diagnose, measure and improve, or is more of the funnel that you\u2019re tracking sort of on more green technologies, like you mentioned hydrogen? Like, which one of those is showing up more and which one do you think could be kind of the bigger needle mover here in the medium-term? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, great question. And I think there\u2019s a little bit of both in the funnel. I think if you look at the traditional $6.3 billion funnel, there was already embedded in that a lot of the biofuel conversions, emissions monitoring work that\u2019s being done downstream, particularly in refining and other parts. What\u2019s in the green bar, what\u2019s in the new opportunities, I think, are significantly incremental investments. And those are partially driven by things like green diesels, which is basically the manufacturing of diesel, but using a feedstock that is a sustainable feedstock or the investments in hydrogen. If you recall, back in February, we talked about $1 billion opportunity for hydrogen that was framed around 2030. However, as we now bring these projects into our -- and this is a very defined pursuit process that we run within the business. We now bring those into that pursuit, and we are pursuing those to 2023, and that\u2019s the view of the $400 million. I expect that to increase over time and the number -- not just the number, but the scale of those projects to become more and more meaningful, which is why we\u2019re talking about it today. But you\u2019re absolutely right. I think, our core integrated oil customers, upstream through the midstream and downstream, they\u2019re all spending dollars, incremental dollars on emissions, sustainability, reliability, productivity, all around those automations to drive to their ESG commitments. And that can come in the frame of conversions or of optimizing current processes. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And just on the price-cost side, I know some of what you guys have out there, particularly in Com Res has kind of pricing contracts that we set periodically, maybe annually. I would imagine that that puts you a bit more behind the curve this year. Can you maybe talk about what just slipping the calendar or flipping the fiscal year sort of sets up in terms of price cost? I know Ram talked about some of the hedges, postponing things like copper inflation. But I think there\u2019s probably a little pent-up pricing opportunity as well. Could you maybe kind of match up how those things work together? Ram Krishnan : Yes. So, I\u2019ll take that. From a pricing perspective, as Lal mentioned, our Commercial & Residential teams are working that diligently. Many of the pricing, particularly with the large OEMs, some will happen in October, but many of it will happen in the Jan time frame. So, you\u2019ll expect the pricing to kick in, in a big way into our second quarter. And that\u2019s all well underway. In terms of the steel and copper pricing, certainly, the copper hedges will flow through, through the year. We\u2019ve modeled that out. On the steel side, we do expect the next three to six months to be pretty tough. But outside of that, going into the second quarter, we\u2019ll start seeing the better pricing on steel come through as well. So, I would say, from a pricing perspective, a lot of the pricing from our perspective is modeled in the Jan time-frame. Josh Pokrzywinski : Okay. So, after that six-month timeframe, it is a bigger step-up. Understood. I appreciate it. Thanks for the color, both. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Hey, guys. Good morning. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning, Andrew. Frank Dellaquila : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Hey, I just was wondering if you can talk about sort of internal bottlenecks, and specifically I\u2019m thinking Com Res. It seems resi HVAC is doing very well. You\u2019re talking about V-shaped recovery in tools. Do you need to add capacity at Copeland and tools to deal with demand? And how are you thinking about it? Ram Krishnan : Yes. We are clearly in a position where we are adding capacity and will add more capacity as we go through this plan. Certainly, at this point, we\u2019re fighting labor challenges in terms of short-term capacity in many of our current U.S. locations, but we are adding capacity, both in the U.S. as well as Mexico for both the Climate Technologies business as well as the tools business. So, the answer is yes. Andrew Obin : Excellent. But it\u2019s not a constraint, right? How much of a constraint is it to growth, I guess? Ram Krishnan : It is not a constraint at current levels, I mean, outside of the labor challenges we see. But, as we model out the long-term growth dynamics of the business and certainly, the regulation changes that are coming down the pipe, it\u2019s important for our longer-term plans. Andrew Obin : Got you. And just a follow-up question. I think, you disclosed systems and software now. Can you just break down how much -- what is organic growth? And I mean, clearly, the balance would be M&A. And also specifically hone in on growth trends that you\u2019re seeing in OSI Power, the funnel is very impressive there. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. So, as we -- Frank and I mentioned in the comments, Andrew, we\u2019re very pleased with the performance of OSI Power. We were actually up there for a growth planning session just earlier -- late July. So, the teams are performing incredibly well. Management, we\u2019ve retained management, and they\u2019re executing the plans. And what we\u2019re seeing is actually higher-than-expected ability to leverage existing relationships that PWS and Ovation have across the large power companies in North America. But, more importantly, the opportunity to greatly geographically expand this business at a far higher rate than we expected at the time of the acquisition. So, validating the technology, validating the applicability and the customer relevance has been very important for us. So, we\u2019re excited. There is an opportunity to build around this business, and there is a vision to continue to transform this into more of a pure software play in terms of evolution from perpetual into subscription, in terms of outsourcing services and focusing on software and looking around measures that are relevant for software businesses, such as annual recurring revenues and things of that sort. So, we\u2019re working that very aggressively within the business. In terms of growth rates, I would suggest high single digits on the Systems & Solutions business. And I would say, Jeff, that the data management layer grew slightly above that, but on average. But, I don\u2019t have that number in front of me. But that would be based on what I have seen and heard, my understanding, Andrew. Operator : The next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Thanks for all the transparency on your thought process here about a strategic review and everything. But, it is interesting, I guess, you say that you\u2019ve concluded it, and you will review it with the Board in October. So, I suppose that suggests any idea of any large-scale strategic change or something like that is not on the Board or you wouldn\u2019t be sitting on that until October. And instead, we should think about you\u2019re cultivating a investment pipeline and kind of an M&A pipeline and, as you said, kind of looking at ways to create new growth vectors and potentially diversify a bit. Is that the right read on what you said in your opening remarks? Lal Karsanbhai : It\u2019s an interesting read, Jeff. I\u2019ll tell you this. The M&A pipeline is ever green. We\u2019re working a number of opportunities as we speak, which are related to and aligned with the strategic portfolio study that we\u2019ve done. So, we\u2019re very excited about those, and we\u2019ve been speaking to the Board about those opportunities through the summer and will continue to do so through this month because some may come sooner rather than later. That\u2019s okay. Now, in terms of the overall study, look, this management team believes that the path to the higher multiple and to the total shareholder return performance is driving an increase in the underlying sales growth of the Company. And we need to fall into this bucket of 4% to 6%. So, as we look at our optionality around the makeup -- the current makeup of the portfolio and the potential to invest in new areas, that\u2019s really what the study and the portfolio study focused on. And those are really where the engagements and debates with the Board will take place. But we\u2019re walking and chewing gum at the same time. We haven\u2019t stopped pursuing opportunities as a management team and as a Board, simply because we haven\u2019t covered the details of the study with the Board, but they\u2019re very much aware of it. Jeff Sprague : Understood. Thank you. And then, just thinking about the investments, right, it would seem like you\u2019re certainly on a pretty good glide path that kind of hit or beat those 2023 targets. But, it sounds like you are cautioning us a little bit that the investment spending and the bias to make sure there\u2019s growth kind of beyond 2023 potentially tempers the upside of those targets. Is that kind of a correct perspective? Lal Karsanbhai : No. Honestly, glide path is generous. There\u2019s a lot of hard work to hit those targets, Jeff, by everyone engaged. And there are always obstacles in the way as we\u2019re experiencing -- as we have experienced this quarter with labor and materials, as Ram and Frank described. So, it\u2019s a lot of hard work to get there, and we\u2019re not taking our eye off the ball. Having said that, not only do we need to work the portfolio opportunities that I just mentioned with pluses and minuses, but we need to elevate the organic investments and the organic sales growth of the Company. And with that, we have to take -- we have to make those investments for the future. So, it\u2019s both. We have the capacity to do both. We have the opportunity to do both, like many businesses. And we\u2019re taking full advantage of that. Operator : The next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : So, Lal, we\u2019re getting close to fiscal \u201822. So, I know you\u2019re going through the planning process. But, given that the funnel is building here and the activity levels in automation, I\u2019m just curious, normally, early phases of recovery, we see solid double-digit growth in automation. Is there anything that\u2019s changing in terms of the profile of the front-log or backlog or anything that suggests that that\u2019s not going to be the case at time? Can we expect double-digit type growth in \u201822 for automation? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. Hi, Nigel, great to hear your voice. A very thoughtful question actually. And if you go back through the last couple of growth cycles in automation, there was an important component, which we have to watch very carefully in this up cycle, which is the KOB1 element. We benefited from that in the \u201810 to \u201814 run. We surely benefited from that in the prior run in \u201818. But in this one, it\u2019s been subdued to date. And that\u2019s going to be the differentiating. Now keep in mind that we just underwent a significant investment in LNG that is being absorbed by the market. We have yet one big large project to go. But, it\u2019s that -- that would be the -- I\u2019d suggest that differentiated between the high single digits and the double-digit type of organic opportunity in Automation Solutions, if that makes sense to you. Nigel Coe : It absolutely does. Thanks for the color there. And then, just coming on top of Jeff\u2019s question on portfolio, and the October Board pitch, I guess, heard that loud and clear. But given the emphasis on diversification, is it fair to say that you\u2019re focusing here more on acquisitions as opposed to disposals? I know you\u2019ve done a couple of smaller disposals, but in terms of material acquisitions or disposals. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, we announced the divestiture of the Daniel oil and gas business. And what I\u2019m going to tell you is, it\u2019s both. We\u2019re looking at the portfolio, both in terms of opportunities to acquire and/or opportunities to divest. And it\u2019s a very fluid conversation with an element of that with the Board yesterday. We got their support. It\u2019s both. Because to solve, whether it\u2019s the equation around diversification from oil and gas and/or elevate the underlying sales growth of this company, we\u2019re going to have to press both of those buttons. Operator : The next question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Well, can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about the longevity of the Commercial & Residential Solutions cycle at this point? Obviously, [Technical Difficulty] relatively enduring, I think you were worried a bit about residential comparisons toward the end of this year. So, how are you thinking about enduring residential strength as you go into \u201822 as well as the improvements you continue to see in commercial construction, cold chain and tools? Lal Karsanbhai : Great. So, I will bifurcate that into the three -- the two pieces, the climate piece and the tools, professional tools piece. Obviously, the professional tools has a different cycle, partly some of it driven by the similar set of investments that we\u2019re experiencing in client, be it the residential growth, the do-it-yourself investments, which impacts our home products side of the tools. But the professional tools area, the rigid and the Greenlee, they\u2019re really driven by infrastructure spend, capital cycles, not dissimilar to what we see in our mid-cycle automation businesses. And so those, I think, have sustained opportunity as we go well into 2022. The one we\u2019re watching very carefully, as I look at climate, is the air conditioning residential cycle. And we\u2019re watching those orders. We\u2019re staying very close with our OEM customers, the trains and carriers of the world in terms of communicating, understanding their demand. But for now, I would expect a more subdued quarter as we go from an order perspective as we go into the fall season. But, we\u2019re watching it very carefully. But that would make sense in the cycle that it subdues and comes. I know we\u2019ve seen -- you\u2019ve seen in our trailing already that commercial residential has turned, and that\u2019s partly driven and entirely driven by that residential AC business. Ram, do you have any more color to give? Ram Krishnan : No, I think that\u2019s spot on. Andy Kaplowitz : And then, Lal, you talked about being well into your cost-out program, which has been focused on automation solutions, as you know. And incremental margins continue to be strong there. I know we already talked about margin pressure in C&RS. But as we look at Automation Solutions margin going forward, given your cost-out program should continue to drive margin tailwind, could you continue to generate average or better-than-average incremental margin for that business in \u201822 and beyond? Lal Karsanbhai : I think so, Andy. We printed 41% incrementals in that platform this quarter, and the team has begun their significant investments around their technology and people there. The business is structurally different than the business that I took on in 2018 today, in the way it goes about and the way it manages and the way it approaches customers. So, there\u2019s a lot of room there. The target I\u2019ve given the business is obviously is 30% incrementals. But, as we ramp up investments and such, I think we\u2019re likely to see higher than those types of numbers as we go forward. Pete Lilly : I think, our next question is from Scott Davis. Scott, are you there? Scott Davis : I\u2019m here, yes. Good morning, guys. I don\u2019t know if we messed up or whatever, but a couple of clarification issues. Just, Lal, when you think about kind of price-cost in your backlog, do you get to a parity number kind of a calendar 4Q? I\u2019m just trying to think about how cadence is in, or if you still are kind of fighting that headwind well into the next fiscal year? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. It does bleed into the next fiscal. Ram described the next two quarters as being the most challenging, which is right. So, that parity really arrives in our first fiscal -- excuse me, our first calendar of \u201822. So, our second fiscal of \u201822. Ram Krishnan : Yes. Scott Davis : Okay. Sorry if you said it before, I just didn\u2019t hear it. And then, again, to clarify on the cost reduction actions, and you just had a big Board review, is that largely complete, or are there -- and can you -- I guess, do you need to start going in the other direction, I suppose, which I think Andrew asked that question about adding CapEx and such. But, do you need to actually start spending more money just given the size of the backlog overall? Lal Karsanbhai : No. I think, Ram answered that well. I think we\u2019re looking at optionality around capacity increases in the existing footprint and in the footprint that we have initiated as part of the cost reset plan. We have operations in construction of significant size in India, in Mexico and in Eastern Europe, and all those are underway. Some will begin production later this year, others in early 2022. So, we feel really good. The challenge for us, Scott, which is not thematical honestly and not dissimilar from anyone out there, is the labor availability in the United States. And to me, that\u2019s the biggest single constraint and what we\u2019re fighting on a daily basis across most of our facilities. Operator : The next question is from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Pete Lilly : It looks like we may have lost Steve. So, we can move on to the next call -- next question? It looks like our next question is from Deane Dray. Deane, are you with us? Deane Dray : Yes, I am. I missed that whole introduction, too. So, that\u2019s the reason for the delay. Sorry about that. Good morning. So, page 16, the whole three-month underlying orders, can you give us some color on July, because it looks like Automation Solutions is pivoting to growth? And just any kind of color on July would be helpful there. Lal Karsanbhai : I don\u2019t have a number to share with you, Deane, but I would tell you, I think that -- excuse me, somebody came on the line here. That is a fair assumption. We continue to see increased momentum in Automation Solutions. Obviously, we\u2019re watching parts of the world carefully, particularly Southeast Asia and India. But, in large significant markets, Europe, North America and China, we continue to see good order momentum, driven by KOB2 and KOB3. Deane Dray : Got it. And then, second question has been really good color on the call here, especially in the portion from Ram on the focus on the cost inputs, labor, commodities, et cetera, but not as much focus on price realization. Can you give us, for the two segments, more color on pricing? And I know one of the headwinds on Commercial & Residential Solutions, on like Copeland, is locked into longer-term contracts. So, just price realization color would be helpful here. Ram Krishnan : Yes. So first off, I\u2019ll answer the question with -- as it relates to automation, automation has been green on price-cost and has been very, very disciplined in getting price this year, and that dynamic will continue into next year. So, we see no issues as it relates to price or price-cost on the automation side of the business. And on the Commercial & Residential side, particularly in the climate business, the price realization, which is a function of our long-term OEM contracts, will start unlocking in the January time frame of significance. Now, we do have pricing that will go into effect in October, but the big impact we will start to see in the second quarter of fiscal \u201822, which in turn, assuming the commodities start softening, will turn them into the green category into the second quarter of next year. So, that\u2019s how we see it. A lot rides on our contracts, which open up in the Jan time frame. Deane Dray : Got it. So, you said second quarter fiscal next year, but in answering your earlier question, it sounded like you would be at parity in the first fiscal quarter. Did I... Lal Karsanbhai : I corrected myself there, Deane, and I did say... Ram Krishnan : The second. Lal Karsanbhai : First calendar, second fiscal. Operator : The next question is from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Good morning. Can you hear me now? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. Steve Tusa : Sorry. You guys usually have the call in the afternoon. So, I sleep in these days. So, I was just -- I fell asleep there for a second during the Q&A. Just to clarify some of this price-cost, what was price-cost in the quarter? And then, what has it been? Just remind us of what that\u2019s been year-to-date? Ram Krishnan : So Frank, you got that? Frank Dellaquila : Yes. I mean price-cost in the quarter, total enterprise -- Steve, this is Frank -- is roughly about negative $50 million. So, we were positive in the first half. We\u2019ll see that intensifying in the fourth and the first quarter, as both Ram and Lal have said. And we\u2019re going to have to work through that right through the second quarter of next fiscal year. But, it was order of magnitude around $50 million in the third. Steve Tusa : Of negative? Of negative? Frank Dellaquila : Negative. All in commercial residential. Steve Tusa : Right. So, you\u2019re like absorbing a pretty decent amount this quarter already in your ops? Frank Dellaquila : Yes, we are. Yes. This is just about investing in that platform. Steve Tusa : Just kind of -- just trying to make that clear. Lal, just on the go-forward incremental margins, I mean, you kind of throw out, we need to invest. I mean, every company needs to invest. Nobody underinvests. I mean, some companies do, but it doesn\u2019t seem like that way for you guys over time. What is kind of the normal incremental margin on that mid-single-digit growth rate that you can expect out of this business model over the next -- that you would expect and you would be comfortable with over the intermediate term? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. Steve, I continue to asset that 30% number, as we go through the long term. You\u2019ll see that flex up and down, but that\u2019s the target. And as we executed the cost reset plan, that\u2019s the -- how we frame that with the businesses. There will be quarters, as we saw with automation, where we\u2019ll print higher than 40. And there will be quarters as we sell commercial residential that we\u2019ll print forward than 30. So, it will flex, but 30 is the way I\u2019m thinking about it. Steve Tusa : Got it. And then, just one last nitpicky one. Stock comp is obviously up massively this year. I know that there\u2019s -- historically, like every few years, there\u2019s like -- I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s where the reset is or if it\u2019s somewhere else, maybe in corporate. Is 235 kind of a run rate number for stock comp going forward, or does that -- the prior two years were in the low-100. Is that -- does that reset lower? Frank Dellaquila : No, Steve, definitely not. As you know, it\u2019s mark-to-market driven. It\u2019s driven almost entirely as a function of the change in the stock price. We had the dip in the stock price last year related to COVID. We\u2019ve had good stock price performance this year and a big delta year-over-year. But no, that is not a run rate that should be expected, the 250 range. It\u2019s more like a 150 to 170 number, give or take, from a run rate over time. Steve Tusa : Got it. So, tailwind. And then, sorry, one last one. The orders conversion, I know there was an earlier question about mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. I mean, you\u2019re coming off of a 17% orders comp, and I know that orders don\u2019t completely equal revenue in the immediate term. But, I mean, with that kind of orders projection and with you guys talking about turnarounds being good in the fall, I mean, why would organic growth slow in Automation Solutions? It\u2019s a tougher comp, but it\u2019s only a couple of hundred basis points where the orders are just obviously inflected. So, I mean why would that go from 8% to like 5% at the midpoint of that guidance? Is there something about timing, or is that just conservatism around the COVID or whatever? Lal Karsanbhai : Well, less so COVID, more so the availability of materials, particularly electronics, Steve, that are a challenge in that business. And I think as we guided Automation Solutions within that band, I think it\u2019s -- there\u2019s momentum on the order side. The question is, can we convert in the plants? And it is a hand-to-hand combat. I can\u2019t emphasize that enough in terms of material arriving and our ability to have the labor to convert it. And it\u2019s -- and that is what keeps me a little bit more guarded in terms of the order-to-sale conversion in the fourth quarter. Steve Tusa : Right. And that\u2019s kind of like a couple of hundred million dollars difference you think in kind of your ability to fulfill? Lal Karsanbhai : Well, I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know what it is. It\u2019s probably around the $75 million to $100 million range. Steve Tusa : Yes. Okay. Still doesn\u2019t quite bridge the gap, but that\u2019s helpful. All right. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Lal Karsanbhai : Okay. Operator : The next question is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead. Gautam Khanna : I had a couple. First, just fiscal \u201822, based on your comments on the project funnel at Auto Sol, are you thinking that the KOB3 mix stays pretty similar to what it was in fiscal \u201821 as a percentage of sales? And what is that? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. So, the funnel -- I think, the funnel has shown resiliency as we\u2019ve gone through the last six months or so, staying at that 6% level. The makeup of it obviously is different, smaller projects, different types of projects that we\u2019ve seen in our -- from our customer base. Having said that, it\u2019s all about the movement from right to left, the ability to convert the projects to be funded and then to be actioned. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to watch and could be a differentiating element as we head into 2022 for Automation Solutions. I have a high degree of confidence, Gautam, that the transmission distribution funnel moves forward aggressively, that the renewables are sustainable, decarbonization part of the fund moves forward successfully, the conversions, the biofuels, the greenfield investments, the propylene plastic renewables that Colleen described move forward aggressively. What I\u2019ve got to watch very carefully is the larger, particularly LNG jobs, that one big remaining one, the Qatar North Field expansion, [ph] how does that move and how do those folks think about the funding of that and as it moves forward. But that will be differentiating into 2022. Ram Krishnan : And Gautam, if you were asking about the KOB3 mix in addition to the funnel, it\u2019s in the high-50s. And we expect to operate at that range for the next several quarters, probably into the low-60s into 2022. Gautam Khanna : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And as a follow-up to one of the earlier questions at C&RS, in aggregate next year, do you think the business grows organically, just given kind of the outsized strength that we\u2019ve seen this fiscal? Lal Karsanbhai : I believe so, Gautam. And what we are going to, and you\u2019ve seen in the numbers today, is that the backlog situation across the business is at $1.1 billion. And that\u2019s what -- that\u2019s the impetus to drive the organic growth, despite what happens in the residential AC cycle. And that will support the organic growth in the business for \u201822 . Ram Krishnan : The longevity of our commercial businesses as well. Gautam Khanna : Okay. Last question, just your comments on M&A and portfolio. Any change to how much we should earmark for M&A in our models over the next couple of years? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. We\u2019ll come out with guidance as we think about things. Obviously, as I mentioned earlier, Gautam, we are at -- our funnel is very fluid right now. There\u2019s a number of activities underway. And so, -- but, we\u2019ll give you some kind of guidance as we go into -- as we come out in November. Gautam Khanna : Said differently, are there any large properties, bigger than OSI that you guys are looking at? Thank you. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. I will -- yes, there\u2019s a range. I would suggest that we\u2019re looking more in the larger than we are in the bolt-ons right now, Gautam. Operator : Our final questioner today is John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Walsh : A lot of ground covered, but maybe thinking about OSI Power and your customers there. I mean, we picked up that there\u2019s some activity in Spain and a couple of states in the U.S. Are you seeing the customers waiting for more clarity around stimulus before they\u2019re going ahead with projects, or is there just enough demand there, given where renewables sit in the grid that they\u2019re moving forward these projects, and there\u2019s no kind of delay caused by who\u2019s going to pay for it? Lal Karsanbhai : No, I think it\u2019s the latter, absolutely. Aging infrastructure, advent of renewables on to the grid that are causing all kinds of challenges, there are just strong underlying drivers that I think overwhelm the need for stimulus spend there. So, infrastructure bill, particularly in the United States will help, no doubt about it, and we\u2019ll benefit. But there\u2019s incredibly strong underlying demand as is in the traditional utilities, particularly in Western Europe and North America. John Walsh : Great. And then, maybe just circling back to an earlier question around kind of supply chain and backlog. Did you grow backlog? Your sequential backlog growth, was that kind of demand-driven, or do you think there was some supply chain stuff that you wouldn\u2019t have been able to ship and that\u2019s why you were able to grow backlog? Just trying to understand if there\u2019s some delayed sales or deferred sales there because of supply chain. Ram Krishnan : I think the answer is both. Certainly, on many parts of the Automation Solutions business and some in Com Res, the demand side was very strong. And on both platforms, we were not able to fully execute elements of the backlog, given the constraints in labor primarily on the commercial side and electronic supply on the automation side. So, the backlog growth was driven by both fronts, supply and demand. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Lal Karsanbhai for any closing remarks. Lal Karsanbhai : Well, thank you very much. Thank you, everyone, for your time and confidence in us. So, we\u2019re excited about the quarter ahead. And I look forward to seeing many of you as we go through the next three months. And until our next call, stay healthy and safe, and stay well. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this event is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to Colleen Mettler, please go ahead. Colleen Mettler : Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining Emerson's fourth quarter and fiscal year-end Earnings Conference Call. Today, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai, Chief Financial Officer, Frank Dellaquila, and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan. I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Please join me on Slide Q. As always, this presentation may include forward-looking statements which contain a degree of business risks and uncertainties. Please take time to read the safe harbor statement and note on non-GAAP measures. As I turn to Slide 3, I would like to highlight 2 areas where Emerson is making a difference. First, Mike Train (ph), our Chief Sustainability Officer, will be attending this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference [Indiscernible] 26 in Glasgow. Mike will be a panelists of the Adjacent Sustainable Innovation forum, participating in 2 notable discussions. The first discussion will be how to support small to medium enterprises to adopt net 0 pathways, and the second on supporting breakthrough innovation to green hard to abate sectors. Mike has worked this year to drive many greening of, buy and with Emerson initiative. One notable greening by example, in the recent announcement between BayoTech and Emerson to accelerate production of distribution of low cost, low carbon hydrogen. In the agreement, Emerson will deliver advanced automation technology, software, and products, and support a BayoTech building hundreds of fully autonomous hydrogen units to enable hydrogen fuel cell, commercial trucking fleet, and abatement projects in steel and cement. Another exciting initiatives is our a $100 million commitment to corporate venture capital, Emerson Ventures, designed to accelerate innovation by providing insights into cutting-edge technology that have the potential to solve real customer challenges. The investment commitment will advance the development of disruptive discrete automation solutions, environmentally sustainable technologies, and industrial software in key industries. A formal announcement and more information will be seen in tomorrow's press release. Finally, our investor conference historically has been in February. However, due to the recent announcement with AspenTech, we have decided to move our investor conference to May. It will be located at the New York Stock Exchange on May 17th 2022. I'd like to now turn the presentation over to Emerson's President and CEO, Lal Karsanbhai for his opening comments. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you Colleen, and good morning, everyone. 2021 was a phenomenal year for Emerson. It developed very differently obviously than we planned a year ago. For one, I was named CEO and brought a new value creation agenda to the table. But equally important, we operated in an environment which was both rewarding and challenging for the organization. Through it all, our teams around the world did a fabulous job. I want to express my sincere gratitude to all the Emerson employees around the world. Thank you. I will also like to thank Emerson's Board of Directors and our shareholders for your support and confidence in the management team. 2021 was characterized by strong demand in our Residential Air Conditioning business, as well as our hybrid and discrete markets in Automation. Furthermore, we have experienced a recovery in Process Automation markets. The automation KOB3 mix for 2021 was up 2 points to 59%. And Emerson September 3-months trailing orders were plus 16%. We grew 5.3% underlying and leveraged at 38% operationally, inclusive of a $140 million swing in our price cost assumptions from November through the end of the fiscal year. The earnings quality of this Company continues to be excellent, with free cash flow conversion of 129%. The fourth quarter however, was challenged significantly by supply chain, logistics, and labor challenges. And that is not dissimilar from anything you've heard before. This was experienced in the form of material cost inflation, notably, steel, electronics, and resins, and lead time extensions. In addition, we experienced logistics challenges, unavailability of wanes and costs, and lastly U.S. manufacturing labor which was characterized by higher turnover rates, absenteeism, and overtime costs. In the quarter, we missed sales by a $175 million and alongside a challenging price cost environment in our climate business. It resulted in a negative $0.14 impact to EPS for the quarter and then $0.19 impact to 2021 EPS. Having said that, the Company grew 7% in the fourth quarter and had 19% operating leverage. Turning to '22, and some initial thoughts. The first half of the year will not look too similar from the fourth quarter, with slight sequential improvement as we go to Q2. Price cost and supply chain challenges unwind in the second half of the year, against the backdrop of continued strong demand. The price cost assumption in the year will be a positive $100 million for 2022. I'm very optimistic for 2020. The operating environment has unpredictability, but it is significantly more stable than a year ago, and demand is much stronger. The residential AC cycle was moderate as we go through 2022. However, we expect automation markets to continue to strengthen, driven by digital transformation and modernizations, replacement in MRO markets, and select LNG and sustainability driven KOB1. Most notably, methane emissions reduction projects and carbon capture. I have confidence that we will deliver 30% incremental on our underlying sales in 2022. This addresses execution and, as you know, that's one of the three pillars we identified as the management team for accelerated value creation. We have equally taken significant steps in our journey to modernize our culture and advanced ESG initiatives. The board named James Turley as the Company's independent Chair of the Board. We named Mike Train as the Company's first Chief Sustainability Officer. And we hired Elizabeth Adefioye as Emerson's first Chief People Officer. I'm very proud of the diversity targets we set for the enterprise. The changes to our long-term compensation and annual bonus structure to include ESG measures and the commitments we have made to accelerate greenhouse gas intensity reductions. Lastly, turning to the portfolio, please turn to Slide 4. We recently concluded a comprehensive portfolio review, which culminated in a 2-day session with our Board of Directors in early October. We left the meeting with a defined portfolio roadmap and pathways. The key elements were as follows. Firstly, in terms of the portfolio today and how we're thinking about it. Diversification is critical. We will continue to divest upstream oil and gas hardware assets. Secondly, we will action low growth or commoditized businesses and lastly, we will action disconnected assets. All three of these actions will take place over time with intentionality, that patients and a keen awareness of cycles and meeting the value creation proposition to our shareholders. Secondly, we identified 4 large, profitable, high growth end markets, each with at least $20 billion of size and projected to grow higher than 4% a year into the future supported by macros. The 4 end markets will be the hunting ground for our M&A activity. Lastly, we define 2 possible end states for the portfolio in the journey that we'll embark on, and that have embarked on. One of the 4 markets is Industrial Software. A $60 billion a year segment that we identified growing at 9%. The AspenTech transaction is an exciting step for Emerson, and a very important transformational step for this corporation. AspenTech is one of the best run industrial software companies in the space, with highly differentiated technology and a phenomenal leadership team led by Antonio Pietri for who I have the greatest personal admiration. The AspenTech Company will be a highly diversified business with transmission and distribution as its largest served markets and uniquely positioned to enable our energy customers to transition to a lower carbon future. I'm optimistic of the synergy opportunities that exist and believe the new AspenTech, which will be 55% owned by Emerson shareholders, will be a differentiated platform for future industrial software M&A. I'm very excited about this as I hope you can tell. We expect to close the transaction in the second quarter of 2022 following the completion and approval of the customary regulatory items. With that, I will now turn the call over to Frank Dellaquila, Emerson's Chief Financial Officer. Frank Dellaquila : Thank you Lal and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6, if you would. So we're really pleased with financial results for fiscal 2021. As Lal said, we ended the year with a great deal of uncertainty and far exceeded the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. The underlying demand environment developed, such as much as we thought it would, it was continued strength in global discrete and hybrid automation markets and in North America process markets began to gain momentum later in the year. The global demand and our commercial residential markets were strong and broad-based, particularly in the U.S. residential air conditioning market. And it's far exceeding the expectations that we had going into the year. Our operations teams successfully worked through labeling supply chain issues, particularly towards the end of the year, and deliver the strong results that we're able to report to you today. Towards the end of the year, the intensifying combination of rising material costs, supply chain challenges, and labor constraints of the U.S. did begin to weigh on sales volume and profitability. We've worked through that in the fourth quarter and we will continue to work through that in the first half of fiscal 2022. Despite these fourth-quarter challenges, we're pleased to report, as we see, the key financial targets that we committed to you in August regarding underlying growth, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted earnings per share, and cash flow. And you can see all of that in the table. This was achieved in the face of an unexpected increase in key raw materials, mainly steel and copper, that resulted in an unfavorable price cost swing of a $140 million during the year, versus the expectation and the guidance that we gave you a year ago. We're very grateful for the extraordinary effort of our operations teams at every level, and the manufacturing employees who made this happen under some of the most challenging conditions that we've seen. Please turn to Slide 7. This slide highlights our strong 2021 results. The continued recovery in our end markets drove strong full-year underlying growth of more than 5%, net sales were up 9% year-over-year, including a one point impact from acquisitions, mainly OSI, which closed at the beginning of the fiscal year. Adjusted segment, EBITDA benefited from strong leverage and operations. 38% as well I Just mentioned that adjusted EBITDA from underlying volume and the benefit of cost recent actions that were begun 2 years ago. These cost reductions more than offset price cost headwinds, which as I said, we're a $140 million versus our expectation at the beginning of the year, and the supply chain challenges that raised costs and reduced availability. Cash flow was robust, up 18% year-over-year attributable to the strong earnings growth and working capital efficiency. Free cash flow conversion of net earnings was 129%. Adjusted earnings per share was $4.10, exceeding our guide by $0.03 at the midpoint and up 19% for the year. Automation Solutions underlying growth was flat year-over-year, growth turned positive in the second half, driven by strong discrete and hybrid markets, while the later Cycle Process Automation markets delivered sequential improvement as we move through the year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 230 basis points due to the strong leverage driven by cost reset benefits. Commercial and Residential saw exceptional growth of 16% underlying year-over-year due to broad strength across the Residential and Commercial markets with mid-teens growth in all world areas. Adjusted EBITDA increased 20 basis points versus prior year. Price cost headwinds worsened in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter, as we anticipated on the call in August, but were offset for the full year by strong underlying leverage and spending restraints. Please turn to Slide 8. Operational performance was strong throughout the year, adding $0.59 to adjusted EPS, overcoming a $0.19 headwind from supply chain and $90 million of unfavorable price cost. Operations leveraged at more than 35% on volume and cost actions. Non-operating items contributed $0.02 net, overcoming a significant headwind from the stock comp mark-to-market accounting. Share repurchase totaled $500 million as we guided, and added about $0.03. In total, adjusted EPS was $4.10, as I said, an increase of 19%. Please turn to Slide 9. Regarding the fourth quarter, strong end market demand drove underlying growth of 7% with net sales up 9%. This growth was achieved despite $175 million impact from supply chain, logistics and labor constraints that affected both platforms in somewhat different ways. Adjusted segment, EBITDA dropped 10 basis points, reflecting 200 basis point impact from supply chain volume constraints across the Company and from the increasingly negative price cost headwinds in commercial and residential. Free cash flow declined 39% mainly due to higher working capital to support the growth versus the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.21 exceeding the guidance midpoint by $0.03 and up 10%, versus the prior year. Automation Solutions underlying sales were up 3%, with strong recovery in the Americas, particularly in the power generation and chemical markets, partially offset by declines in other world areas. Sales were reduced by about $125 million or 4 points due to supply chain constraints. Our backlog was up 16% year-to-date and now sits at $5.4 billion, or $100 million less than at the end of the third quarter. Typically our backlog would reduce more in Q4. However, due to strong orders and supply chain constraints, backlog remained elevated above the levels we would otherwise have expected. Strong leverage and cost reductions drove a 170 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA. Commercial and residential underlying sales increased 13%, driven by continued strength in North America residential HVAC and home products, as well as heat pump demand in Europe. Sales were reduced by about $50 million or 3 points due to supply chain constraints, which together with sharply increasing material cost headwinds, which were expected, perhaps a little worse than we expected in August before expected, drove a 340 basis points decline in adjusted EBITDA. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Ram to provide color around the price cost, and some of the other operational issues that we are dealing with. Ram Krishnan : Thank you, Frank. Please turn to Slide 10. Clearly, as you can see, the operating environment is a challenge, as commodity inflation, electronics supply, logistics constraints, and labor availability continues to impact our global operations. Net material inflation headwinds, accelerated through fiscal 2021, as you can see on the chart, primarily driven by steel prices, with majority of the impact being felt by our Climate Technologies business. North American cold roll steel pricing, increased once again in October, extending the streak of monthly price increases to 14 months. However, the magnitude of the increases have declined in recent funds and more importantly, hot-rolled steel prices dropped around $20 a ton in October, a positive sign for us. We do anticipate steel prices to start to flatten out over the next few months and net material inflation to peak in the first half of fiscal '22. We continue to stay focused and diligent on our pricing plans by executing on our contractual material pass-through agreements, surcharges for freight and more aggressive annual general price increases. We remain confident that price cost will turn green and will be a strong positive for the second half of fiscal '22. Our current plans indicate that price cost will be approximately a $100 million tailwind for the fiscal year. Turning to the next slide. On the commodity front, while steel prices are at elevated levels today, as I mentioned earlier, they are showing some signs of flattening, providing optimism that we will see North American cold-rolled steel prices start to decline in the coming months. Plastic resin prices have remained elevated due to high price in elastic demand, and weather-related supply challenges. Copper prices have also surged as of late, but our hedge positions will dampen the impact to the fiscal year. Now, while COVID-related restrictions are improving in Southeast Asia, capacity at key electronics suppliers remains constrained. Several key component suppliers have extended lead times, and pushed out delivery forecast, which has increased shortages and decommits to our EMS suppliers. Furthermore, we're closely watching the impact of industrial power outages in China, which has become a common occurrence at manufacturers and has led to an increase in silicon prices. For us, electronic shortages are impacting multiple business units in both platforms and supply is expected to remain a challenge into fiscal 2022. Extended logistics [Indiscernible] times, particularly on ocean freight, has add an impact on our global operations. Port congestion in the U.S., weather and COVID related disruptions in China being the key drivers. These dynamics are highlighting how critical regionalization is even on lower variation parts and components and the work we have done over the past many years to regionalize are clearly proving the importance of this strategy. This is exemplified by several of our businesses with strong regional supply basis, which have performed very well and avoided expensive airfreight and significant expediting costs. Finally, hiring and retention challenges continue in many of our old U.S. plants, predominantly in the Midwest, as competition for available labor is intense. High levels of turnover and absenteeism in these locations, have impacted productivity and driven increased over time. Now on Slide 12, despite the unprecedented challenges, our supply chain and operations teams have worked tirelessly to continue to meet the needs of our global customers. Many creative solutions are being implemented on a real-time basis to ensure continuity of material supply to our global plans, and availability of freight lines to make our shipment commitments. Our teams have leveraged strong supplier relationships, utilized free qualified alternate sources, leveraged contractual agreements, and stepped in to assist our suppliers where needed. Our regional manufacturing footprint, and the enhanced resiliency of our supply network through multi-sourcing that we spent years developing, has certainly been an advantage for us in these challenging times. Accelerated actions around hiring and production shifts to plans with stable work forces as ensured, we continue to meet our customers needs. Many of our global plans are producing at record levels, as our disciplined investments and factory automation have allowed us to unlock additional capacity to [Indiscernible] back labor availability challenges. Finally, I want to take this opportunity to sincerely thank our global teams for delivering an outstanding operational year. With that, I'll turn it over to Lal to walk through our fiscal '22 outlook. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks Ram. Let's please turn to Slide 14 and I'll give the team some color on the current environment. In looking forward to 2022 demand continues to be strong across both the platforms. The trailing 3 month orders for automation solutions were up 20% versus the prior year, driven, as I said prior, by continued automation investments in discrete and hybrid markets. And we believe that will continue to '22, and of course the strengthening of the process automation spend. While KOB2 and KOB3 drove most of the orders growth in 2021, the new infrastructure bookings for L&G and de - carbonization will improve I believe through 2022 providing further upside. Increased site access will drive increased walk-down and shutdown turnaround activity in the business. To give you perspective, 2021 walk-downs were up 50% year-over-year with more than 5,000 globally, with each walk-down driving substantial KOB3 pull through. Shutdown turnaround bookings were up for -- in '21 10% year-over-year, driven by strong spring season that extended into the early summer. 2022 shutdown turnaround outage activity span is expected to be up mid single-digits, led by chemicals and refining, leading to high single-digit bookings growth. Turning to Commercial Residential Solutions, the U.S. and Europe order rates continue to be strong heading into 2022, while Asia has began to moderate. Overall, the 23-month orders were 9% in September. In thinking a little bit further into 2022, many of our key Climate Technology then markets, will continue to have momentum, including aftermarket refrigeration, commercial HVAC, food retail and food service, driven by new store builds and quick service restaurants, and residential Keith Comp. Turning to Slide 15, looking ahead to 2022, it will be a year characterized by strong underlying demand and an improving operating environment. The late cycle process automation business will continue its recovery with mid-single-digit annual growth. Meanwhile, discrete and hybrid momentum will endure with high-single-digit in mid-single-digit growth, respectively. Growth of moderate in residential markets as demand stabilizes, but improving commercial and industrial environments will benefit Commercial Residential Solutions. Decarbonization and sustainability projects as noted earlier, will provide further growth opportunities because budgets get allocated towards these projects. Based on this macro landscape, we believe we too -- we continue to expect demand to be strong in 2022. Supply chain and price cost headwinds continue through the first half, pressuring first quarter leverage, return to significant tailwinds in the second half, and end positive in the year. The team has done a significant amount of work, progressing our restructuring programs. Emerson's 2021 adjusted EBITDA of 23.1%, suppressed our previous record. Over 90% of our restructuring spend communicated in our Investor conference, is complete. And over 70% of the savings have been realized with remaining longer-term facility projects left to be completed. Great work I've seen. Let's turn to Slide 16 and talk about guidance. So given this landscape, we expect underlying sales growth of 6% to 8% in 2022 and net sales growth of 46%. Underlying sales growth for Automation Solutions will be 6% to 8%, while Commercial and Residential Solutions will be 6% to 9%. As Ram discussed, we expect price cost to turning to tailwind for the year of approximately $100 million. $150 million of restructuring activities includes the minimal remaining spend on our cost reset program, and additional programs including footprint activities, that had been identified and are planned in the fiscal year. Historically, our adjusted EPS excludes restructuring and other items like first-year purchasing accounting in the calculation. Looking at the 2021 column of the bridge to the right, our prior adjusted EPS of $4.10 increases to $4.51 when removing the impact of intangibles, amortization expense of $0.41. For 2022, the amortization expense is expected to be approximately $0.42, driven by -- driving our adjusted EPS to between $4.82 and $4.97. Additional details on the calculation are provided in the appendix, as well as the accounting tables in the press release. Please note that old guidance does not include the impact of the AspenTech transaction, which is expected to close as I said earlier, in the second quarter of calendar year 2022. Turning to Slide 17, we expect the first quarter 2022, underlying sales growth of 7% to 9% with broad underlying strength across Automation Solutions and Commercial Residential Solutions. Automation Solutions will experience underlying sales growth in the mid-to-high single-digits, while commercial and residential solutions underlying sales growth will be in the high single-digits to low double-digit range. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $0.98 and $1.02. Amortization for the quarter is expected to be roughly $0.10. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Colleen Mettler. Thank you. Colleen Mettler : Thank you Will. We will now turn the call to the operator to start the Q&A portion of our call. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, guys. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning, Andy. Frank Dellaquila : Good morning, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Well, maybe you could give us a little more color into how you're thinking orders play out in FY22. Obviously, a nice recovery is continued in Automation Solutions, but you mentioned that you think KOB1 bookings could come in LNG and Decarbs. When do you see those types of projects hitting? And could they help maintain bookings growth at current levels as comps begin to get more difficult over the next few months? And then in C&RS, it's held up obviously very well despite Asia moderating a bit. So maybe more color into what you expect there. Lal Karsanbhai : No, I think the environment -- I'll start with Andy with Automation. The strength -- I see the strength in the Process Automation business to continue throughout the year. Very honestly we're in an environment where a $100 oil is not uncertain right now, and we're seeing some restraint in the U.S. shale and discipline and OPEC and things of that sort. That's going to free up significant capacity, particularly at NLCs, and some of the larger integrated companies to move forward on a lot of the programs that will drive the decarbonization initiatives. We've seen that already with many flaring type of projects in the U.S. And we will continue to see that with carbon caption and others accelerating I'm highly optimistic about that. On the LNG side there's 2 significant programs that we're pursuing which will be awarded likely Andy, towards the second half of the year. One is the Baltic L&G, investment and of course the Qatar North field expansion being the two largest. Those are very significant in terms of capacity additions and investment in automation, or are so both in pursuit. Turning to commercial, residential. Yes, I see the residential air conditioning mark in moderating as we go through the year and but, with upheld by the commercial strength in the marketplace, which obviously for us, is very relevant. So I do see more of a mixed bag in the Commercial Residential business driven by that moderation in the residential AC. Andy Kaplowitz : Well that's helpful, man, obviously one of the main concerns that we've heard from investors posting announcement of your deal is that Emerson instead of diversifying actually doubled down on oil and gas. So I'm sure you anticipated that concern. So maybe you could address it head on, Lal. Ultimately, I know you think industrial software as a different market, you just said that in your prepared remarks, but is the view that you believe AspenTech gives you the best chance of hitting or exceeding the long-term guidance you gave us earlier in the year? Lal Karsanbhai : I do. I obviously think that the solutions that AspenTech brings to the table are incredibly broad in terms of -- particularly the sustainability journey. And what we're seeing is that the importance of the software in term -- particularly in terms of design and optimization of assets, will be incredibly relevant as these customers embark on these new -- on the new projects. And so, I regard the energy position as important, but I've regarded more importantly from the transition and the share of wallet spend that there will be undertaken in the Energy segment. Having said that, the platform for investments in diversification, which has been a core component of the Aspen board for a long time, will continue to be important here as we go forward. And the opportunity, whether it's for M&A, and for growth in TD, and other segments is a core part of this synergy value. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks, Lal. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Andy. Operator : The next question is from John Walsh with Credit Suisse, please go ahead. John Walsh : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Frank Dellaquila : Good morning. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning. John. John Walsh : Just wanted to talk a little bit more about the margin bridge here through the year. I think in your prepared remarks, you remain confident in the 30% underlying leverage. Your -- the guide for Q1 implies we're certainly starting I think below that. Is it all just price cost-timing driven, or is there something else there that we should be aware of for our models about the Q1 margin performance. Frank Dellaquila : Yes. Good morning, John. This is Frank. Yes, it is primarily price cost driven. We will be below the 30% assumption for the first half of the year, and then as the price rolls through, which we have -- we had some plans for that to happen. The margins will -- the leverage will increase as we go through the years. So that's how we will get there, but we're very confident that we will in fact in fact get there are obviously, Automation Solutions to leverage is good as we go throughout the year and then, it's in commercial residential where we have the ramp as price cost normalizes and then, turned positive in the second half of the year. John Walsh : Great. And then maybe a question Lal around earlier in the call, you talked about, still some portfolio pruning around some of the upstream oil and gas assets, disconnected assets, within the portfolio. Could you size that for us? What is the revenue size that you're talking about for that bucket? Lal Karsanbhai : No, John, I'm not going to do that, but I will tell you that the activities on the divestitures will be done over time. As I have noted earlier, they'll be done very carefully at times, times with incoming assets as well. Obviously, we have a large impending transaction and on the horizon here. So that's what I will tell you. I do -- I am a firm believer that share of wallet in the energy segment will continue to move to the zeros and ones, and away from hardware structure. And hence, we're going to continue to drive down that path. But in terms of sizing that entire bucket for you. I apologize John, I'm not going to do that. John Walsh : No. Worth the shot. Thank you very much. Appreciate you taking the questions. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, John. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Good morning, guys. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning, Andrew. Frank Dellaquila : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : One question we got in particular, looking at the results from one of your peers yesterday in Auto Sol, how do you guys reconcile 20% year-over-year orders growth, 16% year-over-year backlog growth, and then 6% to 8% FY22 organic revenue guidance? What's incorporated into the FY22 revenue guidance? I know you gave us some color, but just the disconnect. Lal Karsanbhai : Obviously, as we finished -- as we went into September and into the first quarter, we have some comps that are still favorable in the business. So that's one element of it. And then I think normalizing as we go into what it will be, I think still a very strong environment, and how I felt was important for us to guide in that business. And you're right, I think that the opportunities across the three served segments of the market of there's strong I think the underlying demand is very strong. But in terms of guiding with certain and -- some uncertainties remaining in the supply chain environment, I wanted to be somewhat cautious as well. But having said that, the demand picture is very optimistic. Andrew Obin : Makes perfect sense, and other question was sort of get a lot of big to date for investors. Just sort of sense of inventories in the channel. And your customers, right, because one big theme this earning season, there's a lot of companies bringing up, even companies who was very short-cycle businesses, bringing up these very strong backlogs even for companies that don't have backlogs usually. And I think, Investors are just worried that this may not end well, sometime midyear, next year. What's your sense of inventories in the channel and your customers? How do we think that plays out throughout your fiscal '22 or calendar '22, however you want to discuss, because your team has seen many cycle and this one seems to be a little bit different than way? Thank you. Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah. And I'll start, I'll turn it to Ram for a couple of comments as well. Look, on the automation side, I really don't see that as a concern. Most of the [Indiscernible] part of the business, obviously 59% in the year was booked to ship KOB3, and they went directly into -- not into inventories, but into predominantly application -- end-user application. As you turn into the Climate Business, Ram, perhaps a few comment from you. Ram Krishnan : Yeah, I would say across both our OEMs and in the wholesale community, Andrew, I would say inventories are slightly elevated to where they would be in normal times as people anticipate supply chain challenges and have been bringing in more material. With that said, I think the inventory is getting out into the end customer base through the wholesale channel and through our OEM. So I would say it's not a big issue per say and it maybe it'd be slight elevated levels, but it's not something that is unreasonable or unseasonal. Andrew Obin : I really appreciate your answer. Thanks a lot. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : The next question is from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead. Tommy Moll : Morning and thanks for taking my questions. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Tommy. Tommy Moll : I wanted to start on your outlook for Automation Solutions. I think you called for 6% to 8% underlying in the 2022 outlook. I'm curious what your visibility and assumptions are there for oil and gas customers. You're planning your fiscal year here, several months in advance of when a lot of them well, and I'm just looking at $80 crude and wondering potentially when those budgets are rolled out at year-end or early next year, if there's some substantial upside potential? Lal Karsanbhai : It's a great question. Obviously, we are 3 months [Indiscernible], 4 months ahead of seeing those budgets, their capital budgets. What we are seeing and have assumed, Tommy, is a continued strength in the operating budget spend, which is, as you know, where a significant amount of the KOB3 and some KOB2 falls into. That strength picked up in the second half of fiscal 2021, and we assume and believe it will continue to accelerate as we go through 2022. But in terms of the capital environments beyond the two LNG jobs that I've -- that are obviously funded and moving through bidding phases. We will see what else comes out at the capital plans. But I would expect, Tommy, that there would be sustainable type of investments. Again, the methane emissions is a big deal. I think we saw something from the U.S. around those standards. And of course, carbon capture, of which I think, will be more and more significant as we go through the year. So we'll see. But you're right, we'll watch that very carefully as we go into Jan. Tommy Moll : Thank you for that. That's helpful. I wanted to pivot to OSI. Can you refresh us on what the top line contribution was in '21? What's your plan is for '22? And I think, it's likely going to be fair to say you've realized some revenue synergies since acquiring the asset and any anecdotes you could share on how you were able to drive those in such a short timeframe would be helpful. Thanks. Lal Karsanbhai : So phenomenal first year for the Company, approximately a $190 million in revenue in 2021, growing to approximately $220 in 2022. Well ahead of Synergy board plans, the great execution globally. We won our first transmission distribution project in Europe, with a very large customer in the Netherlands and Northern Germany. We won our first transmission distribution project in Australia, in Tasmania. Again, planting critical flags. And we're significantly engaged with the large power producers in transmission companies in the U.S.. So realizing the synergies, and great growth and profitability. So I feel really good about the acquisition. And as it goes into AspenTech, it goes in -- with lots of momentum into the business. Tommy Moll : I appreciate it, and I'll turn it back. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, gentleman. Frank Dellaquila : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi good morning, guys. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning. Good Morning, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Well, just wondering on the Auto Sol side, maybe hoping to shore up some of the growth differential you guys are looking at, versus Rockwell yesterday. Any observation on the mechanical or say, balance and controls type business, versus more of the software and automation side? Is there a wider spread in that outlook for 2022 than usual? Lal Karsanbhai : Well, not really. Obviously, our systems and software business has outgrown our device business. Our digital transformation initiatives which are both software and device-based, have outgrown the remainder of the business. But having said that, I really don't -- I wouldn't note a significant difference as you go through a lot of the KOB3 business is device layer type of business where you'd see perhaps a little bit of a bifurcation to be honest. Because if you look at the KOB1 heavy dependent businesses, some of those in final control. But, beyond that, I'd suggest that we will see broad portfolio alignment as we go through and it's really delta of a point or so between them. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then, just shifting over to CNRS. I guess first, what is the -- and I apologize if I missed it. What's the price embedded in that outlook. And then you mentioned steel is coming down. Maybe prospectively based on futures. I know some of that is sort of contractually set, like, if that comes down, is that going to the calculation for how prices -- it's divined with the OEM relationships there. Thanks. Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead. Ram Krishnan : Yes. So this is Ram Krishnan. On the -- I'll answer the steel question first. So obviously, as steel [Indiscernible] to come down in the second half that we've modeled it as a moderate decline in the second half. But any significant [Indiscernible] to that really doesn't impact '22, but will translate into our pricing dynamics for '23. So it's not necessarily a concern for us in '22 and we'll watch that carefully. Obviously, we'd like it to come down which will impact the second half or help us in the second half. So that's on the steel piece. On the pricing piece, I think whatever is the inflation, I don't think we're going to give out an exact price number, but obviously the inflationary dynamics of '21 will translate and convert into material price plus through price that we will realize in '22 Josh Pokrzywinski : [Indiscernible] color. [Indiscernible] Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning Deane. Frank Dellaquila : Good Morning Deane. Deane Dray : Quick question for Frank, if I could. Free cash flow was well below your 4Q average. I know you called that working capital pressures. Maybe some color there would be helpful. Thanks. Frank Dellaquila : I mean, per the nature of the sales ramp and the comparison versus prior year when we were taking cash off the balance sheet, I think we have a little bit of a dislocation there in the fourth quarter Deane that will normalize. The year was very, very strong, but the cash flow was lumpy, given the way the year played out, and particularly, in commercial and residential. Deane Dray : Got it. And then for Lal, on the expectation, focusing M&A on industrial software, since it is a new structure for us with Aspen Technology, when you say industrials, where I position? Is that an Emerson driven? Is it Aspen? Would it be folded into Aspen? Does Aspen have -- are they part of the review process? And so forth. Thank you. Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah, sure. In the -- no. Industrial software M&A will occur at AspenTech. And Lal Karsanbhai : Deane, it will occur at AspenTech. Having said that, Industrial Software is only one of the 3 large market segments, Deane, that we will be acquisitive in. And you'll see those as we play those out. Obviously, they will become public knowledge. But no, I -- we've got a great platform there to transact M&A softer with what I believe will be a market multiple, that will enable the economics to work from a transaction perspective, and from a value creation perspective. Deane Dray : That's really helpful. Thank you. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you. Thanks, Deane. Operator : The next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning. Jeff Sprague : Hey Lal, good morning [Indiscernible] to the portfolio review, the comment about two end states. I would suppose that means you do the addition and subtraction you're talking about and then continue to [Indiscernible] as Emerson. There's option one and options two. As you do that, and then perhaps separate. If there's more that you can share on your thought process there or what might be kind of the triggering mechanisms of one over the other that would certainly be interesting? Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah, I know. I think we're going to play this [Indiscernible] as I've mentioned earlier over time. And I think I used the expression when we were in New York for the AspenTech transaction announcement, that this is a marathon, that we're going to be very deliberate and thoughtful as we go through this. We're going to be keenly aware of the value proposition to the shareholders and impacts to the cash flow, and impacts to value creation as we go through the journey. The end game, of course, is to create a portfolio that's more connected. A portfolio that has an underlying sales potential, that is higher and consequently can deliver through cycles, double-digit EPS. That's the objective here. And for that, we need to expose the portfolio to more of those markets. And between the strong Balance sheet of the Company, the strong Balance sheet that AspenTech will have as well, and the divestiture work on this side, I think we'll get there over a number of years. But there were meaningful conversations with our Board. There were great debates. Obviously, this was a body of work over a number of months, almost 4 months, that our partners did alongside management, and -- but we have pathways now and optionality. And this is why we have 2 potential end-stage here. Jeff Sprague : Great. And then just as a follow-up, sort of a bundled question around price cost and margins and the like. The price cost positive of a $100 million, does that arithmetic get you to margin neutral on price cost? And then, kind of separate, but I guess related, just the additional restructuring that you're doing, can you elaborate on that a little bit? And what kind of savings tailwind you're expecting in '22 from both the actions you took in '21 and the new actions you're talking about here in '22? Thank you. Frank Dellaquila : Yeah. Hey, Jeff, this is Frank. So the -- I mean, we're thinking about it in terms of delivering the leverage on the business for the price cost in isolation. Obviously, on the way up is not necessarily margin accretive. So we're just looking at it holistically in terms of delivering 30% plus operating leverage for the business for the year. The price cost, given the way it has rolled and will roll through, very lumpy, very distortive within the quarter. So we're just very focused on getting to that goal for the year, delivering up margins, and for the total enterprise, and delivering the operating leverage. Regarding the restructuring. I'll take a quick stab and then let Ram rollout and can come in. And your question was around the continued restructuring spend. So as we go through this week, we identify additional opportunities in both businesses. Some of it is footprint consolidation. I mean, the cost reduction March is kind of a never-ending [Indiscernible] and [Indiscernible]. Obviously very significant opportunities that we've executed on for the most part, when we talked about driving to previous peak margins. But, there's more to do in a complex business, we're continually trying to improve the cost position. And frankly, much of what we do in terms CapEx and restructuring over the next couple of years will be around capacity expansion for the breadth that we expect to see in both businesses. So we may be engaged in some restructuring that's a little bit higher than our historical levels, but it's all around continuing improving the cost position than putting in the capacity in the right places. Jeff Sprague : [Indiscernible] you've said it well. Lal Karsanbhai : Okay. Hello. Colleen Mettler : The next question. Operator : The next question is from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning, Scott. Frank Dellaquila : Morning, Scott. Scott Davis : Best of luck for 2022. I had a couple of questions here for you guys. First, the 30% incremental that you referenced, Lal, is that more of a baseline or a goal. Does that include the price -- the $100 million price tailwind. If you answered some of that, I apologize, but just looking for more color on that. Lal Karsanbhai : No, that is the plan. That's what the fiscal plan rolls up into commitment we're making. It does include the price. Obviously it's all in of first half headwinds that we described in second-half turning into tailwinds, whether that's price cost or supply chain. But as Frank I think said, that will be below in the first half, as we were and improve as we get into the second half, obviously. But for the year, I feel very, very good about the 3 points of incremental on the underlying sales. Scott Davis : Okay, and then the comments that you made around carbon capture, methane, LNG, is there a point where you can start to measure what percentage of your orders those particular types of projects represent, where we can get a sense of the materiality of the future growth there? Lal Karsanbhai : I think that's a great question, Scott, as well. We identified approximately a $1 billion of KOB1 projects. Now, that includes also transmission distribution, but also a whole slew of sustainability and renewable jobs, inclusive of hydrogen, including our carbon capture, etc., Biofuels, and other things. So as we go forward, I -- and then we've continued to look at our funnel, and address our funnel and how we communicate the funnel. I think it will be important for us to break those on, and give you some visibility too. So I think that's a fair question. Scott Davis : Okay. Well, good luck in 2022. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Scott. Scott Davis : Thank you. I'll pass it. Frank Dellaquila : Thank you, Scott. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Just wanted to -- good morning. Just wanted to start with the Automation Solutions organic growth guide. So you're assuming that that business grows about 7% this quarter. And then the same over the subsequent 3 quarters, even as the comps get a lot more difficult. So I just want to understand, is sort of everything in that segment, steady-state as you go through the year in terms of hybrid versus process versus discrete, or KOB1, 2, and 3, or is there something changing across either of those [Indiscernible] kind of as you move through the year, that allows the organic growth rate to hold steady even with tougher comps. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. Great question Julian, good to hear your voice. Yes. So, backlog situation normal if you look at our typical performance in Automation, Q3, Q4 last year, for example, I believe we reduced backlog by about $400 million. This year we reduced it by $100 million. A lot of that was reflected in that $125 million [Indiscernible] in the quarter for Automation Solutions. So the backlog situation coming into the obviously, is stronger. But having said that, we do expect KOB3 to remain strong. I think the data that we're seeing in the commitments our customers are making, particularly around STL activity, is very, very robust. And then secondly, modernization programs and the KOB1 that I outlined, whether that is sustainability or LNG, I think will come in and support the second half of the year. Obviously, KOB1, for the most part, will not turn into revenue, with the exception of perhaps some of the earlier feed stuff that in our systems business, as you know, Julian. But robust, and we will pick up as we go through the second half of the year. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Thank you. And then just switching to Com-Res. 50% plus of the revenues in that business a residential facing. You do call out the slowdown that you're embedding in Resi through the year, but it doesn't sound as if any major cliff is looming as you see it today. Maybe discuss how you're thinking about the situation of the OEMs in Resi, and how confident you are that you can sustain positive growth through the year in Resi with tough comps. Lal Karsanbhai : Our perspective is that we've got a couple of looming regulatory changes on the environment. Efficiency and obviously, referred to our new efficient '23 and refrigerants in '25. It's been an interesting cycle to call where I've spent a time with 2 of our largest OEM customers this quarter. I went down to Carolina, visited with Train, and went down in Miami and visited with Carrier. And we're staying very locked step in terms of understanding their demand and their projections for demand as we go through the fiscal. But we do believe that there's a moderation, not a cliff as we go through the year. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Lal Karsanbhai : Great. Well, Julian, thank you very much and with that, I think we're going to close the call. I thank you all for your time this morning and I appreciate the questions and thank you for your support. Operator : The conference call has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's Business Edition. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask question. [Operator Instruction] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Colleen Mettler. Please go ahead. Colleen Mettler : Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining Emerson's First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; Chief Financial Officer, Frank Dellaquila; and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Please join me on Slide 2. This presentation may include forward-looking statements, which contain a degree of business risks and uncertainties. Please take time to read the safe harbor statement and note on the non-GAAP measures. Turning to Slide 3. I would like to highlight a few exciting accomplishments for Emerson this quarter. First, in December, Emerson announced the acquisition of Mita-Teknik, a leader in wind power control automation. Mita-Teknik brings specific control design, expertise, complementing our existing Emerson\u2019s Ovation and power portfolio. We are very excited to welcome the Mita-Teknik team to Emerson and its ability to expand our renewable power generation capability. Secondly, Emerson was recently named the 2022 Industrial IoT Company of the Year award by IoT Breakthrough. Emerson was acknowledged for advanced digital technologies, software and analytics that help customers across a range of critical industries, optimize their operations and deliver on environmental sustainability goals. Finally, last week, Emerson was recognized as a 2022 Best Place to Work for the LGBTQ+ equality, and earned a score of 100% on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index. Before I turn it over to Lal, I wanted to provide a brief update regarding one of our previously communicated investor events. We are now planning to host a half-day in-person investor conference in the second half of this calendar year where we will provide an overview of our business strategy, portfolio direction and long-term financial outlook. We look forward to sharing additional information as we finalize details for this event. I'll turn the presentation over to Emerson's President and CEO, Lal Karsanbhai, for his opening remarks. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Colleen. I'd like to begin by recognizing the exceptional work that nearly 90,000 Emerson employees did to deliver our first quarter results. I'd also like to express my gratitude to the OCE and the Board of Directors for their continued support. And last, but certainly not least, to our shareholders for your trust and investment in our company. Saturday, February 5, marks my first year anniversary as CEO of Emerson. And although I do not intend this to be a holistic reflection of my first year, I would like to share 5 important learnings : one, build good teams and empower them to lead. We have a very strong new OCE. We hired our first Chief People Officer, our first Chief Sustainability Officer, named a new Chief Operating Officer and named our Chief Compliance Officer, to the OCE. And we have an independent chair of the Board, Jim Turley, a great partner for the shareholders and the management of this company. Number 2, diversity makes us better. It is my goal to continue to create a workplace where people feel like they belong, have a place and can be themselves. I'm very proud of the diversity targets we established to double representation of women and U.S. minorities in leadership by 2030. Number 3, strengthening any business starts with strengthening its culture. Culture transformation is well underway at Emerson, and it includes the redesign of the Emerson management process into a new modern cohesive system. Number 4, think boldly. Emerson is a historic company going back to 1890. But we cannot be afraid of change and must always be keenly aware of the value creation levers at our disposal. Number 5, tomorrow starts with us. We will live our purpose. We will drive innovation that makes the world healthier, safer, smarter and more sustainable. We will create accelerated value through culture, portfolio and execution. Allow me now to turn to the quarter. It was a very positive quarter, significant from a number of dimensions as we delivered $1.05 of adjusted EPS, an increase of 13% over 2021 Q1. Demand is accelerating in Automation Solutions and continues to be very strong in Commercial & Residential Solutions. The trailing 3-month underlying orders were up 17%, for the enterprise as a whole. Our relevance with our customers continues to be a differentiator across all of our businesses, whether it is the energy customer undergoing a critical transformation to a carbon-free or lower carbon future or new energy economy start-up customer in hydrogen of biogas. Our KOB funnel continues to be very robust, valued at approximately $6.5 billion at the end of the quarter, and KOB 3 hit 60% of total automation revenues in the quarter. Interestingly as well, the sustainability and decarbonization element of the funnel is now valued at over $800 million, up over $100 million over this time last quarter, very positive. Our HVAC OEM customers who rely on our compression and electronics know-how to make their systems more efficient to meet new regulatory standards. And also, the tradesmen, the utility workers, the plumbers, many of whom, as I continue to learn, have rich [indiscernible] who trust our gear to get the job done. Over the past 100 days or so, I had the opportunity along with many members of management to meet these customers, representing a broad cross-section of our markets and feel great about the role that we continue to play in making them successful. Our execution in the quarter was excellent. We improved adjusted EBIT margin a 140 EBITDA margins -- 140 basis points to 19.6%, delivering incrementals of 32% across the enterprise. The automation business is operating at historical levels of profitability with adjusted EBITDA margins increasing 320 basis points to 21.5%. Our commercial and residential business was faced with planned but unprecedented price cost challenges, and the team performed exceptionally well. We have confidence in the price and cost management actions that are in place as we go through 2022. We will speak about the operating challenges that continue to be prevalent and most importantly, what we are doing to address them. These include electronics, both lead time, extensions and purchase price variances and shortages, particularly that impacted automation solutions sales in the quarter, logistics and freight cost escalations and labor wage inflation and availability that are concerns, particularly in North America. In most of these cases, we feel better today than we did 3 months ago, but they do remain challenging. And we have been aggressive and implemented further price plans to offset these additional costs. Lastly, overall, I have and we, as management, have increased confidence in our 2022 financial plan. We have increased our underlying sales growth estimates for the year to 7% to 9%, up by 1 point and the adjusted EPS target to $4.90 to $5.05, about 10% increase over last year at the midpoint. I've often said to the management team that sometimes growth isn't a lot of fun because we are working so hard. But I'll tell you that there is no other team I'd rather do it with and this thing here at Emerson. Let's now turn to Chart 5, please. We continue to see increasingly strong levels of demand across both platforms and all world areas. In Commercial & Residential Solutions, trailing 3-month orders were up 13%, continue an extraordinary level of demand. The European heat pump market continues to benefit from ongoing electrification trends in Europe. For our tools business, we see long-term cycle demand related to the housing market to remain strong with favorable macro trends and fundamentals, including DIY trends. At the same time, I believe commercial and industrial segments are seeing considerable strength with project starts in the U.S. and Europe. The trailing 3-month orders for Automation Solutions were up 19% versus prior year, and there is broad strength across discrete, hybrid and process markets across all world areas. China orders were up 34% on a destination basis and continues to be an important growth region. Sustainability-related investments, as I referenced earlier, continue to be a key driver for our business, including renewable and great investments, which benefit our power and OSI businesses. We are also seeing continued recovery in our energy markets with capital spending budgets up significantly year-over-year, in part due to LNG and Middle East investments. Portions of these budgets are being dedicated to decarbonization, emissions and energy efficiency projects, which are accelerating as our customers take tangible steps in pursuit of their ESG targets. To provide a little color on this, I'll highlight a few of our recent project wins related to this growth sector on Slide 6. First, let's start on the left of the chart. Emerson was recently awarded 2 sizable projects in the Middle East with our Measurement Solutions business to help customers reduce emissions. These solutions provide continuous monitoring systems, allowing customers to take preventive actions against emissions and releases. The main driver behind these projects was the customer's commitment to emissions reductions as part of net zero targets. Both projects were supported by environmental regulations in the Middle East to minimize emissions, protecting the environment and community. Next, in the middle, a refining customer in Europe has chosen Emerson to implement a full-scale automation and control modernization of one of their compressor units. The upgraded system, utilizing DeltaV PK controller and control software solutions will provide greater control and load sharing of their system. This greater degree of automation, control and advanced compressor application is uniquely provided by Emerson, and will allow the customer to optimize their operations, thereby increasing their efficiency in reducing energy and load requirements. Solutions like this can help customers use up to 30% less energy in their operations, that's a critical number. And that's a critical piece of what many customers net zero -- of the many customers' net zero journeys. And then finally, on the right, last month, Emerson announced participation in the Poseidon project in the Netherlands. Poseidon will be the world's first offshore hydrogen generation projects, basing an electrolyzer on an offshore platform, coupled with nearby offshore wind power generation. Offshore wind will power the electrolysis of the mineralized seawater to produce hydrogen, which should then be transported to shore for integration with natural gas in the national gas grid. Working as 1 of the key consortium partners with Neptune Energy, Emerson will deploy DeltaV software and systems to manage desalination, electrolysis, gas transportation and the associated infrastructure. Learnings from this project should help provide a broader pathway to large-scale offshore green hydrogen production. So we're very excited with this partnership. These are just 3 examples of how Emerson is assisting our current and new customers on the net zero and sustainability journey. And with that, I'll pass the call over to Frank Dellaquila, who will go through our financial results for the first quarter. Frank Dellaquila : Thank you, Lal, and good morning, everyone. Appreciate you joining us. If you would please join me on Slide 7, I'll go through the quarter. As Lal mentioned, the quarter was very strong. Our business has delivered excellent financial results in the face of some significant operational challenges, and we're very grateful to the people who are working very hard to get through this time of unique challenge in operations. Our end market demand continues to be robust across most key end markets, and it drove first quarter underlying growth of 8%, which is in line with our November guidance. This growth was achieved despite the significant supply chain issues that affected the availability of certain production inputs from time to time as we went through the quarter. In particular, electronic component availability in certain automation solutions product lines constrained sales in the quarter. Despite these challenges, adjustment segment EBITDA increased 80 basis points, driven by volume leverage, price realization and continued effective cost management. Please recall that as we explained in November, adjusted segment margins now additionally exclude intangibles amortization expense. Adjusted EPS was $1.05, up 13% versus the prior year and exceeding the November guide of $0.98 to $1.02. Free cash flow was down 41% versus the prior year mainly due to higher inventory as a result of defensive stocking due to supply chain bottlenecks, finished goods awaiting shipment, but most importantly, higher expected sales in the second half of the year. We believe this impact on cash flow is mainly timing related and we maintain our outlook for the year. And I should point out that our first quarter cash flow last year was at a very high level versus history, just given the dynamics and the ramp-up in our commercial and residential business in last year's first quarter. Turning to the platform results. Both businesses executed extremely well in the face of the operational challenges. Automation Solutions underlying sales were up 5%, continued recovery in the Americas and strong growth in Asia, particularly in China. All key end markets showed strength in particular, life sciences, discrete automation, chemicals and power. KOB 3 activity continues to be strong, rising to 60% of sales in the quarter. Sales were 1 point below our guide mainly because of the availability of electronics components that affected our systems and instrumentation businesses. Backlog increased by $500 million to $6 billion due to the strong pace of orders. We expect that our ability to convert orders and backlog to sales will improve throughout the balance of the year. Automation Solutions adjusted EBITDA improved 320 basis points versus the prior year on the strength of leverage, price realization and cost control. Operational performance in Commercial & Residential Solutions was also very strong. Underlying sales increased 13%, including 5 points of price realization. In Climate Technologies, residential demand continues to be strong in the U.S. as well as commercial and service businesses growing well. Strength in residential construction, DIY and retail demand underpinned strong demand in home tools and home products. Backlog in the platform increased $150 million in the quarter to $1.3 billion, mainly in Climate Technologies. Adjusted EBITDA was down 320 basis points, consistent with our expectations for the quarter due mainly to unfavorable price/cost, logistics and wage inflation, which we will talk more about. Underlying leverage and operational performance in the business was excellent. Price cost, as we have traditionally defined it, is price less net material inflation, and that was modestly better than expected in the quarter. However, we are seeing increasing acceleration in terms of freight and wage costs due to logistics constraints and the tight labor market conditions. We are taking price actions incrementally to offset these incremental costs. We continue to expect to see tailwinds for price cost, again, as we define it in the second half. Please turn to Page 8, and I'll take you through the EPS bridge. EPS bridge is pretty straightforward. Adjusted EPS was $1.05, up 13%. And as I said, exceeding the guidance midpoint by $0.05 despite a $0.06 headwind from tax attributable to some internal reorganizations. So as you can see, the nonoperating items wash out and the increase in adjusted EPS is on the strength of operating performance. Again, as a reminder, adjusted EPS excludes intangibles amortization, restructuring, AspenTech transaction fees, first year purchase accounting and the gain from our Vertiv subordinated interest that we recorded in the first quarter. Operations leveraged at over 30% and contributed $0.10 to EPS. Share repurchase was about $260 million, and added $0.02. We do continue to deal, as I said, with the various operational challenges and supply chain logistics and labor. Our teams are doing a great job mitigating the impact of these. I'm going to hand the call off to Ram to provide more detail on what challenges we're facing and what we're doing about it. Ram Krishnan : Thank you, Frank. Please turn to Slide 9. Clearly, the operating environment remained a challenge in the quarter as electronic supply, labor availability and logistics constraints continue to impact our global operations. Electronic component availability drove the miss versus our Automation Solutions sales guide in the quarter and shown on this slide is what we're currently facing. Availability challenges continue to persist, but we are seeing signs of stabilization at longer lead times, which our operations teams have now calibrated to. While we still see some spot shortages, on certain electronic components, the number of decommits and pushouts from our suppliers is certainly reducing. We expect these challenges to continue into the second quarter and the rest of the year. And hence, we continue to qualify and ramp up secondary supply and proactively redesigning our products to utilize available components. Our global teams have done an outstanding job actively communicating with both suppliers and customers for improved visibility and forecasting. On the labor front, U.S. turnover remains high but has been manageable. We did, however, see absenteeism rise in November and December due to Omicron. We saw numbers as high as 20% absenteeism in some of our plants in the Midwest. Overall, though, our plant operations have improved their ability to manage through the labor dynamics by adjusting hiring practices and entry-level wages to ensure labor availability and are certainly gearing up for a pickup in output levels as we enter the second half of the fiscal year. Finally, as Frank mentioned, we are seeing incremental wage inflation manifest, but these are being offset with our pricing programs. Logistics continues to be constrained by the ongoing supply and demand imbalances and rolling COVID unplanned disruptions. Our teams are mitigating the impact by leveraging alternate ports and our regionalization strategy certainly continues to position us well versus our peers. Freight costs have risen to record levels across the businesses in the quarter, we are mitigating these impacts through surcharges. Finally, our global operations teams continue to work diligently on these challenges, ensuring that our continued operational excellence remains a strong differentiator. I will now turn the call back over to Frank. Frank Dellaquila : Thank you, Ram. If you would please join me on Slide 11, and I'll go through the outlook for the rest of the year. As Lal mentioned at the top of the call, we continue to see strong demand across nearly all businesses in the world areas, and this underpins our improved outlook for the year. Within Automation Solutions, we see relevant CapEx spend rising in 2022, supported by recent LNG projects reaching final investment decision as well as strength in the Middle East. Our MRO and recurring revenue business also will benefit as budgets continue to increase. Sustainability-related investments like the projects Lal described continue to be a key driver for our business. And although electronic component availability challenges will continue to limit top side growth potential in the near term, we are seeing stabilization of supplier lead times at longer-than-usual levels but our operations are calibrating to maximize output, as Ram described under those circumstances. Discrete investments remain strong, and we expect a supportive automotive demand environment in the second half along with continued factory automation projects. We expect hybrid demand to remain strong at mid- to high single digits, including continued life sciences investments, and we continue to be encouraged by process automation, market demand and spend as we've discussed. This continued strength in our core markets, the wave of sustainability investments and our backlog and continued order momentum provide the underpinning for strong second half sales growth and gives us confidence in our ability to deliver the fiscal year sales guidance. In Commercial & Residential Solutions, we expect continued solid growth and expect the impact of moderation in the residential markets throughout the balance of 2022 to be mitigated by continued strength in commercial and industrial markets. Our Pro Tools business is seeing considerable strength with project starts that drive our U.S. and Europe momentum. Overall, Commercial & Residential Solutions, we expect high single-digit to low double-digit growth in Q2 and for the full year. Please join me on Slide 12. So in view of the strong demand backdrop and the backlog, tempered by uncertainty and limited visibility around some of the operational challenges, we are raising our underlying sales guide expectations to 7% to 9% for the year, with net sales growth of 6% to 8% currency having an impact of 1 point. The Automation Solutions guide increases to 79% and Commercial & Residential Solutions increases to 9% to 11% all on an underlying basis. We did increase our price cost guide to favourable $175 million as our businesses implement incremental discretionary price actions to mitigate modestly higher NMI, but in response also to the higher freight costs and wage inflation. And as a reminder, both of which are not included in our typical price cost calculation. Simply said, the increase in the price cost guidance has a minimal impact to our profitability at the margin. Restructuring actions tax, cash flow, the dividend and share repurchase are all consistent with our November guide. The GAAP EPS guide is updated for our improved sales outlook and now includes 2 items related to the AspenTech transaction. Estimated transaction fees and interest expense on $3 billion of term debt that we issued in December in anticipation of the closing. Those items reduce our GAAP EPS guide versus the November guide net of our operations improvement, and the guide is now $4.71 to $4.86. The adjusted EPS guide, which excludes those items, increases to $4.90 and to $5.05. To be clear, no estimate of the operational impact of AspenTech is included in these guidance numbers. We will address that in May after we close the transaction. With that, I thank you for your time and attention, and I will turn the call back over to Lal for some closing comments. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. Thank you. And thank you, Frank and Ram. And before opening up to Q&A, I'd like to acknowledge and you referenced it a couple of times, Frank, the AspenTech team for their strong performance in the quarter, they did report last week. The team and the business is benefiting from increased demand for their software solutions in the sustainability and electrification efforts of its traditional customer base. We are on track to close the transaction as previously communicated in the second calendar quarter of 2022. And with that, I turn to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : A couple of questions. The first, I would love to hear just more broadly or holistically, what kind of management processes had to change in your first year and what the impact is? And then on the business side, the question on the KOB 3 being as high as 67% when we're in a period of spiking oil prices, and I get that you're less dependent on oil per se. But when you get a spike in oil prices, doesn't that -- don't the refiners tend to hold back on maintenance. They just want to run as fast as they can as much as they can at these higher prices? And does that end up crimping some of that MRO spend? So 2 questions. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, Deane. Great. So very good around the management process. We are essentially in the redesign phase as we speak. We'll speak about it holistically when we get together later in the year on our investor conference. But essentially, what we're doing, Deane, is a redesign of a process that was, for the most part, put in place in the mid-70s and we've been operating the company around that. A lot of goodness and what that's brought to us, but we believe that we have an opportunity to really challenge and create a system that can drive more innovation, collaboration and perhaps, a little more risk taking within the business itself. So we're working that. We'll talk to you about how that translates ultimately into our continued ability to execute and to meet our commitments. So we look forward to that later in the year. Related to your KOB 3, the number is 6-0, 60%. I apologize if hadn't come across clearly earlier. It's driven predominantly by modernizations, digital, a number of the smaller sustainability type programs like flare reduction, eliminations and emission reductions fall into the category. Keep in mind also, Deane, that we had a significant amount of delayed maintenance that occurred in most of these plants through COVID, where staff left and a lot of what needed to be done just wasn't done over periods of as much as 1.5 years. So all of that is a bit of a catch up that's occurring in the plants. In terms of KOB 1, again, the funnel is at $6.5 billion today. It's pretty -- been stable over the last 12, 18 months. We're watching that carefully as we execute the LNG wave we've completed. And there's a few things, obviously, in Qatar that will come our way. So we're watching that carefully. But there that deferred maintenance and the modernization sustainability in digital is what's driving the bulk of the KOB 3 to a large extent for us as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Well, last quarter, you mentioned good confidence and 30% incremental margins for the company for FY '22. Can you update us on your thoughts about incrementals in the current environment? Obviously, the incremental margin in Automation Solutions has been particularly strong. We know the savings benefits of your restructuring program have been flowing through, but the incrementals were so strong in Q1. So is there anything else going on there? And how are you thinking about automation solution incrementals for the rest of the year? Lal Karsanbhai : No, Deane. I think we reiterate that guide of 30% for the business for the year. They had a phenomenal execution in the quarter, it was almost dollar for dollar on the incrementals on automation. But I expect that to normalize as we go through the year, and I think that really guide us. It's the stake in the ground that we put in for our businesses, our expectation that would drive a clear amount of investment back into the business and enable a return back to the shareholders. So that's what we still expect. That's what we have in the financial plan and expect to deliver in the year. Andy Kaplowitz : But love nothing onetime in the quarter per se in that business, right? Lal Karsanbhai : No. No. Andy Kaplowitz : Got it. And then I think your comments were exactly in line with AspenTech management's comments that they mentioned they're seeing some acceleration of final investment decisions for LNG and Middle East oil and gas projects. But they also suggested that they were seeing their refining customers improve their spending. Maybe you could elaborate a bit on what you're seeing in your major energy markets. Are you seeing an acceleration in core North American refining and upstream markets. I think your orders at 19% would imply that, but maybe you can give us a little more color. Lal Karsanbhai : No, absolutely. North America is very strong for us across Automation Solutions right now and it's broad-based. It's a process. I think overall, the oil and gas segment, the outlook is very high single digits as we think about the year. And the CapEx, a lot of that CapEx that we're seeing is driven around those sustainability efforts in production and expect that to be strong. So it's consistent with what AspenTech has seen across the process industries, which has been a bit of a laggard to discrete, obviously, in hybrid that we experienced through 2021. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Can we just get a little bit more specific color, I don't know if you said this earlier on the call, but what you expect the price cost to be in 2Q? And then I guess just you're guiding to an expanded spread there. How much of that spread is from -- I would assume all that spread is from increased price. And ultimately, what's your price capture this year in revenue? Frank Dellaquila : Yes. Steve, this is Frank. So it's -- as we've said before, it's going to improve through the year. We did raise the guide. But again, that guide also -- it does not include the impact of wage and freight. Wage and freight is a significant increase versus the visibility that we had back in November. So much of that increased price that we went out and got is in response to those 2 items. So in terms of how the thing models out, I mean we will turn green on a traditional basis in the second quarter, and then we will continue to ramp the price actions are about 90% in place in terms of the material pass-through that we've expected right from the beginning as well as all the discretionary actions that have been implemented across commercial and residential solutions to offset the NMI, the material inflation, excuse me. So I mean, we see it pretty much as we saw it back in November. And frankly, it's kind of grossed up because we've had to go out and take incremental actions in response to what we're seeing. Steve Tusa : So what's the total price capture for the year now for the -- in revenues percentage-wise? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. I don't think we Frank Dellaquila : Yes. We're not going to go exactly there. I will just tell you that our price capture is at least as good and a little bit more robust than what we talked about back in November in terms of how we model out the year. Steve Tusa : Got it. And then just one quick one on resi. On your resi HVAC business, is there a quarter this year that you're planning to be down on that business as kind of inventory and channel fill? I mean, everything kind of whips around on a volume basis. Lal Karsanbhai : Down relative to where we are today, certainly in the fourth quarter. Steve Tusa : Year-over-year. Year-over-year. Yes. down quarters. Lal Karsanbhai : It could be tight in the fourth quarter, Steve. It would be my take comment. Ram Krishnan : Yes, down volume in the fourth quarter, but will be -- obviously, we're getting price. So I think we'll be right around flat in the fourth quarter from a resi perspective, but down volume. Operator : Next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Just a question about -- on first, what have you learned since you've announced the merger with Aspen about opportunities, not only that Aspen offers but cross-selling opportunities. And a follow-up question also is on systems and software sales. Could you just give some color as to -- it seems from your disclosure revenue growth was only 1%. But can you just give us more color what happened to the assets that are going into Aspen? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. No, look, we continue to be very excited about the commercial opportunities with AspenTech, as you heard from Antonio on the call as well. The commercial agreement is underway. We're working finalizing the last little elements there. The global teams have begun to collaborate. And it's very interesting and even as I made customer calls in Houston 3 weeks ago, engaged at both the Emerson and the AspenTech level in terms of defining opportunities across both businesses. So I think those will come into more clarity as we get closer to close. In terms of the software assets, Ram, if you want to comment on the performance of the assets? Ram Krishnan : Yes. I think the 2 software businesses, GSS and OSI had a very, very good first quarter from an -- orders remain very strong. OSI remains on plan. I think the other point is from a sales growth perspective, which is the number you touted in I think we were up 2% on systems and solutions. And primarily, that was driven by electronic shortages in our systems business, our DeltaV business. Orders, frankly, were strong double digits. So we are seeing good momentum from an order activity as it relates to our systems businesses, both the businesses that we're contributing as well as the ones that will remain within Emerson. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up on Commercial & Residential. How do you think -- what are you seeing from your customers about we've heard of the AHR Expo a lot about sort of product transition towards the year. And how disruptive do you think it's going to be sort of to the optics of shipments, right, because people may not want to have inventory in the channel, there are different regulations. What are you hearing from your customers? And what's the state of the readiness of the industry to manage this transition, given how stressed the supply chains are? Ram Krishnan : Yes. I think, Andrew, as you probably heard at the AHRI, I mean, at this point, all of our customers are telling us do not slow down. Fundamentally, they have immediate demand that we are continuing to satisfy. They're building in safety stock for what will traditionally be a big third quarter in the industry. And more importantly, they want to build up into fourth quarter in advance of the transition that's going to happen Jan 1. So at this point, I think the messaging is do not slow down, and we will continue to see good order activity from our customers over the course of the next few quarters here in preparation for that. I don't think there's going to be a significant inventory build before the transition, but I think demand will not slow down in the fourth quarter like it traditionally does. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : So I just want to go back to the price/cost, Steve's question. Is that 175 still being captured wholly within Com/Res? Or was it spread more across the 2 segments, I think the 100 primarily with Com/Res? Frank Dellaquila : Yes. No, it's actually spread across the business. So we're seeing more of the wage and particularly the freight inflation in commercial/residential, just given the nature of the business. But we're also going out and capturing significant incremental price in automation solutions in response to the mainly, to the electronic component shortage where we are working very hard to get what we need to make product and in some cases, paying significantly more than you normally would pay. So it's pretty balanced and the actions have been significant in automation solutions as well. Nigel Coe : And then on A/S, obviously, the margins that have been touched on already. 1Q is normally the weakest -- or rather the lowest quarter for margins. So I'm just curious, this is not a normal year or anything, but would you still expect 1Q to be the low bar for margins and the sequential improvement from there? Then just on the guide for 7 to 9 to get to the mid- to high end of that range would require a pretty significant ramp-up in the second half of the year. I'm just curious, what does the backlog tell us about the second half? And how much comps do you have in the high end of that range? Frank Dellaquila : Nigel, I think we feel pretty good. Again, everything we say is kind of tempered by the unknowns around logistics and supply chain. Having said that and seeing our operations people basically figure it out as we go through time here, we have good confidence in the upper end of the range for the year. Certainly, the pace of orders in the backlog more than supports that, and it's all about conversion. And we feel very confident in our ability to convert. There's a big ramp in the second half of the year, no doubt, but we've known that from the beginning of the year, both in terms of volume and sales as well as in profitability because of the way the price cost comes through and the price is realized heavily in the second half of the year. So we feel pretty good about it. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : So my apologies if I missed this earlier, but I know you spoke a little bit about KOB 1, roughly $6.5 billion. I'm curious, just more broadly, how are your conversations with customers today, just given the move that we've seen in commodity prices? I just wonder if that funnel is starting to get bigger and the near-term opportunity is more imminent? Lal Karsanbhai : No. Great question, Joe. And I had the opportunity to spend a few days in Houston with customers face-to-face, which is great in the Energy segment, chemical and energy, and the mood is obviously positive. But what's most interesting is how budgets are shifting into the sustainability elements in a very significant way, which is what we've seen in our own funnel, where almost $1 billion now is essentially around those types of electrification. Could be carbonization, emissions, all the sustainability buckets. So that is a significant shift in capital, and I think we'll see that increase over time as we go forward. We see positive move on the large KOB 1s that do remain, whether they're North America-based LNG or Qatar, those are moving forward. We received a number of awards already around our instrumentation and our valve businesses and actuation businesses in Qatar over the last few months. And so we continue to see encouragement there. But I'd suggest, Joe, that the makeup of KOB 1 will start to shift more and more into that sustainability area. Ram, any comments? Ram Krishnan : No, I think well said. I mean, at this point, the number is holding flat at 6.5%, but we could tell you that the pace of FIDs or final investment decisions continue to improve just given the nature of the spend we're seeing with our customers. So we'll see that unravel over the next several quarters. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's helpful. And then my follow-on is just on M&A. Since you clearly, obviously, announced the large acquisition at the end of last year on the software side. I'm just curious, how are you thinking about your pipeline today? There's some assets that seemingly might be coming up on the market. And I'm just curious like where is your focus today? Is there still an emphasis to diversify away from oil and gas? Just any color that you can give us today would be great. Lal Karsanbhai : Sure, Joe. We're very active both on the pluses and minuses. Obviously, our strategic imperatives around diversification is important to create a world-class automation business. So we're very active looking at those. And you're right, the market is active and there are interesting assets out there, and we'll participate accordingly. So we'll stay active. Our balance sheet is in very good shape. I think we have firepower if we' to choose to do other things, and we have that flexibility. So we'll keep -- we'll be smart and very attentive to the opportunities that are out. But we'll also be very intentional as to the pathways that we've defined and we'll speak more about in our Investor Day around the portfolio journey and the targeted verticals that will drive increased value creation through underlying sales growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Markus Mittermaier with UBS. Please go ahead. Markus Mittermaier : If I could come back to the budgets, please. I understand its shifting increasingly to sustainability. As you said, where would you characterize sort of the absolute level of these budgets versus, say, the last cycle peak in '18, '19 sort of -- maybe that's 1 question, trying to get to the total profit pool? And then how easy is it now to get these budgets released when you speak to your customers? Lal Karsanbhai : Okay. Sure. Sure, Markus. I'll be happy to give you some insights. So year-over-year from last year, budgets overall or the size of budgets there up undoubtedly on the KOB 1 side. However, if you look back through time, particularly given the significant LNG wave of investments, they're down because those are very significant capital that was put on outlay to increase capacity of LNG. So they're down on that basis overall. So for us, it's been stabilized from an Emerson Automation value over the last few months and that we'll see as things may potentially expand or particularly around sustainability, as I said earlier. Markus Mittermaier : Okay. Great. And then more final question on the comments around redesign of products. I know  you obviously have to do that given the shortages of parts. But is that also an opportunity from a design to value perspective? Or is there frankly no time to kind of focus on taking cost out of all these products that you have to redesign now anyway? So is it really focused on, okay, I don't have a certain shipment and try to redesign that part? Or can you go beyond that to maybe change structurally, the bill of materials in a number of your products? Ram Krishnan : Great question, Markus. This is Ram here. So I think the short answer is we're doing both. I think the immediate need as we wrestle through component shortages is redesigning to ensure that we have component availability to meet current shipments. However, in the Automation Solutions business, particularly where we have the biggest exposure to electronics, Mark Bulanda and his team are fundamentally redesigning all of the major platforms across automation solutions into next-generation platforms that are fundamentally enhanced performance use more modernized electronic components, upgrading the chips, obviously putting more diagnostics and additional functionality into those platforms. And we're using this opportunity to invest in next-generation platforms that will address what you referenced, better cost, better performance and, frankly, give us more robustness in our supply network design in order to support these products. Now as you know, that will take a little longer, but I think it's important to understand that we're remaining focused on both, manage the short term with immediate redesigns, but then invest in next-generation platforms going forward for the longer term. Operator : Our next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Walsh : Great. Maybe a first question just around China. Obviously, you called out very strong growth there around sustainability, decarb, a lot of stuff happening on the ground there as it relates to potential stimulus. Just are you seeing anything change in China? And how are you thinking about it? Lal Karsanbhai : Look, just to give you a perspective, we have a traditionally very strong business in China, as you know, almost 10,000 employees in China and a business that continues to be incredibly robust. On a destination basis, automation business in China in the quarter was up 17%. The orders, as I think I mentioned, were up 34% in the quarter. So we feel really good. Obviously, we continue to be active in conversations, both governmental and quasi governmental as you could say, to try to influence normalcy of relations with China, but we've continue to feel really good about our position in the marketplace, our ability to win and differentiate and really have loyalty from the customers that are based in China. And our continued acceleration in project participation and growth of our underlying business is, I think, testament to that. Ram? Ram Krishnan : And just to add, I think -- so as Lal described, I think overall, our Automation Solutions businesses remain very robust in China, and I think we expect that to continue. If there's any semblance of a slowdown in China, we've seen it in our appliance businesses, related businesses where we supply sensors. And then our air conditioning business did see a soft first quarter, flat demand, if you will. However, that's where the stimulus and the China stimulating their economy will help in the second half because we expect that to have an impact on our consumer-related businesses. So just to summarize, China, strong automation solutions, expect that to continue, and then we'll wait to see how the stimulus drives fundamental demand in our Climate Technologies business. Lal Karsanbhai : Fair to say that we continue to plan very high single digits, if not low double digits for the year in China from a definition sales performance. John Walsh : Great. And then maybe a similar follow-up to that. If you listen to what some of the kind of integrated energy companies are saying and where they're going to put their CapEx. I mean emissions reductions been mentioned several times. You have product that helped that. Are you actually seeing sales today that can attach that as the reason for why you're getting the sales order? Just thinking about how they have to upgrade their installed base for these -- their own sustainability goals. Lal Karsanbhai : Absolutely, absolutely. And it's broad-based across the energy segment from the producers in traditional upstream like Pioneer to the integrated oils flare elimination, emission reduction, decarbonization, carbon capture programs. And the example -- one of the examples that I shared with you at the offset around emissions was exactly that. So we're -- we can attribute bookings and sales. We have significant pursuits underway across our world areas with our selling organizations around those technologies that are part of our core portfolio that aid our customers in that transition. So we feel really good. Ram, if you've got something to add. Ram Krishnan : Yes. And I think to your point, in terms of the broader scope of technology, whether it's continuous emission monitoring, analytical systems that Lal showed in as an example or the relief valves or other isolation valving associated with emissions monitoring. We've got a very, very good scope of products that can help our customers, and we're certainly seeing a nice uptick on all those product lines as it relates to these type of investments for our customers. Operator : Our next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead. Tommy Moll : I wanted to circle back on the strong implied exit rate for your auto cell business. I think I heard you say earlier that a lot of the visibility there is on backlog conversion. Could you give any insight as to an end market or part of the world that's particularly strong as you see that backlog start to unlock through the rest of the fiscal year? Lal Karsanbhai : Look, I'll give you a perspective from an industry perspective, Tommy, and just from a worldwide perspective for the quarter. The quarter performance globally was relatively strong, but the opportunity really lies in -- from a geographic perspective, in North America and Western Europe from a conversion of backlog perspective. In terms of markets, we expect the process space to be in the high single digits to low double, ultimately, high singles on hybrid as we go through the year and low doubles on discrete as we go through the year. So the discrete strength continues, and then we'll see an acceleration as we go through the process. That's the potential that we see out there. Geographically, I feel really good about where we are. And obviously, as we convert backlog in the developed economies of Europe and U.S., we'll see that benefit. Tommy Moll : And as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the funding on the Aspen deal for the $6 billion cash portion. So you've got nearly $5 billion on the balance sheet today after the recent notes financing and it looks like you monetized part of the Vertiv stake. What are the plans to fund the remainder of that $6 billion? And any chance for a sizable divestiture between now and then that would fill part of that gap? Frank Dellaquila : Tommy, this is Frank. So the plan right now, leaving aside divestitures for the moment, the plan right now is we did $3 billion of term debt in December. We will probably take more cash off the balance sheet than we normally do in a given year to also partially fund and then the balance we intend to do in the commercial paper market. We've had our debt ratings now reaffirmed by Moody's. S&P had done it right from the get-go. So it will be a combination of the $3 billion term debt. Cash on the balance sheet beyond what's on the balance sheet as a function of having done the term debt and then commercial paper. If there is a divestiture and there's no major divestiture in flight right now. But obviously, if there's any divestiture, those proceeds will go towards the cash portion of the purchase. Operator : Last question today will come from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : I'll make it one question because my second was about divestitures, which Frank just addressed. I will -- I'm just wondering if you could give us a little color on actually labor cost and the inflation that you're dealing with. I would assume most of the inflation is in the U.S., but I'm curious if it's spreading to other parts of the world. And can you give us any color on labor as a percent of your COGS or some other framework to think about it? Ram Krishnan : Okay. Yes. This is Ram, Jeff. First off, from an inflation perspective, you're right, U.S. inflation is probably the biggest portion of the inflation, but we have seen inflation in Mexico as well. Mexico, frankly, Jan 1, they increased minimum wage, entry-level wage by 22%. And frankly, this is 1 of 4 minimum wage increases we've seen in Mexico since 2019. So there's issues outside of the U.S. as well, but majority of the inflation is in the U.S. And in our larger compressor plant, for example, we've seen wage inflation, particularly entry-level wages go up by 20% to 25% over a couple of steps. We've had to do that to remain competitive and have the labor availability to work down our backlog. So that's the extent. Normal inflation in some of the other markets we operate, China inflation, India inflation, Europe inflation. Nothing abnormal, normal levels of inflation in those markets. So the abnormal levels we're seeing are particularly in the U.S. and some, Mexico. Jeff Sprague : And can you size labor as a percent of COGS, maybe Frank? Ram Krishnan : DL is about 9 -- high single digits... Frank Dellaquila : Obviously, a little higher in Climate Tech & Commercial Residential and a little lower in Automation Solutions, but high single digits on the profit waterfall as a percent of sales. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session, and this will also conclude the conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brian Joe. Please go ahead, sir. Brian Joe : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Emerson's Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; Chief Financial Officer, Frank Dellaquila; and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Please join me on Slide 2. This presentation may include forward-looking statements, which contain a degree of business risk and uncertainty. Please take time to read the safe harbor statement and note on the non-GAAP measures. Turning to Slide 3. As noted in our press release, Emerson officially announced the date and location of our 2022 investor conference. The conference will be held in person November 29 in New York City. More details will be distributed as we approach the conference later this year. I'll now turn the presentation over to Emerson's President and CEO, Lal Karsanbhai, for his opening remarks. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. I would like to begin by thanking the global Emerson team, who again delivered very strong results amid challenging operating conditions. I'd also like to thank and extend my appreciation to Emerson's Board of Directors for their energy and support of management. And lastly, to all our shareholders who believe in our value creation proposition, thank you. A lot has changed since our call three months ago. Operating conditions clearly worsened, the war in Ukraine, COVID lockdowns in China, resulted in a return to inflationary commodity environment, lead time extensions and shortages in electronics and logistics challenges. All this resulted in challenging variances across our businesses. But in spite of this, our business performance was strong, and we delivered differentiated results in our ability to execute. Orders grew 13% on a March ending three-month underlying basis, led by 17% growth in Automation Solutions and 7% growth in commercial, residential. Our underlying sales accelerated to 10% growth with conversion in Automation Solutions improving sequentially to 7%; and commercial, residential, very strong at 14% growth. We have broad world area strength across our business. Price activity was very robust in the quarter, and it is sticking. But it is largely offsetting inflationary impact of materials, labor and freight costs. We delivered incremental profitability of 24% in the quarter and remained committed to our guideline of 30% for the year. Earnings per share on an adjusted basis grew 21% to $1.29, $1.21 excluding an $0.08 impact that came in the quarter. Bottom line, yes, it is challenging, but our operating diligence, our management process enabled this performance. I'm very proud of the team. Going forward, we see a robust industrial environment, led by energy investments in North America and the Middle East. The war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia has brought North America gas back to life. Reshoring, which many of us have talked about, which at this point has been largely discussed in relation to discrete manufacturing, can and should be now fully valued as it relates to energy, specifically LNG. And Emerson is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this trend. However, I should state that our perspective on energy remains unchanged. We will continue to divest, commoditized, upstream oil and gas businesses. We have two processes currently in the market. Sustainability investments are core to our customer success, and the unprecedented gas wave will serve both to shore up gas as a transitionary energy source and eliminate European dependence on Russian gas. Lastly, the technology stack that we can now bring to market, the best-in-class intelligent devices, a highly differentiated control system topology and the industry's leading software offering with AspenTech, place Emerson in a unique position to succeed. Our KOB 1 funnel grew to nearly $7 billion in the quarter, up almost $0.5 billion, with sustainability projects reaching $1 billion in value within that funnel. Demand in our climate business remained strong across most segments in the mid-single-digit range. We continue to work closely with our HVAC OEM customers, as we navigate through challenging inflationary environments. And I appreciate the efforts that carrier and train, in particular, have made to enable us to pass along price actions. The future of this business is bright. We will watch the current residential cycle carefully, but over the medium term, we're well positioned to capitalize on our ESG trends through more efficient systems, new refrigerant standards and the acceleration of heat pump adoption in Europe. Our professional tools and home products business continued to benefit from strong commercial demand, although residential demand has weakened in the quarter. And we attribute much of that to the fact that household disposable income cannot readily be applied to other activities in lieu of home improvements, and we're watching that carefully. Nevertheless, we have strong backlog positions in that business, which will enable us to deliver strong results for the year. Our confidence enables the raising guide we gave today of $0.05 on the bottom, which is at $4.95 or 10% growth and the top to $5.10 or 13% growth over 2021. Regarding cash flow, we remain committed to 100% conversion in 2022. Within this guide is the operational impact from our decision to exit our Russia business, which we announced today. This includes the sale of our Metran subsidiary. We will also continue to make progress on our portfolio journey, with the TOD divestiture expected to close in this current quarter and Aspen shareholder meeting scheduled for May 16, with close expected the same day. We're very excited and I remain excited about working with Antonio to build a unique, highly differentiated industrial software company. Lastly, I would like to say a few words about our people. Our culture work is underway and we are developing a talent philosophy, which will be highly differentiated and enable Emerson to attract and retain the best. A lot of great work on the way by the team on this front as well. With that, please turn to slide 5. We continue to see strong levels of demand across both platforms, as I indicated. I'll start with a few comments on Commercial & Residential Solutions, which trailing three-month orders were up 7%. We are still seeing broad strength across both Climate and Tools and Home Products as we hit both comparable results versus -- hit strong comparable results versus a year ago. Within Climate Tech, European resi and commercial heating markets continue to be strong, and Asian decarbonization trends are gaining momentum from government support. As expected, US resi demand began to moderate and as we went through the quarter, but remains positive in the Americas as we entered the peak cooling season. For the tools business, as I mentioned, commercial and industrial momentum continues, while residential began to slow. And we'll watch that very, very carefully, particularly the DIY rates as we go through this quarter. The trailing three-month orders for Automation Solutions were up 17% from the prior year, and that's indicative of the continued strength across process, hybrid and discrete. Within hybrid, life science investments remain strong globally, while metals and mining investments and resurgent -- are resurging, particularly in the southern cone of America, of Latin America and in Africa. In the discrete space, supply chain driven segments like semiconductor and electronics are on track for 20-plus percent year-over-year growth, while factory and machine automation maintained strong momentum. Process markets continue to gain momentum with chemical utilization improving and power market strength through renewables and grid modernization. We also see continued oil and gas spend, as I mentioned, led by US shale investments. Upstream CapEx is up double digit year-over-year despite reinvestment rates near record lows at 40%. We're in the beginning of a strong growth cycle. And I expect to see continued investments in key regions and in decarbonization initiatives. As oil prices rose, we saw more activity around key energy segments such as LNG, clean fuels and renewables. And let me share a little more color with you on these markets on the next slide, page 6. Just to give a perspective on what we're seeing in terms of LNG, which we highlight here, the US opportunity on the left side of the chart. If you think about the LNG way from 2000 to 2010, which is predominantly driven by the Middle East, we saw 125 MTPAs of invest, one million tons per annum capacity come online during that wave. In the 2011 to 2021 wave, which had a US component, a Russia component and an Australia component predominantly, another 125 MTPAs came online. We currently expect a 2022 plus forward a wave that we're now entering and is being funded to result in 250 MTPAs of investment, of which 150 already underway with an incremental 100 coming online over the next few years. So a very exciting period of time here as we think about gas, not just liquefaction, which will impact Middle East and US predominantly, but then the regasification and tanker investments that are required to get the gas into Europe through this segment. On the right-hand side of this chart, Emerson continues to play a pivotal role as traditional energy players and new entrants begin to focus on new energy segments such as clean fuels and renewables. Our decarbonization and sustainability funnel grew to $1 billion in the quarter as energy companies are dedicating roughly 15% of their CapEx budgets to these projects. In clean fuels, Emerson was recently chosen as the main automation partner for the world's largest renewable diesel facility and will supply key digital offerings as part of this project. Emerson also expanded its role in renewable energy through its acquisition of Media Technique and American Governor acquisitions, which also have and also through some technology investments in the core portfolio. In the second quarter, Emerson Geological Simulation Software was selected to provide its geological and reservoir modeling software to HITA, a geothermal energy company in Belgium to increase the safety and reliability of geothermal energy sources. This is an exciting example of a traditional Emerson application designed for the oil and gas field now expanding to a diversified sustainability application. And then lastly, Emerson was selected as a software and controls provider for the world's largest battery storage facility, another high-growth area where Emerson brings immediate relevance.  And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Frank to go through the second quarter results. Frank Dellaquila : Thank you, Lal, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. If you would, please turn to Slide 7 and I'll review the quarter. As Lal said, we had a very strong quarter. I want to also extend my thanks to everyone in operations for the execution that they turned in and have faced some very real operational challenges. Demand continues to be robust across most key end markets, driving second quarter underlying growth of 10%, ahead of the guidance that we provided in February. The higher sales were partially driven by price actions and realizations that were implemented to offset continued inflation. I will talk a little bit more about the price inflation dynamic when we address the guidance. For the quarter, we realized four points of price overall, and we did turn positive with respect to net material inflation as we said we would.  Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 20 basis points as we more than offset additional material costs and other inflation, which was significant, with increased price and effective cost management. SG&A performance was excellent. We leveraged it. It was essentially flat in dollars in Q2 versus last year and was leveraged two points across the enterprise, reflecting previous restructuring actions and spending restraint in the businesses. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.29, up 21% versus prior year, exceeding the February guide of $1.15 to $1.20. As Lal mentioned, it includes an $0.08 tax benefit in the quarter. That benefit was included in the 22% tax rate guide for the year, but the timing of when we would see it in the year was uncertain. We had it \u2013 we actually realized it in the second quarter.  Free cash flow was down 50% versus prior year. This is mainly due to higher inventory as a result of defensive stocking due to supply chain constraints, finished goods awaiting shipment and of course, higher expected sales in the second half of the year. Nonetheless, we have a challenge. And while we believe, this is timing-related and we will get on top of it over the course of the year, we expect conversion to improve significantly in the second half. Turning to the platform results. Both businesses executed extremely well. Automation solution underlying sales were up 7%, led by the Americas and China. Price realized in the quarter was 2%. All key end markets showed strength, and KOB 3 activity continues to be strong, remaining at 60% of sales. Backlog increased by $400 million in the quarter to $6.4 billion, due to the strong pace of orders, which gives us confidence in the year-end and positions us very well into 2023. Operations have adjusted to longer lead times for critical production inputs, and they continue to effectively mitigate logistics constraints and other challenges. We expect our ability to execute orders in backlog to improve throughout the balance of the fiscal year. Automation Solutions adjusted EBITDA improved 170 basis points versus prior year on leverage, price realization and cost control, despite higher general inflation and significant cost increases for electronic components in the quarter. We experienced a sharp cost increase in the second quarter with respect to electronics that has been addressed by price actions and that will be recovered over the balance of the year. The strong operational performance in the platform is reflected in 55% leverage for the quarter. Another very, very strong operational quarter. Commercial & Residential Solutions also performed well operationally under a similar, but somewhat different set of challenges. Underlying sales increased 14%, including 9 points of price realization in the quarter. Price, less net material inflation, did turn slightly positive in the second quarter, as we said it would, and it is on the trajectory that we said we would be on when we described this in the last call. Sales were up double digits in all world areas, except China, where they declined slightly in part due to the lockdowns across the country. Commercial and industrial markets remained strong. North American resi grew well in the quarter. We are beginning to see some signs of moderation there. In tools and home products, service, industrial and online channel sales remain strong. There are some indications of slowing in the retail channel as do-it-yourself projects begin to be impacted by the inflationary environment and the diversion of people's attention to other things as the economy opens up. Backlog increased $100 million in the quarter, mainly in Climate Technologies. Adjusted EBITA was down 230 basis points, consistent with our expectations going into the quarter. As I said, price less net material inflation was slightly positive in the quarter, remained margin-dilutive, and additional price was realized, but was offset by freight inflation and above-normal wage costs. Please turn to page eight for the EPS walk. Adjusted EPS was $1.29, up 21% and exceeding the top end of the guidance range by $0.09, including an $0.08 tailwind from the discrete tax item. Adjusted EPS was also negatively impacted by $0.04 due to prior year one-time gains, the delta that is, was impacted. Again, as a reminder, adjusted EPS excludes intangibles amortization, restructuring, transaction costs related to the AspenTech transaction and first year purchase accounting charges. Operations in total leveraged at nearly 25% and contributed $0.11 to adjusted EPS versus the prior year. So before we go to the guidance, I'm going to turn this over to Ram, so he can provide an update on the operational and supply chain challenges that the businesses continue to face. Ram? Ram Krishnan : Thank you, Frank. Please turn to slide 10. Clearly, like the last few quarters, the operating environment has remained challenging, as electronic supply, commodity inflation and logistics constraints continue to impact our operations globally. Additionally, geopolitical uncertainty and COVID lockdowns in China introduced new challenges as we exited Q2 and began the third quarter. On the commodities front, the current geopolitical environment has led to rising steel, nonferrous commodities and oil prices, causing incremental inflation on a large portion of our material purchases. This has been a significant reversal in course for some commodities such as steel. Due to the magnitude of the increases, additional material inflation will be incurred as we progress through the second half. Price actions already in place, and the additional ones underway will keep our price less material inflation positive for the second half of the fiscal year, but will constrain margins in our climate business. Higher oil prices have also led to increased logistics costs. This again reiterates the importance of our regionalization strategy, which allows us to leverage our strong regional supply bases and largely avoid expensive intercontinental logistics. On the electronics side, component availability remains a concern, especially within Automation Solutions. While we see stabilization of lead times, the market is expected to remain tight well into 2023 as capacity additions are not able to keep up with demand. Continued purchase price variances are also impacting profitability, although our proactive price increases help ease the impact. Our global teams continue to do outstanding work to qualify additional suppliers and redesign products to utilize available components, and we\u2019re clearly seeing the benefit of this effort come through. Lastly, the China COVID lockdowns continue to be a fluid situation. The impacts to our second quarter were minimal, but these lockdowns are expected to have a bigger impact heading into Q3. The current issues are contained to our plant operations in Shanghai, but we are beginning to see constraints to our plant operations across the country due to supplier shutdowns. We're keeping a close eye on the situation and will adapt as necessary. While we expect to face headwinds in many of these areas for the rest of the year, we're confident, very confident, that our global teams will deliver differentiated operational execution in a challenging environment as evidenced by our strong first half performance. I will now turn the call back over to Frank. Frank Dellaquila : Thank you, Ram. If you would, please turn to slide 11, and we'll go through the outlook for the year. So as Lal mentioned at the top of the call, we continue to see very strong demand across nearly all businesses and world areas that challenges our operational challenges. They are not challenges around the basic demand across the enterprise. Automation Solutions is strengthening across process, hybrid and discrete markets. In process markets, recent events will drive incremental investments across the energy value chain. This strengthening demand will spur growth in transition markets like LNG and emerging markets like clean fuels, battery storage and renewables, as well as in traditional oil and gas markets as Lal discussed. Together with continued robust demand in chemicals, power gen and grid modernization, we are increasing our outlook for the process market growth in 2022 to high single digits. We also expect hybrid demand to remain strong at mid to high single digits, including continued life science investments and high commodity prices, boosting metals and mining CapEx. Discrete markets remain strong in the 10% range with semiconductor, electronics and factory automation investments are all strong. So while we're encouraged by the underlying demand situation, there are constraints, as Ram outlined, remaining -- regarding supply chain, logistics and potentially COVID in China, which is an evolving situation. It's already had somewhat of an impact in the quarter, and there's uncertainty as to how that will unfold. In particular, we expect challenges to continue around electronics availability, and we expect that to continue into 2023. Continued strength in our core markets, our backlog level and orders momentum provide the underpinning for strong second half sales growth, and we will have to deal with those challenges as they evolve. Overall, we have confidence in our fiscal year sales guide for Automation Solutions despite these challenges and we also have included in the guide the reduction in volume related to the exit from our Russian business, as Lal described at the top of the call. In Commercial & Residential Solutions, we expect continued double-digit sales growth for the third quarter and full year. Demand continues to be strong against resi and commercial businesses. In Climate Tech, residential growth is supported by European heating markets and by new product launches currently underway for the 2023 US regulation changes. Climate commercial and industrial growth is also supported by the European and Asian heating markets. Tools & Home Products retail sales are expected to moderate due to the effect of consumer inflation, as I said earlier. However, continued industrial momentum will benefit the Professional Tools business. Please turn to slide 12 for the outlook. We are increasing our underlying sales range by two points to 9% to 11%, driven by the demand outlook and by incremental price versus the prior guide. Automation Solutions guide will remain at 7% to 9%. As discussed on the previous slide, we're increasing our underlying sales expectation for commercial and residential to 12% to 14%, and this is substantially attributable to incremental price being realized in the business. We continue to expect to see tailwinds for price less net material inflation in the second half as we previously communicated. This is the traditional price/cost relationship that we have always discussed in the context of this business. This year is different. We are seeing significant inflation in other cost areas, and we are implementing significant additional mitigating price actions to protect profits. These actions, however, constrain or dilute margins. For this reason, we're going to talk about price less net material generally as price/cost, as we have described in the past, doesn't really capture the breadth of the inflation challenge. I want to point out that we are realizing more than 100% of the material-driven price that was in our and we are implementing actions to offset resurgent material costs as well as the other elements of inflation. We're achieving substantial price realization for 2022, but that overall inflation dynamic pressures incremental margins in commercial and residential. We will continue to drive for 30% incrementals for the year for total operations, but we'll probably get there differently than we thought we would even three months ago with stronger leverage in Automation Solutions and pressure on the leverage in commercial/residential due to the price inflation equation. The other elements of the guide, tax, dividend, and share repurchase remain the same as they were in February. Operating cash flow is now expected to be $3.6 billion due mainly to the increased inventory resulting from supply chain constraints as well as some other balance sheet timing issues. We are absorbing within this guide as well $100 million of tax payments associated with the Vertiv gain that we booked in the first quarter under GAAP fees run through operating cash flow, although they really are related to the financing cash flow that we realized when we booked the gain in the first quarter. Free cash flow is now $3 billion and represents approximately 100% conversion for 2022 after converting at 130% last year. The GAAP EPS guide is updated for our improved sales outlook, and as a reminder, includes two items related to the AspenTech transaction, both estimated transaction fees and interest expense on the $3 billion of term debt we issued in December in anticipation of the closing. The adjusted EPS guide moves up $0.05 at the bottom and the top to $4.95 to $5.10. Inside this guide, we're absorbing the estimated impact to operating profits related to the reduction of our Russia business, but we have not included any other potential cost or charging result -- or charges, pardon me, resulting from the exit which are not yet known with any precision. Also to be clear, no estimate of the operational impact of AspenTech is included in these guidance numbers nor is the future gain or tax impact of the TOD divestiture, which is expected to close this quarter. Turning to Slide 13. I'll cover the third quarter. Q3 2022 net sales growth is expected to be 7% to 9%, underlying sales growth between 9% and 11%. We expect Automation Solutions underlying sales in the range of 7% to 9%; commercial and residential, between 13% to 15%. GAAP EPS is expected to be between $1 and $1.05; and adjusted EPS, between $1.25 and $1.30 on the same basis I described for the year. I want to point out that this guide considers the current environment and challenges that the businesses are navigating, including the COVID shutdown, the continued electronic shortages. We're one month into the quarter, and these are very real impacts on the quarter. We intend to work through them. And assuming that the critical uncontrollable variables likely stabilize or improve, we would be well positioned to deliver a very good third quarter and then a very strong fourth quarter to close out the year. And with that, we will open it up for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begun the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : I want to maybe start off with China today, like I saw that you saw double-digit growth in Automation Solutions. I'm just curious, how did that trend through the quarter? And then what are you kind of factoring in for the lockdowns and the impacts associated with that in your guidance? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. I'll speak to the business activity, Joe, and just focusing on your question around auto sol. Very strong quarter and -- both in sales conversion but also in orders when you look at the destination business, both in the mid-teens, high to mid-teens. So we feel very strong about the activity in infra auto sol. The commercial/residential activity is somewhat more muted, driven by the climate resi cycle. And those orders were softer as we went through the quarter. But when I look at the project activity, when I look at the installed base momentum we have in China, I see the outlook -- I continue to feel very strong about the outlook for the year, Joe, for us. In terms of sales conversion, Ram, if you want to speak to it. Ram Krishnan : Yes. So Joe, I think, obviously, we've got 20 plants across China, and we have a few around Shanghai, where we have experienced constraints in the last four weeks. Hopefully, as we go into the month of May, we're starting to see those open up. We partially opened up in the Shanghai area this week. Clearly, we have supply chain across China that supplies us that have been impacted. We are expecting that situation to improve as we go through the quarter. April was a tough month for us, but we do believe that as the \u2013 we built in improving situations through the quarter, and that's kind of baked into the guidance. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Great. That's helpful. If I could ask a follow-on question, and apologies if I missed it earlier. But in C&RS, I know that, there was an original assumption that we could potentially see flat to slightly up margins in 2022. Just help us understand how that \u2013 how you expect the margins in that business to expand in the second half of the year. And then any commentary on price/cost in C&RS would be helpful. Frank Dellaquila : Yeah. Joe, good morning, this is Frank. So the margins will improve sequentially in the second half as we've expected all along based on the price/cost, the incremental price, that will come through. The price is back-end loaded for the year in Climate Tech. Year-over-year we are struggling to get to a push because of the incremental inflation in the business. So the business will deliver EBIT dollars, strong increase in EBIT dollars year-over-year and consistent with what we thought we would do at the beginning of the year, but the incremental inflation and the price that the business is going out to cover dilutes margins. Joe Ritchie : That makes sense, Frank. Yeah. Thank you. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Joe. Operator : The next question will come from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys. Good morning. Lal Karsanbhai : Hey, Steve. Frank Dellaquila : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Sorry, I was on the speaker there. Just on the orders, you noted some signs of moderation in residential on the C&RS side. Any other part of the order trends where there was a bit of a standout in terms of either slowing or accelerating? Any real kind of standouts on the order front on kind of a sequential monthly basis? Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah, Steve. No, good question. No, beyond the \u2013 we're watching the resi very carefully, obviously, not just the climate side but on the home tools side and watching for traffic through our big-box partners there. But beyond that, look, the strength in automation continues. I think we're energized by seeing the capital project funnel grow and the opportunities there. KOB 3 continues to be very strong, 60% in the quarter for Automation Solutions. That's been the engine in that business. But now with a KOB 1 and 2 wave coming at us, feel very robust about the outlook there. Beyond that, nothing else to comment. Ram? Ram Krishnan : No. And Steve, I think the European heat pump business remains strong, very, very strong. And actually, our North American HVAC residential business also remains strong. Steve Tusa : Okay. So it's more in kind of the resi side of tools, if you will? Ram Krishnan : Correct. Steve Tusa : Yeah. Okay. Great. Thanks a lot guys. Appreciate it. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Steve. Operator : The next question will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Good morning, everyone. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : A couple of things. I mean, just if we want to go back to chip availability, I mean, you guys were a little bit more confident, I think, last quarter in supply and demand matching up perhaps by the back half of the year. Has this just shifted to the right? And I guess another way to ask it is, are you less confident today than you were three months ago? Lal Karsanbhai : I will let Ram give its perspective, but my perspective is, its gotten tougher. We have to for quarter, get more creative, qualify different suppliers, go into the open market which all of that creates variability, variances in the P&L and challenges. But -- so that's versus where we were essentially three months ago. But having said that, we'll have to watch China carefully as we go through here, through the month of April and May and watch how \u2013 what happens in the supply chain there. But that's how I feel about it. It certainly didn't get better between the China COVID lockdowns and obviously the war in Ukraine. Ram? Ram Krishnan : Yes. And particularly on the electronics or the chip shortages, lead times have stabilized, but they are running at 3x of pre-COVID levels. And so, we're managing in that environment. The piece that we thought would improve was component shortages, but the \u2013 but we continue to fight shortages on a weekly basis that are impacting our businesses. And hopefully, we'll start to see that improve over the next several weeks. But at this point, we had hoped to see improvement in the shortages, and we haven't. Scott Davis : That's super helpful. And then other SKUs, are -- is it a different list of stuff this quarter? Is it the same list of stuff that's hard to get or a different list? Is it changing, or is there more stability there across the board? Ram Krishnan : I would say it's similar, I mean, similar type of components that we use primarily in our Automation Solutions business and some parts of our commercial and residential business. So, I wouldn't say it's changing. But I would say, I think the shortages are not improving. Scott Davis : Okay. Thank you. I will pass it on. Operator : The next question will come from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Hi, guys how are you? Ram Krishnan : Hey Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just based on the relative increase in revenue and EPS, it seems like \u2013 and this is our math, I apologize. This is like 2/3 additional price that just offsets high inflation. But there seems to be a 1/3 of the increase, which is real volume growth with normal incrementals. So first is that characterization, right? And second, where was the stronger volume? Frank Dellaquila : So Andrew, I don't know if it's exactly 2/3 or 1/3. I think generally, the characterization is right, that most of the increase in the revenue forecast is price, with pressures margins. But there is some underlying volume increase as well. It comes through a very strong underlying leverage actually when you factor out the inflation items. Andrew Obin : But what end markets specifically? Frank Dellaquila : Automation. Ram Krishnan : Yes. Automation. Frank Dellaquila : Yes. Automation Solutions, yes. And residential, it's, I would say, almost entirely price-driven at this point. Andrew Obin : Got you. And a follow-up, just going back to chip availability. There's a lot of talk about capacity -- trailing-edge capacity coming on in the US maybe in six months at places like Texas Instruments, Intel. What kind of conversations are you having with those guys? And when do you think you're actually able -- instead of going through brokers and redesign and sort of struggling with the supply chain, how long do you think it takes for real incremental sort of lower capacity to become available in North America from core manufacturers? Is it six months, or is it more like 18 months to two years? Thank you. Ram Krishnan : Yes. So Andrew, great question. First off, to answer the first part, we are in really good dialogue with suppliers like Texas Instruments, which are very important -- NXP, TI are important suppliers to us on this exact same discussion. We believe that, particularly for our types of chips that go into our Automation Solutions product offering, it's nine to 12 months is the time line for when we expect the capacity to come online or at least that's really when the discussions we've been having with the likes of TI. So that's really what's being planned. We expect the constraints to last at least until then. But hopefully, in nine to 12 months, we'll see that capacity impact lead times. Andrew Obin : So early calendar '23? Ram Krishnan : Yes. Andrew Obin : Thank you so much. Ram Krishnan : Thank you. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : The next question will come from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning everyone. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning. Ram Krishnan : Good morning. Andy Kaplowitz : Maybe can you talk about how your Automation Solution customers are thinking about large projects at this point? Obviously, commodity prices are more supportive. You talked about energy independence and LNG, but there's also higher inflation, higher rates. So how do you think the CapEx cycle plays out here? And what are your customers saying about moving forward with these bigger KOB1 investments? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. Good question, Andy. So, twofold. One, there continues to be strong support both inside the Boardroom and in actual spend around sustainability investments. Those continue to be funded. There's a lot of creativity in terms of what they are and how they're being implemented. And that's reflected in our funnel itself growing now to about a semblance of the total KOB funnel. So very relevant there. And I feel confident and how those continue to move forward. On other CapEx, what we've seen and the biggest change we've seen as we went through the quarter was gas. And the conversation around gas really we're 71 days into the war, and that's only accelerated. And the opportunities in -- particularly in three places : in Qatar, in Louisiana and in Texas. We had a significant amount of work, engineering work that was done pre-pandemic around investments in LNG in Louisiana, in Texas. A lot of those were shelved. The good news is a lot of that engineering has been completed, and we're seeing a number of those coming back into play now with FID activities across a lot of those. So that would be the biggest change in acceleration in the funnel, and I think that plays very well. Obviously, gas for us is a very significant opportunity as we go forward. Ram, anything to add? Ram Krishnan : Yes. I would just add, we are seeing more ethylene, methanol projects being talked through. And frankly, globally, some refining capacity coming online entering our $7 billion project funnel. So I think good activity across the board. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks. And maybe just following up on LNG then. You mentioned 150 MTPA is already underway, and there could be 100 more. But how much of the work is actually in your backlog at this point or burning through your revenue right now? How long -- how do you think the cycle will play out? And when do you think will be the peak impact on Emerson's businesses? Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah. Look, the opportunity, let's say, size it at about $1 billion if you size it in total, and you can divide that over five years, I think it's fair to say into Emerson revenue, Andy. As you know, the cycle on construction is four to five years for each of these jobs. So take the $1 billion automation number that I essentially laid out for the 100 and divide it by five. Now what that doesn't include, in my opinion, is the regasification opportunities, which we'll see in Europe, in Germany, in places like Italy and Poland and the tankers and freighters. So that's in addition to this. But about fair. If you just did the math at $80 million per five MTPAs, that's how we'd size that. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreicate it guys. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you. Frank Dellaquila : Thanks. Operator : The next question will come from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning guys. Lal Karsanbhai : Hi Josh. Frank Dellaquila : Hi Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : So just to follow-up on Andy's question there. Just, kind of, wondering with this new project upcycle and a lot has changed in the industry and your business and the way the customers are approaching these things, a lot more digital, is there less of anything as you guys think about the bill of materials on the project? Is there something where maybe like a digital asset is replacing a physical one? Because it seems like the opportunity or the build material should be higher. I'm just wondering like if there's anything that gets smaller as we enter this like KOB 1/2 upcycle. Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah. No, it's a great question. I'll let Ram give his thoughts as well. But look, what we do see is an increase in use of analytics and software on top of the stack. And if you think about the capabilities that an asset optimization software capability like AspenTech brings to the table, that's increasingly more relevant as far as the bill of materials for these customers. So that would be the biggest change. You still got to use farm control elements. You still have to sense what goes through pipes. You're talking about very strenuous conditions of pressure and temperature. And ultimately, you still have to control the recipe with a control system. But the analytics layer and optimizing the performance of the process, I think, is where we see increasing more spend. Ram? Ram Krishnan : You're spot on. I think, obviously, the LNG wave is just going to be, from a content perspective, just as attractive as the prior waves for us with additional software that Lal mentioned. And then if you look at the sustainability wave around biofuels, hydrogen, et cetera, the content there is just as rich as what you would get in a chemical facility. So net-net, we don't see anywhere the content getting smaller. In general, it will just get augmented with more software data and analytics in addition to the mechanical and the instrumentation content that we typically have. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. Because these projects are longer cycle, do you guys have anything in terms of price escalators or indexing that you're putting in the contracts to protect yourself on the inflation side? Thanks. Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah. No. Look, these are very detailed commercial agreements that we ultimately enter, and most do have some kind of inflation protection elements there on material. But keep in mind, obviously, on elements like control and software, there's very little material to speak of. So it'd be more on the final control side that we really work those very, very hard. Josh Pokrzywinski : Perfect. Thanks. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks. Operator : The next question will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please, go ahead. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning, Deane. Frank Dellaquila : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Hey. I know Aspen close is coming up soon. What are the plans right out of the gate? Do you have any like 100-day goals that you could share? Ram Krishnan : Yes. So Deane, this is Ram here. Yes, great question. Obviously, we've been planning -- we've had plenty of time to plan for day one, particularly as it relates to integration and channel plans that have been thought through in great detail. So a lot of it, day one will really focus on getting the sales organization going on the sales synergies, which on a global basis is a significant part of the pieces. So, yes, the answer is, yes. Secondly, I mean, obviously, there's lots of opportunities on the technology front and a lot of dialogue underway there as well on the technology collaboration, which will be longer term, as it plays out. But certainly on the sales integration front, we're ready day one to get going. Deane Dray : That's great to hear. And then, any comments on April? Anything specific that you could share? Lal Karsanbhai : No. Look, I think the trends we talked about that impacted us in March, the COVID lockdowns in China, we continue to work through those. But beyond that, we're positive on the demand side of the equation through April, very positive. Deane Dray : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please, go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Lal Karsanbhai : Hey, good morning, Nigel. Frank Dellaquila : Hi, Nigel. Ram Krishnan : Hi, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Can you hear me? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. Frank Dellaquila : Yes. Ram Krishnan : Yes. Yes, yes. Nigel Coe : Yes. Okay. Great. Thank you. So look, AS margin -- incremental margin is extremely strong, I think 57%, if my calculations are correct and came in better than you expected. I think you were pointing towards maybe some sequential moderation from 1Q. So just curious, what's driving the upside and the strength in the incremental margins? And how do you see that over the balance of the year? Frank Dellaquila : Yes. So, hi, Nigel, this is Frank. What we're seeing here is, all the hard -- coming to fruition all the hard work that was done in this business over two or three years. We don't talk about peak margin anymore, but I mean, this is the result of that effort. So despite incremental -- other kinds of inflation, despite even some NMI, which is unusual in the business to this extent, they're printing very, very strong incrementals, because the basic cost structure of that business has been reset. So the incrementals were extremely strong in Q1, and again, as you say, mid-50s in Q2, and we expect they'll continue to be strong in the balance of the year. Nigel Coe : And then, obviously, the dollar is moving around a fair bit here. And sometimes, we have seen some FX impact moving around the AS margins. Is that a factor at all here? Frank Dellaquila : No. Not really. No, not significantly. Not a material impact. Nigel Coe : And then, my follow-on for Lal on the portfolio. Obviously, you've been very vocal about diversifying away from upstream oil and gas. Do you feel the change in tone around engine security? The US administration stands towards NG CapEx, natural gas, et cetera. Do you feel that you have more headroom and maybe some more time to design the portfolio diversification moves? Lal Karsanbhai : No. Look, as I said at the offset, Nigel, I remain committed to diversification in the company. We're working actively on the portfolio management. And obviously, we'll talk at length in our November investor conference about the subject in terms of vision, and hopefully, some very meaningful steps. The commoditized element of oil and gas -- upstream oil and gas assets, we're continuing to work that very aggressively in the market. But in terms of the differentiated technology that is applicable not just in gas, but in life sciences and in many of our other markets, we remain committed to. And we remain committed to the investments around gas because I do believe if you just look at that energy equation that -- as a transitionary fuel over time, that's going to be required for the world to meet its needs. Nigel Coe : Okay, great. Thanks. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, sir. Operator : The next question will come from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead. Tommy Moll : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning Tommy. Tommy Moll : Digging on the topic of auto sol incrementals, I wanted to talk about pricing dynamics for your oil and gas business. Potentially, you've been able to pass through some inflationary items. But if we really think about net price, my assumption would be you started the year from a pretty low base just given the severe downturn in the recent past. But as we think through to back half of this year or really even next year, is there not an embedded call option on price here? I mean you've got a commodity environment that's got to be a tailwind. You've got record cash balances, margins, profitability, et cetera, across your customer base. Should we be fairly bullish on that front? Lal Karsanbhai : Look, are you speaking specifically about Automation Solutions, Tommy? We continue to -- we have a long history of positive price activity in that market. And that comes from a basis of not just the market structure, but the relevance of our technology in the space and our ability to differentiate and drive price, obviously, is meaningful there. So, look, in some cases, we're up to four price increases across that space. We're working very actively through our selling organizations and with our end users. But I remain confident in that business of ability not just to continue to implement price as needed, but for it also to be realized into the P&L. Frank, anything? Frank Dellaquila : Yes, Tommy, that business captures price year in and year out. It's a very strong business with respect to its ability to capture value through pricing. The commodity situation, with the exception of this unusual electronics situation, it's not nearly as impactful in that business as it is on the other side of the business. So I mean, typically, even with these kinds of broad commodity swings, while yes, they have a P&L impact, it's not determinative. Right now, it's the electronics. That really is the incremental variable that we are dealing with in terms of pricing, but there's no significant embedded price to come as a result of what's going on now. The pricing power in that business is very steady. We're stepping it up this year because we have an unusual situation. Ram Krishnan : Yes. And just to add to that, commodities as a makeup of the cost structure of that business is not a big element of the cost structure. So -- but as Frank said, we've traditionally been green price/cost, and we'll continue to be green price/cost as we get into the second half of the year. Tommy Moll : Thank you. That's helpful. And then shifting gears, I wanted to circle back to the outlook for resi HVAC. You gave some context that the trends may be slowing there and there's certainly been a lot of focus, at least in terms of the North America trends year-to-date and for the back half. So what additional insight could you give us there in terms of what you're seeing in -- on underlying demand? Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah. Look, residential as a whole, particularly reflected in our home products business has weakened as we went through the quarter. And we've seen that in just the order run rates. Our climate business has remained strong to date. And as we get into the season, we'll watch how that translates, but feel pretty good about on the climate side still, Tommy. Tommy Moll : Thank you. I\u2019ll turn it back. Operator : The next question will come from Brendan Luecke with AllianceBernstein. Please go ahead. Brendan Luecke : Morning all. Thanks for taking the question. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning, Brendan. Frank Dellaquila : Good morning. Brendan Luecke : Circling back to the Russia question. Can you offer some color on the size of that business, what the impact is to point out for the guide on the year in Automation Solutions? Frank Dellaquila : Sure. So we have said that that business represented on a full year basis about 1% to 2%, call it, 1.5% of sales. I'd say the average profitability relative to the total company. We had half of a normal year this year until the conflict began, and we've been scaling back the business significantly since, and now we intend to exit it. It will be a slow ramp as we exit it as we figure out exactly what those details are. But I mean -- with that context, I mean, you can determine what the full year contribution of the business is. And we've covered the piece that we expect to be without through the balance of the year within the guide. Brendan Luecke : Fantastic. And then one quick follow-up on KOB 3 within Automation Solutions. Just struck by the fact that it was again the biggest growth driver here. Can you speak a little bit to, I guess, the dynamics there and how you're driving that improvement? How much of that is price? And how often you find yourself in competitive situations for those revenues? Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah. Look, 60% of the revenue in the quarter in Automation Solutions was KOB 3, which is a replacement MRO business. That business is the least price-sensitive -- excuse me -- the least margin-sensitive of all the businesses and the one where we -- where price is the most sticky. So that was reflected in the results of Automation Solutions as we went through the end of March. Brendan Luecke : Thank you. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks. Frank Dellaquila : Thanks. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as our conference call for today. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Colleen Mettler. Please, go ahead. Colleen Mettler : Thank you, and good morning. Thank you for joining Emerson's third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call. Today, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; Chief Financial Officer, Frank Dellaquila; and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Please join me on Slide 2. This presentation may include forward-looking statements, which contain a degree of business risks and uncertainties. Please take time to read the safe harbor statement and note on the non-GAAP measures. I will now pass the call over to Emerson's President and CEO, Lal Karsanbhai, for opening remarks. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Colleen, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by thanking the nearly 90,000 Emerson employees around the world for their tremendous effort, passion and commitment to deliver the solid results we will speak about today. Over the past four months, I've had the opportunity to travel to several U. S. sites, including Houston, Chicago, Ohio and Pittsburgh as well as visiting investors, customers and our teams in Germany, Denmark, Brazil and Mexico. I have to be honest, there is no substitute for being with our teams in person. I'm looking forward to this month's trips to India and Singapore. And I'd also like to thank our Board of Directors for their support and our shareholders for your trust in us. As an organization, we continue to make significant progress on all of our strategic imperatives aimed to accelerate value creation, culture, portfolio and execution. Our culture evolution continues in earnest. We are launching our efforts with new listening tools, a modernized employee value proposition and a new reinvigorated talent engine. To this end, on August 1, we hired our first Vice President of Culture, [Kelly Clark], who joins our company at a crucial point in time and brings unparalleled experience and cultural transformation. Turning to Slide 3. Emerson's portfolio transformation is well underway. And in the quarter, we made significant progress to create a higher growth, more diversified cohesive portfolio. We took five important steps : Number 1, on May 16, we closed the AspenTech transaction. We are very excited about the synergy opportunities, which are sized at $160 million in the funnel and the projects won to date; Number 2, AspenTech announced an agreement to acquire Micromine, the first transaction under the new structure. Micromine is an Australian-based exploration to optimization software offering, well positioned to benefit from the minerals required to fuel the renewable revolution; Number 3, we announced and closed the acquisition of Fluxa, a critical life science process knowledge business, highly synergistic with our industry-leading DeltaV system; Number 4, on May 31, we closed the TOD sale; and last, 5, yesterday, we announced the sale of InSinkErator to Whirlpool Corporation for $3 billion or an 18.1 multiple of adjusted EBITDA.  Prior to turning to Slide 4, allow me to say a few words about our execution. This was a solid quarter, and I feel incredibly positive as we go into the fourth and into 2023. June trailing three-month underlying orders were plus 10%, driven by Automation Solutions at plus 13%. Third quarter underlying sales grew 7%, driven by the Americas, which grew 14%. This performance occurred despite lockdowns in Shanghai, which impacted six plants for two months and continued challenges with electronics availability. Together, the two factors resulted in a $180 million sales impact in the quarter or 5 points to the Automation Solutions segment sales. Adjusted EBITDA improved 20 basis points with improvement in both platforms. Operating leverage in the quarter was 27%, and we are well on track to exceed our 30% target for 2022. Adjusted EPS was $1.38, including $0.08 contribution from AspenTech. Although free cash flow conversion in the quarter was 100% adjusted for non-operating and onetime items. Operating cash flow was down driven by working capital investments in inventory and receivables. Let's now turn to Slide 4, please. In addition to the portfolio, Emerson has also made tangible steps in our ESG journey. Recently, we have established a target to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain by 2045. In the near term, our objective is to reach net zero in our operations and reduced our Scope 3 emissions 25% by 2030. Our 2021 ESG report, which can be found on emerson.com, includes more detail on our target, which is aligned with the net zero standard set by the science-based target initiative. Our goals are bold, and we have incredible credible road maps that include many of the solutions, technologies and expertise we offer our customers and the critical industries we serve. Please turn to Slide 5. I am particularly excited about the opportunities in the renewable space. As I said, our portfolio is broadly relevant as an enabling technology across a broad segment of the world's economy. This includes electrification efforts such as heat pumps as well as sustainability -- a strong sustainability funnel in Automation Solutions that has grown to $1.5 billion, inclusive of decarbonization, energy efficiency, emissions management and new energy investments in wind, hydro, solar and hydrogen. I'll share a few examples on this slide. First, starting on the left. Emerson was recently selected at Mitsubishi Power to automate the world's largest green hydrogen production and storage facility. The Advanced Clean Energy System hub will convert renewable energy into storable hydrogen, which can subsequently be dispatched and converted to electricity when required. Emerson Automation and Software Solutions were selected based on industry expertise in our leading digital portfolio. This is a first-in-kind facility, and we'll be capable of producing 100 tons of green hydrogen per day for storage capacity for 300 gigawatt hours of energy. That's equivalent to 150x the current lithium battery storage in the United States. Next, in the middle, along with Neste Engineering Solutions, we were chosen to provide automation technologies and software to Fintoil for the world's third largest tall oil biorefinery. The advanced biofuel and biochemical facility will refine a byproduct of the wood pulping process to produce sustainable feedstock for biofuels, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The expected annual capacity of 200,000 tons will create a 400,000-ton reduction in carbon emissions. That represents roughly 1% of Finland's total emissions. Lastly, Emerson was selected by Albioma, a French energy provider to enable the transition of its flagship coal-fired Bois Rouge plant to 100% renewable energy. Emerson's automation system and software will help convert the existing coal-fired power plant controls to utilize biomass feedstock. In doing so, this project will result in a 640,000 ton reduction in carbon emissions, part of Albioma's plan to reach almost 100% renewable energy by 2030. These projects and our net zero targets represent our continued progress in our greening up and green by framework that Mike Train has introduced. And lastly, before I turn it over to Frank, on Slide 6, I'd like to highlight a few exciting investments we've made in operations around the world. Our regionalization strategy and operational excellence served us well through the pandemic and in the current challenging supply chain environment. We continue to drive operational excellence with investments like the three shown here. Starting on the left. Earlier this month, Emerson officially opened our officially opened our new professional tools facility in Ash Flat, Arkansas. This is a 277, 000 square foot facility, which will be used mainly for our Greenlee tools for electrical applications across North America. It currently employs 150 employees, and we will double the employment over the next four years. I'm very excited about this investment, and we were honored to have Governor Asa Hutchinson, join us for the ribbon cutting. Next, in the middle, Emerson recently opened its Mahindra City Chennai, India facility for fluid control and pneumatics. This is a 145,000 square foot facility which will help serve process, hybrid and discrete customers in India and surrounding Asian countries. And then lastly, we introduced a new Saltillo, Mexico manufacturing facility for our specialty valve technologies, assemblies and actuators using life sciences, metals and mining and other key industries. As with all these facilities, Saltillo will use state-of-the-art factory automation capabilities, environmental designs and include our own Emerson technology. As we close out 2022, I feel extremely positive about where we are as a business and where we are going. Our goal is accelerated value creation and we are executing on all the critical dimensions. With that, I will now pass the call over to Frank Dellaquila, who'll go through our detailed financial results in the third quarter. Frank Dellaquila : Thank you, Lal, and good morning, everyone. If you would please turn to Slide 8. Before I comment on the third quarter, I'd like to take a minute to ground everyone on three significant events that affected the reported results. First, on May 16, Emerson completed its transaction with AspenTech. We contributed our two software businesses, OSI and GSS, to AspenTech in addition to $6 billion in cash in exchange for a 55% ownership position in the new AspenTech. Please note that GSS has been renamed to Subsurface Science & Engineering or SSE for short. OSI and SSE, which were previously reported in our Automation Solutions platform have now been moved to a newly created reporting segment within Emerson called AspenTech. For accounting purposes, our contributed businesses will the acquiring entity. Therefore, our third quarter is the sum of our contributed businesses for the entire quarter and heritage AspenTech results from the May 16 closing date. Stated simply, our third quarter results include a full quarter of our contributed businesses and approximately 45 days of heritage AspenTech. As a result, year-over-year comparisons are not meaningful as the prior year includes only our contributed businesses. I encourage you to review the slides Colleen and her team have included in the appendix, which show the details of the sales by quarter and map the AspenTech financial results into our financials. As a reminder, AspenTech's results are fully consolidated with Emerson line by line with the 45% non-controlling interest deducted from earnings used to calculate earnings per share and reflected in a single line in the equity section of the balance sheet. And finally, on that subject, our contributed businesses are no longer included in our usual metrics for Automation Solutions. The second significant item is the Therm-O-Disc divestiture, which was previously reported in Commercial & Residential Solutions. The transaction closed on May 31 and the business is no longer included in underlying orders, underlying sales or backlog calculations. We reported a $428 million after-tax gain equivalent to $0.72. And finally, we announced on the May call our decision to exit Russia. At that time, we absorbed several cents operationally within the guidance that we gave. This quarter, we are reporting a $162 million charge which is a $0.29 earnings per share impact, and we are debooking $132 million of orders that will not be converted to sales. The impact of the TOD gain and the Russia related charge will be removed from adjusted earnings. So with that background, if you would please turn to Slide 9, and we'll talk about the quarter. As Lal said, we believe we had a very good quarter. There are operations challenges we could not anticipate or building to the guide, but looking through them, we are very pleased with the underlying operational performance and we believe we can deliver results for 2022 that are in the range of what we told you in May with the exception of cash flow. Demand continued to be strong and broad-based and consistent with our previous comments around our key end markets. We missed the underlying sales guidance entirely due to the extended lockdown in Shanghai and some continued challenges around electronic components, neither of which we expected when we guided in May. Together, we estimate these two headwinds reduced sales by about $180 million in the quarter, which equates to 4 points of growth for total Emerson, and we estimate that the leverage on those sales was about 40%. Our guide for the balance of the year incorporates our expectation that our manufacturing capability in China and our component availability will support our sales plan for the remainder of the year, and Ram will talk about both of these subjects in more detail in a few minutes. As a result, underlying sales were 7% falling short of our third quarter guidance by 3 points at the midpoint. There's a lot of good news within these numbers. The business has implemented the planned pricing actions realizing 6 points of price overall and price less net material inflation significantly improved versus our prior quarters according to the plan. Adjusted segment EBITDA improved 170 basis points, driven mainly by the addition of AspenTech, which added 150 basis points. Operations improved 20 basis points, as Lal mentioned, despite the $180 million of missed sales and the deleverage on them as price realization and ongoing cost containment measures more than offset elevated inflationary pressures from wages and freight. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.38, up 16% versus prior year, and that includes $0.08 from the AspenTech segment, and I will provide details in a moment. Free cash flow was down 36% versus prior year mainly due to higher working capital from increased sales and continued supply chain constraints that cause more investment in inventory than we would have expected. In May, we reduced our cash flow guidance modestly with the expectation that the balance sheet release of working capital would occur during this fiscal year, but the continued operational challenges pushed this release in our estimation into 2023. Nonetheless, free cash flow conversion was 90% in the third quarter, excluding the non-operating items from net income, specifically, the TOD gain and adding back the impact to net earnings of the Russia exit write-offs. Turning to the business results. Automation Solutions underlying sales were up 4%, and as Lal said, up significantly more, another 5 points of growth if we were to adjust for the loss of the sales in China and due to the supply chain disruptions. Process hybrid and discrete sales were all up, led by energy, chemical and power and renewables segments. Sales in the Americas were up double digits, while Europe mainly due to Russia and Asia mainly due to the Shanghai lockdowns were down year-over-year. Price realized in the third quarter was 3%, driven by programs instituted earlier in the year and accelerated last quarter to address sustained electronics inflation and continued wage and freight increases. Backlog increased by $100 million in the quarter to $6.2 billion. This elevated level of backlog will support our sales plan for the fourth quarter and into 2023. As I said at the beginning, backlog has been revised to reflect $132 million e-booking in Russia and removal of the businesses contributed to AspenTech. Automation Solutions adjusted EBITDA improved 70 basis points versus the prior year due to price, leverage, favorable mix and cost controls despite the lower-than-anticipated sales volume. Turning to Commercial & Residential Solutions. The business continues to grow strongly, up double digits. Underlying sales increased 13%, including 12 points of price realization. Sales were up in all world areas, except China due to the COVID-19 lockdowns and softening demand. As we expected, Climate Technologies aftermarket and commercial strength offset moderating demand in the residential portion of the business. In Tools & Home Products, non-residential project activity remains strong. However, weakness in the retail segments continues. Backlog was flat in the quarter at $1.3 billion, after removing the impact of the divested Therm-O Disc business. Adjusted EBITDA for the platform was down 50 basis points, consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Within that, Climate Tech was approximately flat as 9 points of price realization and ongoing cost reductions drove a significant improvement in sequential leverage and profit margin for that segment.  The AspenTech segment contributed $239 million of sales at nearly 54% adjusted EBITDA. Once again, these sales represent a full quarter of results from Emerson's contributed businesses in addition to heritage AspenTech from the May 16 closing date through the end of the quarter. The heritage AspenTech sales for the period covered the second half of AspenTech's fourth fiscal quarter and reflect strong revenue growth based on normal seasonality in the business and the applicable revenue recognition rules for software sales. Together, we're off to a great start and we look forward to driving the synergies we identified and the diversification that we envisioned for our combined businesses. If you would, please turn to Page 10 for the EPS walk. As I said, adjusted EPS was $1.38, up 16%. There are several non-operating balance sheet items that net out to $0.02, notably stock compensation. We still have two plants that are on a mark-to-market and they were a significant favorable item in the quarter. Automation Solutions and Commercial residential operations leveraged at nearly 30% and contributed $0.09 to adjusted earnings per share versus prior year. AspenTech contributed $0.08 and driven by the strong fourth quarter in the heritage business, net of $0.01 of interest expense attributable to the transaction. We continue to deal with various operational challenges, returning to supply chain, logistics and labor. I'm going to hand off to Ram to comment on these issues as they affected the quarter and how we think we can navigate them for the balance of the year. Ram Krishnan : Thank you, Frank. Please turn to Slide 11. Consistent with previous quarters, the operating environment remained challenging in the third quarter, especially in terms of electronic component availability and the impact of the China COVID-19 lockdowns, which lasted much longer than we anticipated going into the quarter. Starting with the positives. Freight and labor costs and commodity prices are all trending in the right direction and provided some relief to the overall environment. Labor, which is primarily an issue for us in our Midwestern U.S. plants has improved from the winter months and the COVID-related challenges we have experienced. And commodity prices, mainly steel, copper and plastic resins have all continued to decline as we had anticipated. However, the two most impactful items in the quarter were the extended China lockdowns and the electronic component shortages. As we discussed in May, our expectation was China would begin reopening in the middle of May with full operation near the end of the month. As it played out, reopening was delayed until the end of May with full operation not until early June.  During this time, we did not expect our employees to work in closed loop operations, which would have required extended overnight stays in our factories. Therefore, we had little to no operation during the lockdowns. This delay in reopening represented roughly $100 million in lost sales in the quarter, primarily from our six manufacturing plants in the Shanghai area. We expect most of these sales to be made up in the fourth quarter. The China lockdowns and other supply constraints contributed to further electronic component availability issues. While lead times remain stable at elevated levels, capacity challenges at our critical suppliers led to more decommits in the quarter, and we were forced to go to the open market to procure components more than we had anticipated. This drove elevated purchase price variances and challenges in converting our backlog to sales, leading to an $80 million sales miss in the quarter, primarily in Automation Solutions. Six critical suppliers for us account for about 90% of the component shortages we experienced in the quarter. Our supply chain teams have stabilized the situation growing into the fourth quarter using a structured approach to expedite, participating in supply assurance programs and driving purposeful executive engagement with these critical supplies shoring up what is necessary for the end of the year. Finally, our global operations and supply chain teams continue to do an outstanding job, effectively managing the ever-changing landscape, allowing us to execute successfully for our customers. I will now turn the call back over to Frank to take us through the '22 outlook. Frank Dellaquila : Okay. Thank you, Ram. If you would, please turn to Slide 13. As we look towards the rest of the year and into 2023, demand continues to be strong with Emerson trailing three-month underlying orders up double digits versus prior year. June trailing three-month orders for Automation Solutions were up 13% versus prior year, indicative of broad continued strength across the business. Sustainability, decarbonization factory automation, modernizations and reshoring secular trends continue to drive investment decisions in key industries. We expect growth to continue in key process end markets like energy, chemicals and power and renewables and also expect favorable conditions in the life sciences and metals and mining markets, all of which will support growth into 2023. In Commercial & Residential Solutions, June trailing three-month orders were up 5%, led by Climate Technologies, which was up 9%. Commercial, industrial, food, retail and other non-residential end markets remain strong as project activity continues. Residential Climate business is showing some signs of moderation as we've expected and communicated, while our residential tools and home products business continues to soften as we first mentioned during the May call. This can be seen in the retail data, inflation weakens demand in the housing-related and home improvement markets. Aftermarket sales remained strong due to record high temperatures globally and the European heat pump market is propelled by energy efficiency imperatives as well as the unusually warm weather as well in Europe. You would please turn to Slide 14. We'll talk about the guidance update. So the revised guidance considers the continued robust underlying demand and balances it with the impact of the third quarter headwinds that we experienced. Emerson's underlying sales guidance has been moved to the low end of the range, updated to remove Therm-O Disc and to remove the businesses that we contributed to AspenTech as part of the transaction as well as the continued supply chain constraints that Ram mentioned. Automation Solutions 2022 underlying sales growth is now expected to be between 6% and 7%. We reduced the range modestly again to remove the businesses contribute to AspenTech and to recognize the third quarter impact of the ongoing challenges of supply chain constraints, principally in electronics. As Ram said, the China sales miss is expected to be recovered, but the challenges with electronics will extend beyond the end of the fiscal year. Recalibration of the sales outlook is based on our projected ability to convert orders along with the strong underlying demand backdrop, both of which should be supportive going into 2023. In Commercial & Residential Solutions, we have raised the bottom end of the guide to reflect our confidence in the outlook for the balance of the year. The guide reflects continued strong price realization across the platform. The fourth quarter is expected to be strong for both platforms, Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential Solutions supported by the solid demand and the record backlog. Inflationary pressures remain, but our pricing actions are expected to more than offset net material and other inflation. The guidance assumes no further impact on production of COVID-19-related lockdowns in China. And as Ram described, we believe we have secured adequate electronics supply to deliver the sales guide for the year. Regarding the AspenTech impact on the guide, heritage AspenTech's fiscal fourth quarter which was included in our fiscal third quarter is its seasonally strongest quarter due to the timing of contract renewals and the revenue recognition rules that apply. Therefore, we expect AspenTech's contribution to revenue and earnings to be a bit lower in our Q4. The business continues to drive the synergy plan, and there is active joint project engagement between the two companies. AspenTech solutions simultaneously help customers meet sustainability and operational excellence targets, which are top investment priorities for both their customers and Emerson's traditional customers. Our combined product portfolio is well positioned to be the digital partner for process and hybrid end users. We've updated the net sales guidance to account for the AspenTech transaction by 1 to 2 points and the incremental FX impact, which is now a 2 to 3 point headwind as well as the Therm-O-Disc divestiture. The InSinkErator transaction will close after the fiscal year, it has no impact on the 2022 guide. Share repurchase is expected to be $500 million. There's no change to the tax rate and dividend assumptions that we gave in the May guide. We have reduced the operating cash flow guide to $3 billion reflecting the balance sheet impact of the operational issues that we're seeing. CapEx has reduced to approximately $525 million. Free cash flow has been updated to $2.5 billion accordingly. After removing the impact of the three significant non-operating items, the former is divestiture gain the Russia exited in the third quarter and the significant further gain that we had in the first quarter, our free cash flow conversion for the year will be nearly 100%. We still expect total segment operating leverage to be in the 30% range, as we have said all year, and as we have said in previous calls. EPS is expected to be between $5.25 and $5.35 and adjusted EPS is now expected to be $5.05 to $5.15. Please turn to Slide 15 for the EPS walk. Starting on the upper left, the May guide for GAAP EPS was $4.77 to $4.92 due to the revised sales look for Automation Solutions and the TOD divestiture we\u2019re lowering the top end of the guide by $0.05. The $428 million after-tax gain on the TOD divestiture and the Russia charge are now incorporated into the guide. The revised EPS guide on a comparable basis to May is $5.20 to $5.30. AspenTech adds $0.13 operationally, partially offset by $0.08 of net intangibles amortization that results from the purchase accounting on the transaction. So the resulting revised GAAP guide for EPS is $5.25 to $5.35. The right side of the chart walks the May adjusted EPS guide to the current guide. The guide was $4.95 to $5.10. We have the same $0.05 operational-related reduction, AspenTech operations at $0.13, in this case, offset by $0.03 of interest expense on debt that is attributable to the transaction. So the new guide is $5.05 to $5.15. For your reference, I won't go through it, but on the next slide, there is a bridge from GAAP to adjusted EPS for the fiscal year. The customary adjustment items are there along with the three unique items that I've discussed. So before turning to the Q&A, again, I would encourage you to review the slides in the appendix that we've included that explain some of the accounting details of the AspenTech transaction. With that, thank you for your attention, and we will open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Lal, Ram, Frank, Colleen, good morning to all of you. Just I guess my first question is going to be about Aspen. One of the things that Aspen has is this incredible rolodex of clients. Can you just talk about if you have had any interaction with some of their customers on the hardware and system side? And if you could talk about any sort of early success in terms of engaging some of Aspen's customers on the Emerson side? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. Andrew, thank you. This is Lal. Sure. Look, we have a very active project funnel to begin with, and we worked very closely in conjunction with on world area selling organization and the AspenTech channel. It's sized at $160 million today, and it's balanced in three ways : by world area, by industry and by the technology. We've won to date slightly over $6 million of synergy projects, that\u2019s AspenTech into traditional Emerson customers, and Emerson into traditional AspenTech customers. So it's growing. And there's line of sight for another, I would suggest $10 million or so this fiscal year, depending on how things move over the next quarter. We have been awarded but not booked a very large projects as well that size that $40 million with a full automation suite and AspenTech in addition. So there's a lot of commercial activity. We have individuals at both AspenTech and Emerson that are responsible for delivering the synergy value and a lot of engagement. Just one last anecdote, Andrew, last week, I met with the CEO of Ascend Chemical, who is not just a very strong DeltaV customer but a very loyal AspenTech customer and again, spent time with Phil McDivid simply to lay out to the opportunities that we have as an organization as they digitize their plants and move to a top quartile performance. So a lot of great activity working at many different levels across the organization. and very excited about the synergies. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up question. I think before you sort of talked about potential visibility on capacity coming, I think, particularly in North America, but maybe some worldwide as well. I'm talking specifically about semiconductors because we know that sort of talking to chip brokers, industrial chips are still in very, very short [indiscernible], how has this visibility evolved over the past quarter? Has this moved out to the right? Are there delays in terms of this capacity coming on? Or do you still feel confident that this capacity started to come online late this calendar year, early next year? Ram Krishnan : Yes, Andrew, Ram here. In terms of capacity coming online, we've really worked with our top 6 suppliers, and we have a very good understanding of how this capacity will come online late '23 and into '24. TI as an example, two particular facilities, one in Lehi, Utah and the other in Richardson, Texas, where we buy a lot of our components from that capacity expansion is expected to come online somewhere in the next six to 12 months. At this point, on track. But frankly, the challenge is that most of our suppliers are seeing is equipment that they will need to bring this capacity online is getting delayed. But at this point, at least as it relates to capacity specific to Emerson, I think we feel pretty good that this capacity will come online late '23 and into '24, which was the plan. Operator : The next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. John Walsh : Just wanted to follow up on kind of how we should think about the incremental leverage here in the fourth quarter. I mean, I know you kind of talked about that 30% target. But I guess, the first half of the year, Auto Sol's running much higher. You obviously had the China disruptions in this quarter. Those reverse kind of any more granularity you can give us there on how you expect that business to leverage in the fourth fiscal quarter? Lal Karsanbhai : Look, I think, John, good question. Embedded in our guide is an assumption for -- if you just back into it about 32% operating leverage in Q4 for Emerson as a whole. That's of approximately 27% in Q3, up to 32%, I believe, in Q4, a little higher perhaps. So we feel really good about how the businesses are executing and the conversion. Obviously, we're working off a very attractive cost structure in automation, which should benefit us as we go through the quarter. Go ahead, Frank. Frank Dellaquila : John, yes, just to add just a little bit more to that. The Automation Solutions leverage in the first half, as you said, was very strong. We said it would normalize in the second half of the year, and it will, but it will be very strong for the full year off kind of a normalized level in the fourth quarter. And then in Commercial Residential Solution, the leverage is accelerating as the price actions kick in, which is what we said. Second half would be stronger sequentially, both from a margin and a leverage standpoint, and that's exactly what we're seeing. Lal Karsanbhai : And just to stand correct, the 32% leverage would be the full year calculation, 35% approximately in Q4. Sorry, John. John Walsh : Great. No, that's super helpful. And then obviously, congrats on announcing the transaction around InSinkErator Just curious if you can give us any more granularity on the timing if it might be able to get done by this calendar year just based on some things whirlpool set? And then just any more color on when that business will either go disc ops or if it will just get taken out of the business once it's sold? Frank Dellaquila : Yes. John, this is Frank. In terms of the timing, we and Whirlpool, both hope it will close as soon as we possibly can, but it's subject to the normal regulatory approvals. So I would expect it will be some time early in 2023, but we just don't know at this point.  In terms of the disc ops, we're looking at that, we may not at that point clear the bar for disc ops. Although it's a very significant business to us, may not be big enough to qualify for disc ops treatment. So at this point, I would expect not, but we're going to revisit that. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Well, so several of your peers saw a relatively big step back in growth in China towards the end of the quarter. Did you see anything like that? And could you update us on what you're seeing on the ground now in China? How much electronic related or lockdown-related headwind, if any, are you baking into Q4? And then just thinking with the regional focus, how are you thinking about the resiliency of your European business? Lal Karsanbhai : Sure. Good question. Yes, obviously, the quarter was challenging in China for us. The lockdown had a significant impact in both demand and execution. And that was reflected in the sales results that we shared with you. Having said that, we rebounded very aggressively in the month of June in terms of economic activity, and that has continued through early part of this quarter as well. So I am relatively optimistic about particularly the Automation segment, which had been on a very significant run in China that, that continues as we go through Q4. There is a very attractive funnel of projects in China, driven by availability of for lack of a better term, cheap Russian oil and gas coming into the country and investments into sustainability and renewables that are also being driven, including, I think, [John], the largest electrolyzer project in the world is actually in China. In terms of Europe, look, our Western European performance was actually quite positive through the quarter. We obviously had -- it was offset by Russia and parts of former Soviet Union that were impacted, obviously, during the war. But the Western European climate continues to be relatively resilient with growth in the quarter and expect the growth as we go into Q4. Andy Kaplowitz : And Lal, can you give us more color into how you're thinking about Commercial & Residential Solutions going forward? I know order growth actually improved a bit in June, which I assume is easier comps, but comps do continue to get easier. So could you continue to see steady or even improving order growth in the business? And then I know you've been relatively cautious on residential HVAC. And I think Frank mentioned some continued growing in that market for given the pun, but has that market continue to be a little better than your expectations? Lal Karsanbhai : There is no doubt that the market has been better than expectations, John. I think if you went back to when we first talked at the beginning of the year, we expected that orders to moderate significantly. In climate, that hasn't occurred to the pace that we expected. So that's a pleasant surprise. There's a lot of resiliency with upcoming changes in regulations that are driving now investments in this space as well. So I feel better than I did at the beginning of the year, and there's a proven resiliency there across all segments of the business, of course, watching the residential demand very, very carefully. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Can you just give us an update on where you stand on price/cost? And then how that plays through for the year, just in your updated guide? Frank Dellaquila : Yes. Steve, this is Frank. So on the last call, we talked about broadening the definition of price/cost to include material and wage -- I'm sorry, in addition to net material inflation to include wage and freight. And we said that we would basically implement enough price in the third quarter to cover everything that we're seeing, and we did. We covered it and then some in the third. So we turned that returned favorable and we expect to be more favorable in the fourth quarter as we work through this. The pricing actions are being delivered as planned, and we're seeing some moderation in the NMI, the net material inflation, as well as kind of a leveling off in the wage and freight inflation as well at somewhat elevated levels, but it's not continuing to accelerate. So the overall price, less material, wage, freight inflation in the equation is improving as we go through the year. Steve Tusa : Great. And then just 1 kind of nitpicky one on corporate was a lot lower than we were expecting. What's the guidance on corporate for the year? I guess there's some stock comp influence in there that you have. Is there any carryover into next year? Or is there something going on there with regards to the Aspen reporting. I don't think it's Aspen, maybe it's the stock comp stuff. Frank Dellaquila : No, it's not. I mean it's -- there were some one-timers in there last year, but I mean it's essentially the significant move to the stock comp in the quarter. We still have 2 of the 3 outstanding LTI programs that are mark-to-market. So that when the stock price went down temporarily, there was a significant mark-to-market on that. So no, there's nothing unusual going on in corporate other than the volatility that gets introduced by that mark-to-market. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : So maybe just to start us off, while on kind of the totality of the funnel, obviously, a lot of things have changed from especially the process world over the past, call it, six months. Obviously takes a while to book some of that stuff out. Any kind of dimensioning that you would use on funnel size and where you're seeing the lowest activity build maybe over the last three to six months? Europe sort of comes to mind first and foremost. I know you talked about that, but maybe more broadly as well. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. No, I'll be happy to. So the total project funnel is sized at $6.8 billion. That consists of about 440 projects between now and at the end of 2024. So that's kind of the visibility that we have today. As you're absolutely right, there was a lot of movement within the funnel as we went through the quarter, including projects that were booked, projects that were added. And then, almost $0.5 billion of projects value that we removed from the funnel, about 13 projects. The majority of which were impacted in Russia with a Baltic Chemical Complex and a Baltic LNG project that were in the funnel. So those are the big removals. But in terms of the project basically funnel size, essentially flat, but what did get relatively larger within it was the renewables value of the funnel, which grew from 1 to approximately 1.5 today. So it's very encouraging to see and our activity continues to increase significantly in that segment. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then just following up on CapEx, pretty decent sized kind of especially on a percentage basis, I understand free cash flow is sort of impacted for yourself and for all your peers early around the working capital situation. Just trying to gauge how much of the CapEx cut is just sort of protecting the cash plan versus more of a slowdown. A lot of the talk around growth has been pretty constructive. So just trying to marry those two phenomenon? Frank Dellaquila : Yes, Josh, no slowdown of any kind of key investments that we're making for both growth and to improve our cost position. There's always room in sustaining CapEx. And given the challenges on the operating cash flow line, we've squeezed down the sustained CapEx. But I can assure you, everything that needs to get done is getting done. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melis Research. Scott Davis : We talked a little bit about this Mitsubishi contract that you won on Slide 5. I'm just trying to get a sense of the scope of these types of things in materiality. And I guess it's -- when you say win an automation contract, you mean winning the control side, does it include things like flowmeters and stuff like that? Or perhaps you can kind of address that. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. Scott, good morning. Lal here. Absolutely. It's not too similar to an automation scope that we would discuss relative to a traditional carbon-based projects. So that would include control, it includes now the opportunity for AspenTech on the analytics and optimization. But of course, at the core, we have our funnel control elements, which are very relevant here and our sensor elements. So flowmeters, pressure transmitters, level. So it's the full automation scope that we bring to bear. A project like this can be as sizable as high as over $50 million, potentially as we execute it but it has that type of an opportunity. Scott Davis : Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the conversation of FX, I mean, big changes here in the last few months. And you guys are obviously global. But are we just still mostly talking just translation impacts here and no real competitive dynamics as far as some competitors using currency is a bit of an advantage, et cetera? Frank Dellaquila : Yes, Scott. Yes, correct. We are really talking about the impact on sales growth and translated profit. We typically don't have a lot of competitive issues around currency, our businesses position themselves defensively around currency and then they very conservatively hedge cash flows where it makes sense to do that. So no, we're not hearing anything from the businesses about being at a competitive disadvantage relative to somebody else's cost base being in a weaker currency. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Well, you've been pretty busy as illuminated in those 5 items you started with to start the call. I wonder if you could just give us a little bit more of a thought process here now and where we're at in the transformation? And maybe specifically, just thinking about what you've called disconnected assets, not expecting to name segments or businesses by name. But how far along are we in that process of taking action on disconnected assets? And how much longer should this process take? Lal Karsanbhai : Jeff, good to hear from you. No, I think it's a good question. We are on a journey and across all three of the strategic imperatives that I described. And along all three of them, I think we've made significant progress, and I appreciate you recognizing that. In terms of the portfolio, my commitment to our shareholders has been that by the latest on November 29 at our investor conference, we will portray the future state of the business and what we envision to be the end state of this journey. In the meantime, we will continue to look at opportunities and execute along a few dimensions, which I'm not really free to speak about at the moment. Jeffrey Sprague : And then just maybe on price, and I was just thinking automation, in particular, I think you said 3% price there with 12 in CRS, I back into 2, the question isn't really where it heads if it's 2 or 3. But the question is more just about the ability to get additional price in that business. I certainly understand CRS is where you need it most and some that you've gotten it pretty actively. But is there more positive price momentum coming through the system in Automation Solutions? Maybe a comment on price and orders relative to price and revenues. Could you give us some context there? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. I'll give you some -- I'll ask Ram to add some color as well. I feel really, really positive about the price realization in Automation Solutions. And as you know, Jeff, this is almost a decade now within that business segment that we've had positive price. The products and solutions continue to be highly differentiated from a customer perspective. The installed base at over $120 billion is very relevant and that replacement market has significant pricing elasticity in it and drives our ability to take price forward. Having said that, obviously, we have been in an incredible inflationary environment. We will continue to drive price where we can across the product families. But we also have to drive operational improvements so that our customers can realize value from improved activity. But I feel good about the environment we're in and ability to capture the value that's out there. Ram, color? Ram Krishnan : Yes. And I would add that in terms of price/cost, which includes the wage and freight inflation, that business has always remained green and the magnitude of price we get in that 2% to 3% range. Our list price increases obviously are a lot higher. We realize a percent of the list as we go into the market and execute. That will continue to remain positive in Q4 and certainly into 2023 and well ahead of the net material inflation as well as wage and freight. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just the first question around the free cash flow. So I think with your guidance here around sort of 80% conversion to adjusted net income this year. Maybe help us understand sort of how quickly they get back to 100% in fiscal '23. And as you work down the inventory often that can carry some margin headwind in the P&L. So just wondered kind of any thoughts around that dynamic and also what the contribution of Aspen is to the free cash flow in flow in the current year. Frank Dellaquila : Okay. Julian, this is Frank. The -- we would expect the balance sheet to normalize. I would hope in the first half of fiscal '23, I mean, we had a big sales quarter in the fourth quarter. we would expect growth when we start to talk about '23, I think we have pretty good robust growth expectations for '23. The inventory is actually in good shape. I have no concerns about what it is we have on the books. It's just simply a matter given all the operational challenges. I would expect to be in better shape on the conversion aspect of it by the middle of fiscal 2023. Margin headwinds do I take a point in terms of having some absorption issues, but I mean the businesses consider those, and I believe those are manageable. So even inside the guide that we have for the balance of this year, there's some of that, but it's more -- it's well considered within the guide in terms of that. It's just something we have to manage as we go through the adjustment on the balance sheet. AspenTech for this year, the 2022 cash flow, there was basically 0 contribution to cash flow in the third quarter, and it will be minimal as well in the fourth quarter, and that is a function of some -- some specific items having to do with the transaction, they had a final short period return as part of the transaction, and they accelerated a significant tax payment, which basically negated the free cash flow that they would have had in their fiscal fourth quarter and their fiscal first quarter is their -- appears to be their lowest quarter of the year on that score, and it also is the normal timing for their incentive comp payments, which basically absorbs much of the free cash flow. So inside of our number is minimal impact from AspenTech on free cash flow. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. And then maybe just following up on Aspen, specifically. So it looks like, to your point, because of some of these one-timers I think Aspen itself is not really earnings accretive in the fourth quarter when we leave aside OSI and SSE earnings. So just wondered if you could confirm that that's the case, how do you think about the... yes? Frank Dellaquila : No, I'm sorry, Julian, to interrupt. No, it is in fact earnings accretive, I mean it was $0.08 accretive in the third quarter. We've built $0.10 into the guide for the year, which obviously implies it's at least $0.02 accretive in the fourth quarter. So yes, it will be -- it will, in fact, be accretive. I'd point you to on Slide 15. We've got AspenTech operations contributing $0.13 for the year. So -- and then we deduct the interest expense attributable to the debt, and we get to $0.10 net contribution for the year, $0.08 of which we had in the\u2026 Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. And maybe, Frank, just on that point, when we're trying to think about the sort of think about the sort of non-controlling interest, that was a big number in Q3. How do we think about that for Q4, just as that sort of jumping off point for next year? Colleen Mettler : Julian, we'll follow up with you. Frank Dellaquila : Yes, let us follow up on that one with Julian, okay. Operator : Our next question next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : Can I just start with a couple of clarification items on the quarter and the guidance? First of the China impact of $100 million, is that completely incremental versus what you guys had expected for 3Q? Or had you expected any impact? And then in the $0.05 of reduction in core operations plus Therm-O Disc, for the full year, how much was Therm-O Disc versus core operations? Frank Dellaquila : So the -- yes, it was incremental. Those are sales we expected to have in the third quarter when we guided in May, that we lost entirely as a function of the extended lockdown, and that $0.05 is mainly the operational issues around the -- around supply chain. Therm-O Disc is maybe $0.01 or $0.02 of that. Nicole DeBlase : Okay. Got it. That's clear. And then can we just talk a little bit about what you guys are seeing with respect to oil and gas customers, KOB 3 versus what was the project activity given all the movement we've seen in the oil price recently? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. Sure, Nicole. So KOB 3, the quarter set at 62% of automation. So it's been relatively consistent in that 60% range. We expect it to be right in that 60% range as we go through the year. The project activity is very robust and continues to be. We have active engagements across EPCs, particularly Bechtel, who's taken a significant number of the new LNG jobs in Texas and Louisiana, and those are in design phase and engineering phase right now. But again, it is combined with a significant investment in the sustainability efforts as well along emissions, carbon capture and energy efficiency. And then the last one is the North America shale environment is improving, and that's driven by gas demand. It's just very positive. And that's both for U.S. capacity in chemicals and for Mexico as well. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session and conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Colleen Mettler. Please go ahead. Colleen Mettler : Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us to discuss our Q4 and full year 2022 earnings and an exciting milestone in our portfolio transformation. Today, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; and Chief Financial Officer, Frank Dellaquila for the presentation. Also here with us is our Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan. I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation which is available on the Investor page of our website. This presentation and responses to questions may include forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those disclosed today, is available on Emerson's most recent annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC and subsequent SEC filings. After our remarks, we will hold the Q&A and appreciate you limiting your questions to one. With that, I will now turn the call over to Emerson's President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Colleen. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Please turn to Slide 4. Allow me to begin by saying that I'm very proud of Emerson's global team for the results delivered in 2022. Thank you. We had a strong finish to the results in 2022, with underlying sales growth of 9%, operational leverage of 36%, an adjusted EPS of $5.25, representing a 16% increase over prior year. As we will discuss during today's call, most importantly, we have a strong outlook for 2023, supported by end market growth and excellent operational execution. Shortly after becoming CEO in February of 2021, we embarked on an ambitious journey to accelerate value creation for Emerson shareholders. This required a bold transformational agenda, inclusive of culture, portfolio and execution. Alongside our Board of Directors, we underwent a comprehensive assessment of Emerson's portfolio and identified potential new market segments for investment. We designed the path forward based on a vision to create a pure-play automation company. Today, we achieved a significant milestone in this portfolio transformation by announcing the sale of a majority interest of the Climate Technologies business to Blackstone. Emerson, going forward, will be a unique automation company with a cohesive higher-growth portfolio exposed to diverse end markets and aligned to the world's secular trends, including digital transformation, sustainability, energy security and near-shoring. We have ample room to invest both organically and through disciplined capital deployment in M&A to build automation capabilities along our technology stack which is industry-leading and is composed of intelligent devices, control and software, serving leading customers in process, hybrid and discrete industries. We will do this while maintaining our commitment to return cash to our shareholders through share repurchase and the dividend. In 2023, we enter our 67th consecutive year of increased dividends per share. I\u2019m excited and cannot think of a better time during my 27 years at Emerson to be optimistic about our future. To provide more details on our results, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Frank. Frank Dellaquila : Thank you, Lal and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. As Lal mentioned, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to a very good year. Underlying sales grew 12% with Automation Solutions at 13% and Commercial & Residential at 10%. Segment EBITDA margins improved by 260 basis points on 54% adjusted EBITDA leverage, excluding AspenTech. Within the total segment margin improvement, Automation Solutions improved 190 basis points year-over-year and commercial residential improved 250 basis points. Operational performance was exceptional with incremental margins exceeding 50% in both platforms. Price realization accelerated in the second half of the year, peaking in the fourth quarter as both businesses delivered on the price plans we communicated on previous calls. In particular, Commercial Residential realized more than 10 points of price in the second half, driving sequential improvement in leverage and margin. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.53 grew 16%, including a $0.04 contribution from AspenTech and despite a significant currency headwind, $0.05 in the quarter that will continue into 2023. Orders continue to be solid, up 6% in Automation Solutions and 7% in Commercial Residential on a 3-month roll. Automation Solutions backlog was reduced by $400 million in the quarter but remains robust at $5.8 billion and supports our sales outlook for 2023. AspenTech contributed $251 million of sales in the quarter at nearly 33% adjusted EBITDA in what is typically a seasonally low quarter for the business. Please turn to Slide 6 and we'll review the full year in more detail. We believe we delivered excellent financial performance in 2022 despite widely known operational and geopolitical challenges. Underlying sales were up 9%, meeting our full year guidance. Adjusted segment EBITDA improved 140 basis points for the year with incremental margins of 36%, well ahead of our 30% target. This performance was enabled by favorable product and geographic mix, focused cost management and the ongoing benefits of our cost reset program mainly in Automation Solutions. That program which we initiated in 2019, achieved its goal of 24% adjusted EBITDA for Emerson a year earlier than planned. Portfolio actions, primarily the addition of AspenTech added 50 basis points to the margin improvement. Adjusted EPS was $5.25, up 16% versus prior year, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.10. Free cash flow was down 20% versus the prior year, mainly due to higher working capital from strong sales growth and supply chain constraints that we experienced throughout the year. Nonetheless, free cash flow conversion was nearly 100% for 2022 after adjusting for the impact of nonoperating items, divertive and TOD gains and the exit from Russia. Turning to the business results. Automation Solutions underlying sales were up 7% for the year. Demand for the year played out much as we anticipated and the business delivered excellent profit performance despite ongoing electronic component challenges. Traditional process markets gained momentum as the year progressed, while hybrid and discrete markets remain strong throughout. Each of these markets grew in the mid- to high single-digit range. Underlying sales were led by 14% growth in the Americas and 11% growth in China. Automation Solutions adjusted EBITDA improved 190 basis points versus the prior year, with 70% incremental margins. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales grew 13%, including 10 points of price realization. The business delivered the price actions we committed for the second half and drove favorable price cost. Sales were supported by Climate Technologies broad-based demand in North America and Europe. Tools & Home Products growth moderated as the year progressed but profitability was cushioned by continued price realization. Adjusted EBITDA margins for Commercial Residential ended the year at 20.9%, down 70 basis points, as expected but with significant improvement in the second half, largely due to achievement of the planned pricing actions. AspenTech contributed $656 million of sales at 38% adjusted EBITDA. Commercial initiatives and business integration are proceeding as planned. And as a reminder, 2022 financial results include a full year of Emerson's 2 contributed businesses and heritage AspenTech results from the closing date of May 16, 2022. Please turn to Page 7 for the EPS walk. As I said, 2022 adjusted EPS was $5.25, up 16%, driven primarily by operations which contributed $0.68. Nonoperating items and share repurchase each contributed $0.03. We are very pleased with our 2022 financial results which were achieved in a challenging environment. Now, I will turn it back to Lal to provide his perspective on the significant portfolio announcement we made this month. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Frank. Please join me on Slide 9. Our portfolio journey has been guided by a clear road map to transform Emerson into a pure-play automation company. And today marks a significant and definitive step on that journey. Our announcement to divest the majority interest in Climate Technologies to Blackstone is a milestone transaction for Emerson with compelling financial benefits. Emerson will monetize the majority of our Climate Technologies business and an attractive valuation of 12.7x 2022 EBITDA, providing approximately $9.5 billion of upfront pretax cash proceeds to invest in growth. The transaction structure also enables additional cash proceeds from the future exit of our noncontrolling ownership. With the exit of Climate Technologies, we are creating a company with a cohesive portfolio, higher growth and profitability. Our leading technology and software will be positioned to capture secular growth trends in digital transformation, sustainability, decarbonization and near-shoring. The proceeds from the divestiture will focus on strategic automation acquisitions that will strengthen our business and diversify our end market exposure and to return capital to shareholders. We are excited about the long-term value creation opportunity this transaction unlocks which we will have -- we will spend time discussing in a moment. Before that, I'll have Frank go over the details of the transaction and timing. Frank Dellaquila : Thanks, Lal. Please turn to Slide 10. Before I walk through the highlights of the transaction structure, I'd like to provide some background on the decision process that brought us to this point. When management and our Board made the decision to transform Emerson into a pure-play automation company, we began a rigorous analytical process with our external advisers to determine how to divest Climate Technologies in the most efficient and value-creating way for our shareholders. We explored the full range of alternative transaction structures to accomplish a separation, weighing all the relevant factors, including valuation, complexity of execution, timing and where we are in the market cycle for both the business and for public equities. We are confident the sale to Blackstone under the terms I will describe in a moment, provides the best execution for our shareholders, achieving an attractive multiple with certainty in an unsettled financial market environment. The upfront proceeds enable opportunistic capital deployment in the near term while retaining meaningful upside in the potential of the business under Blackstone's control, together with our sale of InSinkErator, at a multiple of 18x EBITDA which is expected to close today, we can assure you that we are intently focused on maximizing the value of these world-class businesses most efficiently in the current market environment. With that as background, I will go through the headline elements of the transaction. Emerson will sell a majority stake in its Climate Tech business to Blackstone valuing the business at $14 billion, representing a 12.7x multiple on 2022 EBITDA. In addition to the pretax cash proceeds of approximately $9.5 billion, Emerson will also receive a note of $2.25 billion at closing and will retain a 45% common equity noncontrolling interest in a new joint venture that will own Climate Technologies. The upfront cash consideration will be funded by $5.5 billion of fully committed debt financing and $4.4 billion equity contribution from Blackstone, including both common equity and convertible preferred. The entity will continue as a joint venture between Emerson and Blackstone until its sale or IPO, at which time Emerson would receive additional cash proceeds from its note and ultimately, from its 45% common equity ownership. Climate Technologies will be managed by Blackstone and Emerson will not be responsible for the operation of the business post-closing. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2023 upon satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Our management team is working to identify the actions required to rightsize our corporate and platform functions. These actions will be sufficiently implemented by the time we close this transaction, eliminating any stranded costs that would have resulted from the sale. In addition, management is working on actions to streamline the corporate and platform structure consistent with our new scale, targeting approximately $100 million of run rate savings by the end of 2024. Additionally, Emerson is selling ownership of the St. Louis, Missouri headquarters campus to the joint venture. Terms include a 3-year lease back with an option to extend an additional 2 years. During that time, Emerson will undertake a comprehensive assessment of potential headquarters locations, including in the St. Louis area based on the company's long-term interests. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Lal for additional insights. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Frank. Please turn to Slide 11. Climate Technologies is a leading $5 billion global manufacturer of HVACR compression products related solutions and controls. The business has leading positions in its segments and upside potential but is not aligned with our strategic vision for Emerson as a cohesive automation portfolio serving higher growth markets. Blackstone has a strong track record of growing businesses and we are confident Climate Technologies will continue to thrive under their ownership. Please turn to Slide 12. Today's announcement is certainly our largest step, as I mentioned previously but there were many others along the way. The work required creativity. And I am proud of what we have achieved in a very short time. We've invested approximately $9 billion in intelligent automation technology and software. This includes our recent acquisitions of Fluxa and Mita-Teknik and our 55% ownership of AspenTech and its announced acquisition of Micromine. These companies accelerate Emerson's growth profile, profitability and end market diversification into areas like renewable power, life sciences and metals and mining. We've also realized approximately $18 billion in gross proceeds from divesting noncore and slower growth assets at attractive valuations, like Climate Technologies, InSinkErator and Therm-O-Disc. Turning to Slide 13. This transformation positions Emerson as a $14 billion automation leader with an attractive growth profile, diverse end markets and leading technology. Emerson has the most complete portfolio of intelligent devices, control systems and software in the industry. This includes 13% of our sales from software inclusive of AspenTech, representing a leading percentage among industrial peers. These differentiated solutions and our expertise help customers solve their most complex challenges, including optimizing operations, protecting personnel, reducing emissions and achieving sustainability goals. Emerson is able to do this across a broad and diverse set of end markets within process hybrid and discrete and on a global scale. Turning to Slide 14. These end markets are experiencing key secular growth trends, as I mentioned earlier and these are aligned with many of the world's most pressing challenges. First, through digital transformation programs, customers are spending more on sensing and data, software, digital twins and other intelligent solutions to gain more visibility into their operations. As we discussed during our AspenTech transaction announcement, we continue to see our customer share of wallet shift towards software and digital solutions. Next, as the world pushes to net zero, sustainability and decarbonization investments are growing at a rapid pace. This includes the decarbonization of existing infrastructure through optimization, energy efficiency and emission reductions projects. It also includes the introduction of new energy sources like clean fuels and hydrogen. Lastly, near-shoring trends around the world have widespread effects on many industries. Underpinning each of these secular growth drivers is the need for increased automation, creating an incremental prolonged investment period for the solutions that Emerson provides. We look forward to discussing these organic growth programs at our investor conference in November. I'll now turn the call back over to Frank for more details on Emerson moving forward. Frank Dellaquila : Thank you, Lal. Please turn to Slide 15. This slide highlights Emerson's enhanced financial profile on several key metrics as we become a focused automation business. The transformation Lal discussed will position Emerson to increase its through-the-cycle growth rate to mid- to high single digits from historical low single-digit levels. Benefits from the pervasive secular growth trends that Lal mentioned and an emphasis on innovation will be important factors in this transformation. Our more concentrated exposure to these growth trends, our management process and wide-sized fixed cost structure will drive higher levels of profitability, reflected an expected incremental margins in the 35% range. Structurally, Emerson's new portfolio will have higher margins based on increasing software content and high-margin recurring aftermarket and subscription revenues. Emerson will be less capital intensive at approximately 2% of sales and cash conversion will continue to be strong at approximately 100% of net income. Please turn to Slide 16. We want to reiterate our commitment to a disciplined capital allocation strategy that balances growth with return of capital to our shareholders. The proceeds received from the Climate Tech and InSinkErator divestitures will enhance our ability to drive internal growth programs and expand our portfolio while continuing to provide robust cash returns to our shareholders. Driving organic growth will be a priority as we invest to accelerate innovation through new processes and higher R&D spend focusing on breakthrough technologies. Our balance sheet capacity will enable us to pursue strategic acquisitions in defined automation verticals to accelerate growth and enhance end market diversity. And we remain committed to providing meaningful cash returns to our shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. We announced this morning that in 2023, we will increase our dividend for the 67th consecutive year. And we intend to repurchase $2 billion of our stock during the fiscal year. Please turn to Slide 17. We believe this transaction is a critical step in the process of unlocking value for our shareholders. This slide walks through the multiple levers that we believe support value creation potential. First and importantly, is the value of the new Emerson, a company that benchmarks favorably against our automation peers in terms of growth outlook, profit margins, free cash flow conversion and software content. The second lever is our controlling ownership position in AspenTech, a premier industrial software leader whose market cap has increased 40% since we closed the transaction on May 16. As a part of Emerson, AspenTech enables significant strategic benefit to our business through the synergies we have discussed in the past and also provides a high multiple vehicle for further investment in industrial software. Third is the approximately $10 billion in cash net proceeds from the divestitures of Climate Tech and InSinkErator which enables capital deployment at scale for organic growth and M&A and return of capital to shareholders via share repurchase. Finally, this transaction structure allows us to retain a noncontrolling investment in Climate Tech through both our $2.25 billion note and $2 billion in common equity which will be monetized over time, providing additional resources for strategic investments. We believe all of these factors result in a compelling story supporting shareholder value creation. I hope you can see why we and our Board are excited about this transaction and the value potential we believe it will unlock for Emerson shareholders over time. Now please turn to Slide 19 and we'll discuss the outlook for 2023. We intend to report Climate Technologies, InSinkErator and Therm-O-Disc financial results as discontinued operations starting in the first quarter of 2023. This slide includes the 2022 reported results I discussed a few minutes ago on the left side. On the right side are the components of the reported results that will comprise our continuing operations in 2023. To continuing operations data for 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 are also included in the appendix for your reference. Continuing operations consist of Automation Solutions, AspenTech and our safety and productivity business which is a rebrand of the core capabilities of our professional tools business after the InSinkErator divestiture. We will provide guidance for 2023 continuing operations and that is how we will communicate about our business in the future. Also, we are in the process of determining the reporting segments for our new automation focused business and we plan to provide additional information on segments at our Investor Day on November 29. If you would, please turn to Slide 20. We continue to see strong market dynamics in 2023. Process, hybrid and discrete markets are all expected to grow mid- to high single digits. Specifically, LNG, hydrogen and clean fuels will all benefit from energy security, resiliency and sustainability trends. Life Sciences continues to be a growth opportunity for Emerson as ongoing investment support drug vaccine and medicine development. We expect 2023 to be another strong year for our discrete business coming off accelerated growth in the previous 2 years. We continue to be optimistic about the long-term prospects for discrete, especially within semiconductor, electronics and EV manufacturing markets. From a world area perspective, we expect Americas growth to continue to be strong, led by energy investments. European growth will likely lag as demand resulting from the energy crisis is expected to be offset from downside effects on our discrete and chemical businesses. We continue to keep a close watch on developments in China but at this point, we still expect mid-single-digit sales growth in 2023. Please turn to Slide 21. Expected strength in our key end markets, together with our robust backlog support our guidance for underlying sales growth between 6.5% and 8.5%. Acquisitions, mainly AspenTech are expected to add another 4 points to reported growth, approximately offset by a currency headwind from the strong U.S. dollar, equating to negative 3.5 points of sales growth and approximately $0.09 of EPS headwind at current exchange rates. We remain committed to driving our business to mid-30s incremental margins through our operational execution with additional leverage from AspenTech. We expect adjusted EPS to increase from $3.64 in 2022 to between $4 and $4.15 in 2023, a 12% increase at the midpoint. Please note that the adjusted EPS guide does not include any interest income from undeployed divestiture proceeds which could exceed $100 million at current interest rates if we close halfway through the fiscal year. Free cash flow conversion is expected to continue to approximate 100%. For the first quarter, we expect net and underlying sales to increase between 6% and 8%. Currency will be a substantial headwind in the first quarter, reducing sales growth by approximately 6 points and earnings per share by about $0.03 at current exchange rates. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be between $0.85 and $0.89, a 10% increase at the midpoint. Before we head to Q&A, I\u2019ll pass it back to Lal for some closing comments. Thank you. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Frank. We hope you share our excitement about the future of Emerson and the tremendous value creation opportunities ahead. The Climate Technologies transaction marks the biggest step in our portfolio transformation to a cohesive high-growth company. The $9.5 billion upfront cash proceeds from the transaction provides financial optionality as we look to strategically build out our leading automation portfolio. We are a great company and we will never rest on trying to be better. I'm excited about the future of Emerson. We look forward to speaking with all of you again at our investor conference in November, where we will share more about our ongoing value creation strategy. Thank you for joining us today. Colleen Mettler : Thank you, Lal. We will now turn it to Q&A. As mentioned at the top of the call, we will ask that you limit your questions to just one. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Congrats on the deal. Lal, so I know it\u2019s early but maybe you can give us a little more color into you\u2019ll use the $10 billion of cash you\u2019ll have post the transaction. You talked about spending $2 billion on share repurchases but can you talk a little bit more about the priorities for spending the cash? Is Aspen is spending number one on that list? And any more color you could give us on the new growth pillars that you\u2019ll talk about in a month. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. I know, Andy. Certainly, obviously, the $2 billion share repurchase is very important. But equally important is our discipline that we put in place around M&A. The work that I described alongside our Board to identify 4 priority industry segments is very important. We'll go into a lot of detail when we meet in November at investor conference on each of those 4 segments. But I will say that work continues -- is underway -- as we speak in potential activity in these segments. So we'll -- what I can tell you about each and every one of those is they're consistent with the automation stack. They are consistent with our perspective that we need a higher growth and end market diversification within our business. And I think we'll have a good discussion about that when we meet. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Andrew Obin : I know you guys are going to have an analyst meeting but I\u2019m still going to probe on use of proceeds. You sort of stated that \u2013 well, not stated but my understanding was that you would have a plan for deploying the capital if you were to monetize the assets and you have been very active monetizing the assets. So I just want to understand the visibility on the funnel that you have because you have plenty of capital. If I think what\u2019s available, there is a private company that doesn\u2019t want to sell. There was a target that didn\u2019t want to sell that was public. So I\u2019m just wondering sort of \u2013 it seems like you\u2019re looking for a sizable target in automation space. And just what does the funnel look like? Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Andrew. Obviously, I know you want me to start listing names of the companies. I can't do that. Andrew Obin : I would love it. Lal Karsanbhai : As I've said, Andy. So a couple of things. Number one, clearly, we're looking for sizable opportunities in large markets. There has to be relative strength in market position for it to be relevant and impactful to the Emerson shareholder. We're looking for exposure in higher growth. We're looking for profitability and differentiated technology. And we certainly are going to be very diligent on the alignment to the technology stack and automation solutions. So those are the guiding principles. And I will tell you, the funnel is robust. It's very active. And our team in M&A led by Ram and Vincent Servello is doing a great job with it. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Congratulations. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Steve. Steve Tusa : Yes. Busy start for you, Lal congrats on that. First of all, can you just walk us to the $14 billion valuation? It\u2019s like not quite clear to me how you guys are getting to that just based on the numbers you\u2019ve given, like what kind of leverage the JV will have? And did the structure was just a tad bit, not 100% crystal clear. Frank Dellaquila : Sure. Steve, this is Frank. So there is a -- if you get to the $14 billion, basically, you've got about $4 billion, $4.3 billion being contributed by Blackstone in the form of common equity and the convertible preferred. That $5.5 billion of third-party senior debt, basically bank debt and debt from other parties. So if you add that up, you get to the -- including our PIK note, $2.25 billion PIK note and our retained contribution, our retained equity, you get to $14 billion and we can walk you through the exact numbers but that's how you get there. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then just the tax implications on an after-tax basis? And then just one quick follow-up. Frank Dellaquila : Sure. So the upfront proceeds on an after-tax basis, we expect will be around $7.8 billion; [indiscernible] pretax, about $7.8 after tax on the upfront proceeds. Steve Tusa : And then one last one on the guide. The underlying orders are up about 6%, I guess, for the core kind of A&S business. You're trending at about that number exiting the year but you're guiding to something higher than that? I mean, what's giving you the confidence that, that actually accelerates? Is that just backlog conversion going forward? And how do you expect these orders to trend as that lead time kind of normalizes? Ram Krishnan : Yes, Steve, Ram here. Yes, you\u2019re spot on, I think, underlying orders are around 6% and then we\u2019ve got $5.8 billion plus of backlog in the automation business that will convert into next year. So we\u2019re pretty comfortable with the sales guide. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : Congrats on the deal. Just maybe a follow-up on the \u201823 outlook and with Steve\u2019s question, how should we think about that volumetrically? Because I would imagine of that 6 point of order growth that you had that you got a lot of price in that. You said you got about 6 points of price, I think, in the core business this quarter. Just wondering how we should think about kind of the different pieces of the volume equation for \u201823? And then how much of that backlog draw you\u2019re baking into the guidance? Ram Krishnan : Yes. So from a price perspective, 2, 3 points of price, the rest will be volume. And I think we've got the $5.8 billion of backlog is high for the automation business. So we'll have backlog conversion baked into the plant. So I would say 3% to 4% volume growth, rest price plus the backlog drawdown. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then this might be hard to pin down but because Russia, Ukraine is so recent and it takes a while for your customers to move their feet on this, does that have any appreciable uptick from these new energy investments or LNG that would be specifically done as a result of Ukraine? Or is that still premature? Lal Karsanbhai : No, I think it's very active, Josh. The activity, particularly in Louisiana, Texas and Mexico is incredibly robust. The number of projects that have been engineered and are going through funding and we're very engaged in through engineering contractor such as Bechtel [ph] are significant. And they're vastly in response to the energy security of Europe. And so we're pretty excited about what we're seeing right now. Operator : The next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : You guys are really busy. So congratulations on the deal. I just want a quick clarification. First of all, the [indiscernible] adjustments to continue operations. I\u2019m guessing about $0.10 or so I was trying to call it if you just maybe just confirm that. And then just dictate on the crack of the proceeds. When you think about automation, I mean, how you define that? Is that more software-centric automation companies? Or are you looking at more installed base type of opportunities? And within the mix, it\u2019s buying in the minority of AspenTech a possibility in the minimum options, is that even the possibility? Lal Karsanbhai : So I'll take Parts B and C and I'll turn it to Frank for the first part of your question, Nigel. So on AspenTech, we are in a 2-year standstill which we announced at the time of that transaction. So from that perspective, we are going to continue to operate under the current ownership structure that we have which we feel very comfortable with how that's working. Secondly, in terms of future automation investments and M&A, it's consistent across the stack. We'll continue to look at intelligent devices. We'll probe around the control system area. And then obviously, you're absolutely right. There are opportunities around software as that market continues to move aggressively. Those investments will occur predominantly within the AspenTech structure. But we look across the entire stack with an eye towards growth and diversification. Frank? Frank Dellaquila : Nigel, this is Frank. On Part A, I'm going to need you to help me out again with that question. I'm not sure I got it. Nigel Coe : Yes. Okay. So let me take to correct this. So you just did \u2013 continuing EPS is about 3.64, I think it is which is about adjustments. So I\u2019m getting about 1/3 contribution from some PP, about contribution from InSinkErator and then [indiscernible] that\u2019s trying to cost. Frank Dellaquila : In the ballpark, I mean, we'll have to come back to you on that. I don't have the pieces exactly on that right now but it's close, roughly in the mid-130s as you walk across from -- as we are to continuing ops for Emerald and $0.25 give or take between InSinkErator and Therm-O-Disc. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Jeff Sprague : Congrats. Lal, just wondering on tools. I guess I heard it kind of framed as part of productivity solutions which I guess maybe that could be an adjacency to automation of sorts? Or how should we think about that particular piece of the portfolio? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, we did rebrand the tools business as safety productivity. So you have that right. It is, as you know, what we're talking about here is a technology-driven industrial and commercial application business at this point. So that's the way to think about it. There's a significant safety element around it and leverage within Automation Solutions, be it voltage detection, gas detection which we do across that entire platform. Having said that, as you think broadly about the portfolio, we have accomplished a lot in a short amount of time. Our belief and our board's belief was that Climate was the most significant move to unlock the potential. But look, portfolio management will continue to be active for -- across this company. And -- but we're very excited about the progress that we've made to date. Jeff Sprague : And then maybe just a follow-up, if I could, just again on the deal structure and the economics. At this EV and you guys pulling so much out upfront, I\u2019m just trying to think about with the note being a PIK note and you got 45% of a highly leveraged entity, just how you expect that back end to actually ultimately play out? Frank Dellaquila : Jeff, this is Frank. Actually, we're very optimistic about the back end. The $2.25 billion PIK note is senior in the cap structure. So we feel very confident that we're going to get paid out on that on the accreted value at the appropriate time. So we have no concerns about that. And we think the prospects for the business are very good. So at the time that the monetization event occurs, we think that our common equity interest as well is going to be very good for us. So -- and there's a cap on the leverage as well. So we feel good about where we are on the PIK debt and the cap structure and about the overall leverage and cap structure for the business is 4x leverage is what we have going in and that is as high as it's going to go. Operator : The next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse. John Walsh : Congratulations. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, John. John Walsh : It\u2019s come out in a couple of different ways, looking at the guidance for next year but maybe can you talk a little bit about the inflation side of the equation and maybe tie it all together on kind of price cost expectation for us as we go through next year, first half, second half? Or you going to talk about it? Ram Krishnan : Well, I think for us, as we were green in the fourth quarter and we expect to be green on a price cost basis as we go into next year. Certainly, the automation business was green throughout last year and '22. And so the expectation will be to expect to continue. And we're not going to give you exact numbers right yet, possibly as we go into the year, we will. But I think you can bake in positive price cost for the automation business or Emerson continuing ops going into next year. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Snyder from UBS. Chris Snyder : I wanted to follow up with a quick one on capital deployment. So the company has spoken a lot about further M&A on the automation side to build out the portfolio. Will the company look at deals over the near term? Or should we assume that further M&A will come after deal close and the liquidity injection? Lal Karsanbhai : No. Look, these deals take time. Things take time to consummate. We're always working and building relationships and thinking about markets and studying markets. So it's an ongoing process for us. And whether it comes well aligned with close prior or shortly after there may be some activity but I can't predict timing to be honest with you. Operator : The next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : My first question, Slide 13, just a clarification question. So software and control systems, intelligent devices, this is how you guys are going to be segmenting going forward. And then I guess within that, the old like tools and Home Products business is like roughly, what, like $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion in revenues, excluding InSinkErator? Frank Dellaquila : Yes, correct. That's correct, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Okay, great. That's helpful. And then secondly, just AspenTech, I'd be curious, I think the implied, I guess, the EBITDA from this quarter was roughly, call it, $80 million, $85 million. It's a little bit lighter than our expectations. I'm just -- I'm curious, like what's embedded in your guidance for 2023 for AspenTech EBITDA? Ram Krishnan : First off, I think the -- as Frank mentioned, this quarter is seasonally low for AspenTech. So I think the 33% EBITDA on the $251 million is consistent with our overall plan. Frank, I'll let you comment on what we have baked in from an overall... Frank Dellaquila : Yes. I would expect, Joe, this is Frank. I would expect it\u2019ll be in the mid-40s, 50s, EBITDA percent over the full year for AspenTech. It\u2019s very seasonal. And as Ram said, this is a low quarter but the business is very profitable when it leverages. Operator : The next question comes from Brett Linzey from Mizuho. Brett Linzey : Congratulations. Just want to come back to the operating leverage. So you\u2019re guiding mid- to high 30s for the continuing ops in \u201823. Could you maybe just unbundle that in terms of how we should think about the volume incrementals versus price cost and other maybe any efficiencies that are getting ironed out for next year. Lal Karsanbhai : No, I think Ram had voiced this correctly earlier. We expect somewhere around 2 to 3 points of price, the remainder of this coming from volume and then that mid- to high 30s on the leverage. That's a significant move up from our historical guidance which has been at 30% on that operating leverage and we feel comfortable with this new portfolio to guide significantly higher. Brett Linzey : Okay, great. And just a quick follow-up. I wanted to come back to the sales outlook, too. So it looks like you're guiding Q1 at 7%, full year, 7.5% at the midpoint. So that does suggest you expect that rate of growth to build despite the comps getting a little bit difficult in the second half. Is this just backlog timing or something about mix we should be thinking about in the model? Frank Dellaquila : No, it\u2019s primarily the timing of the backlog and how it comes through the conversion process, so we do expect some moderate acceleration as we go through the year. Operator : The next question comes from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Joe O'Dea: I wanted to ask on the pipeline of reshoring activity. And if you could go into a more detail across the end markets, maybe where you see the strongest opportunities there, things outside of batteries and semiconductors and also just vis-\u00e0-vis kind of elevated macro uncertainty, whether you\u2019re seeing any pause in some of that planning and how you\u2019re thinking about the sort of timeline around that pipeline? Lal Karsanbhai : No, great question. Thank you. In terms of nearshoring, I think you mentioned 2 very important ones, battery manufacturing and semiconductor. But the third that I would ask you to consider it will be life sciences, particularly around drug reshoring personalized medicine. We're seeing significant investments, not just in the United States but in Europe, that development and manufacturing comes in from Asia. In terms of the macro environment, I think the one caution I would express is Europe and that is really around energy costs in Europe and the challenges, particularly to energy-intensive industries such as discrete or in the chemical industry as examples. Operator : The next question comes from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : Congratulations, guys. Just a quick one on AS end market trends. So orders did fall a little bit this quarter. I\u2019m sure comps is a big part of that. But \u2013 if you could talk a little bit Lal or anyone about what you\u2019re seeing in the business with the key end markets, definitely oil and gas, too. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. No, good question. Yes, comps have gotten more challenging, clearly but we have tremendous momentum in the business in terms of orders as we go into the year, particularly in North America. And that's really the big driver which gives us even more confidence, Nicole to guide aggressively as we go into 2023. The North America growth is driven by energy investments that I talked about earlier, particularly LNG is driven by sustainability in new energy sources, conversions, refineries into clean fuels, new hydrogen investments and overall decarbonization work that's been done across multiple industries on the continent. And then secondly, the second category would be the near-shoring industries we just mentioned, semiconductor investments, life science investments, battery EV investments drive a significant amount of that growth. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session and the conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Colleen Mettler, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Colleen Mettler : Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for joining us for Emerson's first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings conference call. Today, I'm joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; Chief Financial Officer, Frank Dellaquila; and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Please join me on Slide 2. This presentation may include forward-looking statements, which contain a degree of business risks and uncertainties. Please take time to read the safe harbor statement and note on the non-GAAP measures. I will now pass the call over to Emerson President and CEO, Lal Karsanbhai, for opening remarks. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Colleen. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'd like to begin by thanking the global Emerson family for delivering yet another strong operational quarter. I'd also like to extend my appreciation to our Board of Directors and the shareholders of Emerson for your continued confidence in this management team. We remain confident about the strength of our markets from both a geographic and an industry perspective. This is exemplified by our project funnel that continues to grow, exceeding $7 billion at the end of the quarter. Before I turn the call over and discuss the quarter's performance, in review of our strong outlook for the second quarter and the year, I'd like to say a few words about our headquarters announcement this morning. We conducted a comprehensive three-month review of location options. St. Louis was selected following this rigorous process, and we look forward now to finding an appropriate location in the region. Please turn to Slide 3. Operationally, the first quarter was very strong for Emerson. End market demand remains strong as first quarter order trajectory played out largely as planned. 5% underlying orders was as expected as broad automation strength was weighed down slightly by a double-digit decline in safety and productivity orders against tough comps. Sequential underlying orders were also up 6% versus the September end quarter. Sales met our expectations at 6% underlying growth, slightly impacted by shutdowns in China. Our business performed very well operationally, displaying the strength of our Emerson management system. Operating leverage, excluding AspenTech was 40% and ahead of our mid to high 30s expectation. Adjusted EPS was $0.78 for the quarter and was impacted by two main below-the-line items. Stock compensation was a $0.09 headwind versus 2022, driven by a 31% stock price increase throughout the quarter and its subsequent impact on the remaining mark-to-market plan. While we expect a slight headwind from the addition of AspenTech's stock comp rolling into our financials, the overall stock compensation headwind was 8% worse than anticipated. Frank will provide more color on this in his section. Similarly, FX was worse than originally expected. However, despite these headwinds, operations performed above guidance as our business continued to execute. Lastly, we completed our committed $2 billion of share repurchase in the first quarter. Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to walk through some exciting successes and the strong momentum we see in the value creation priorities we laid out on November 29. First, in late January, we visited the Middle East and had the opportunity to break ground on our new state-of-the-art innovation and manufacturing hub in Saudi Arabia. This investment is designed to not only spur innovation for the region, focusing on the transition to clean energy segments like hydrogen and clean fuels, but also demonstrates our commitment to our regionalization strategy and best cost manufacturing. Pillars of our operational excellence. As an example of the projects our investment will supply, Emerson was chosen to provide automation for the world's largest green hydrogen facility by NEOM. The plant will provide 600 tons a day of green hydrogen using Emerson Automation technology throughout production processes and renewable power generation. Emerson's local support and installed base in the Middle East were key differentiators. Secondly, Emerson and AspenTech continue to succeed with our joint customer solutions. In the first quarter, we were jointly selected to automate the Middle East's largest ethane facility by QatarEnergy and Chevron Phillips, Ras Laffan. Emerson will serve as the main automation contractor for the $6 billion facility, providing our leading DeltaV control system with AspenTech engineering and simulation products. The project is a scale example of our commercial agreement with AspenTech and how it successfully provides an expanded differentiated product offering to customers. Lastly, Emerson continues to diversify through life sciences and metals and mining markets. In the first quarter, Emerson was awarded the automation contract for FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies in Europe. The expansion project will include multiple bioreactors and processing streams, one of the largest CDMOs in Europe. These three projects are a clear demonstration of Emerson's commitment to the growth platforms we discussed at our investor conference, and our continued success differentiating as an automation leader in these markets. Before I turn the call over to Frank, I wanted to briefly discuss our proposal to acquire National Instruments for $53 per share in cash. As you know, we made our offer public on January 17 and our correspondence with NI since 2022, May, is available on maximizing value at ni.com. Emerson is committed to an acquisition of NI and is participating in the strategic review process. We believe our premium all-cash proposal with no financing conditions or anticipated regulatory concerns is compelling and in the best interest of Emerson and NI shareholders. We look forward to continued engagement with NI and its advisers and moving swiftly towards an agreed transaction. That said, the focus of this call is our performance for the quarter, and we're not going to be commenting further on our proposal for NI at this time. Be assured that we'll continue to execute financial diligence as we review these opportunities. With that, I will now turn the call over to Frank. Frank Dellaquila : Thank you, Lal, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. As Lal mentioned, we had a very strong operational start to 2023. Underlying sales were within our expectations for the quarter at 6%, driven by 10% growth in software and control and 5% in Intelligent Devices. Net sales were up 7% with a four-point drag from currency and a five-point contribution from AspenTech. World area growth was led by the Americas, which was up 13%, driven by strong process sales, particularly in energy and chemical. The continued energy crisis in Europe, affected demand as underlying sales were below prior year by 2%. However, sales were up 7% after adjusting for the impact of Russia. Sales in Asia, Middle East and Africa were flat versus prior year, as strength in the Middle East, driven by chemical and energy investments was offset by dam sales in China, mainly due to challenging year-on-year comparisons and sporadic code-related shutdowns. By industry, we continue to see strength in later cycle markets like energy and chemical. Chemical investments and plant modernization and sustainability remains steady in North America and Asia, but we are keeping a close eye on this market as we assess our outlook for the balance of 2023. Overall, first quarter process industry sales were up high single-digits. Similarly, hybrid sales were up high single-digits, led by continued investments in life sciences reshoring and metals and mining. Discrete sales were up mid single-digits as this earlier cycle business starts to lap more difficult comps. The growth in discrete was offset by weakness in our commercial business in safety and productivity, which was down 10% for the quarter, but with early signs that we are bottoming out. Overall, we feel confident about the health of our end markets and our conversations with customers indicate continued growth in investments during 2023. Price during the quarter contributed four points as our pricing actions from 2022 and additional actions taken at the beginning of 2023, are driving strong price realization. Backlog grew approximately $700 million during the quarter to $6.6 billion, giving us ample opportunity to execute on the rest of the fiscal year plan. Adjusted segment EBITDA margin improved by 130 basis points and leverage was 40%, excluding AspenTech. North America mix contributed to the margin expansion and price was accretive to margin in the quarter. Software and control margins were up 200 basis points, led by AspenTech. Intelligent Devices performance was strong with 110 basis points of adjusted EBITDA expansion. Adjusted EPS was $0.78, and I'll discuss the details when we move to the next chart. Lastly, on this chart, free cash flow of $243 million was down 20% year-over-year, mainly due to trade working capital, including the impact of supply chain performance, which is improving, but is still challenged. We are focused on improving trade working capital as we progress through the year, and we reiterate our expectation of 100% free cash flow conversion for the full year. Turning to Slide 6. This is our adjusted EPS bridge versus the prior year. First, I wanted to say that we had very strong operational results, again, reflecting low-40s leverage on incremental sales, which delivered $0.15 to adjusted EPS in the quarter. There was an unfavorable impact due to stock compensation as Lal said of $0.09 and an additional $0.09 due to currency. The stock comp impact was primarily due to our legacy long-term incentive plans, which required mark-to-market treatment on recorded expense of the 31% increase in our stock price during the quarter. The last of these plans will run off in 2023 and the new plans do not require mark-to-market accounting. So going forward, the variability from stock comp will be dramatically reduced in 2024 and beyond from what it has been historically. Currency in the quarter was primarily driven by the accounting treatment of our long-term contracts in addition to customary translation and transaction impacts. Other non-operating items and share repurchase contributed $0.02 through the quarter. Please turn to Slide 7. Turning to our 2023 outlook. We continue to see strength across our end markets. As we communicated in October, process, hybrid and discrete markets are all expected to grow mid to high-single digits in 2023. The long-term secular trends we discussed in November continue to be relevant for our business and are driving growth and successes in 2023. Energy transition spend continues to be strong as evidenced by the successes Lal highlighted a few minutes ago. Energy security investments, including LNG continue to accelerate especially in North America and the Middle East. In hybrid, life sciences investments due to reshoring continue to move forward and metals and mining spend is centered around electric vehicles and electrification value chains. Those value chains are also benefiting discrete markets, especially in the U.S. The one weakness we see in the business today is our commercial exposure within the Safety and Productivity segment, which was down 10% in the first quarter. We expect these sales to improve as we move throughout the year as we face easier comparisons and we see early signs of a turn in demand. Please turn to Slide 8. We\u2019re maintaining our full year guidance based on the underlying strength in our end markets and robust backlog. The guide for underlying sales growth remains at 6.5% to 8.5%. We now expect currency to be less of a headwind at 2 points, and AspenTech is expected to contribute 3.5 points. Therefore, we are increasing our net sales expectations to 8% to 10% of a point from the previous guide. We are holding operating leverage, adjusted EPS and free cash flow conversion for the year at the previous guide. Within that guide, we intend to cover the unexpected stock comp headwind that we had in the first quarter with excellent operational performance. For the second quarter, we expect underlying sales growth of 8% to 10%. Currency continues to be a headwind, reducing sales growth by approximately 3 points. AspenTech will contribute approximately 5.5 points and net sales are expected to be 10.5% to 12.5% up. Leverage expectations again are in the mid to high-30s. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be between $0.95 and $1, which is a 13% increase at the mid-point of the guide. We\u2019ve included quarterly data for 2022 on a continuing ops basis in our press release and in the 8-K that was filed this morning. Thank you for your attention, and we\u2019ll now turn it over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research. You may now go ahead. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, Lal and Frank and Ram and Colleen. Lal Karsanbhai : Hey Scott. Frank Dellaquila : Good morning. Colleen Mettler : Good morning. Scott Davis : Couple little clean up items since I think these slides are pretty clear, but was price predominantly \u2013 you think about the total growth in the quarter, 6% was price. Does price make up most of that? Lal Karsanbhai : Hey Scott, good morning. Lal here. Yes, in the quarter, price accounted for 4 points approximately out of the 6, 2 points of volume. Scott Davis : And did that cover costs, Lal? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, sir. Scott Davis : Okay. And just a quick follow-up here on life sciences. I know some of your peers have seen some weakness in life sciences, but you guys made some pretty positive comments relating to that end market. Can you be \u2013 or just give us a little bit more color on what your customers are spending money on. You mentioned localization, but perhaps a little bit more color there would be helpful. Thanks. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. No, a very active quarter in life sciences globally, Asia, Southeast Asia, United States, East Coast and Europe, a variety of projects we chose one to highlight with you today. It\u2019s predominantly around automation. It\u2019s expansion of capacity. It\u2019s driven by the trends that we discussed at our investor conference, whether it\u2019s personalized medicine, or capacity derisking in the world areas. We have yet, Scott, to expand with a full offering of AspenTech into the space that\u2019s in development and will be released to you shortly, but that will give us another avenue as we bring optimization software into that space. Scott Davis : Okay. Helpful. Best of luck this year guys. Thank you. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Scott. Frank Dellaquila : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. You may now go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning, everybody. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just a couple of questions, both relating to kind of orders pipeline backlog and the conversions there. I guess while backlog has not had kind of this enormous surge that you\u2019ve seen maybe in some other names that had a tougher time on supply chain, but how do you think about backlog conversion in your guidance? Is the expectation that orders start to moderate versus accelerate? Where would you be pleased to see backlog over the next 12 months? And then sort of a second related question, how do you feel about kind of the pipeline of projects today and the pace at which things are looking out of those? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. No, backlog did increase in the quarter as we went through. Look, I do feel very confident with the order pacing in the businesses with the weakness only in the Safety Productivity segment that we described throughout the call. Beyond that, the funnel is very robust. It actually grew almost $500 million in terms of size, as we went through the quarter to about $7.3 billion globally, a large number of sustainability projects, large number of energy transition projects. And we\u2019re executing very well in that capital formation cycle. So feel very good about that. So look, I think from an orders perspective, my expectation is we continue to see a very positive environment as we go through the year. And our job here, and I think it\u2019s embedded in our second quarter guidance to convert the backlog that we have in the business. Josh Pokrzywinski : Great. If I could just get one little follow-up on there. How do you feel about kind of the margin that you guys are seeing on some of these larger projects? I know people think about mega projects and margin erosion aggressive bidding. Has that been your experience with this wave? Lal Karsanbhai : No. You see the leverage that we gained in the quarter, about 40 points. There were project shipments within the quarter embedded in it. We feel very, very good about our differentiating capabilities with our technology stack. Yes, there\u2019s competitive bidding, but it\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary that we\u2019ve seen and nothing that we can\u2019t manage within our pricing models. Josh Pokrzywinski : Correct. Great. Appreciate the color. Best of luck. Operator : Our next question will come from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. You may now go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning. Andy Kaplowitz : Lal, I just want to follow-up on the last question in terms of when I look at orders, have you seen any bigger signs of deceleration activity anywhere outside of Safety and Productivity? I know you mentioned you\u2019re watching chemicals. I think Antonio also mentioned that. Would you expect orders to hold in chemicals? Or any of the other process markets? And orders continue to be focused in the Americas, as you\u2019ve said in the past. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, good question. We had a really good Americas quarter and strong momentum there, a very strong Western Europe quarter with great momentum there. Of course, Eastern Europe is relative weakness because of Russia, of course, as we walked away from that market. So the comparables there were pretty tough. And then Asia and the Middle East, very strong. Of course, China was down for us in the quarter, but we see that coming back here in the second quarter and expect high-single digits as we finish out the year. So generally, Andy, based on what we\u2019re seeing beyond the Safety Productivity segment, I feel very confident about not just the second quarter guide we put out there, but the full year at this point. Ram, any color? Ram Krishnan : Yes. I think Western Europe being resilient is very positive for us. And then the KOB3 business, which is now close to 65% of our total sales mix in the new company has been very strong. So that\u2019s a good sign and Andy, the project funnel is building. So at this point, in the core business outside of Safety and Productivity, no signs of weaknesses. Andy Kaplowitz : Very helpful, guys. And then you talked about this a little bit, but you delivered incrementals of 40%. You mentioned the major reason is that positive mix from strength in the Americas. Is there any reason why that would change as you go throughout the year? And I know you talked a bit about price, but did price versus costs come in a little bit better than you would have thought for Q1? And could that continue for the year? Ram Krishnan : Yes. I think we\u2019re going to see strong price cost through the year. And frankly, with fundamentally price holding at high levels and like we saw in the first quarter, but also coupled with commodities softening as we go into the second half as we see both commodities as well as logistics turn favorable. So I think really, the margin performance in Q1 is, yes, Americas mix, but also strong price cost, which should continue through the year. And we don\u2019t expect North America sales to soften through the year. So the dynamics we saw in Q1 should continue through the year. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate it guys. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Andy. Operator : Our next question will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. You may now go ahead. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Look, I know it\u2019s a happy day in St. Louis. Emerson has had such an important presence in the community for so many years. So I\u2019m sure that\u2019s great news for everybody. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Deane. I think we\u2019re all pretty excited about the decision and the process that we went through. Deane Dray : And it also avoids the logistics and disruptions and so forth. So that\u2019s great to hear. My question, it would be for Frank. For reaffirming the free cash flow conversion, 100% for the year, what has to change in working capital? We\u2019re still seeing such across the industrials. The buffer inventory required with supply chains are still chewing up enough of working capital that you\u2019re seeing lots of underperformance on free cash flow. So how do you see this playing out? Frank Dellaquila : Yes, good morning, Deane. Mainly, it\u2019s an inventory story. It has to be around getting the backlog out in order to get the inventory down and supply chain is adjusting and improving but in ways that aren\u2019t always helpful in terms of difficulty and timing, receipts of materials. So that\u2019s the fundamental thing that needs to change is that we need to get the inventory out over the next three quarters. And a big part of that will be shipping the backlog that we have, and we certainly have a robust backlog level. So it\u2019s about execution now going forward. Ram and I discuss that in detail with our businesses when we had our quarterly ops reviews and I\u2019m sure Ram can comment a little further on the supply chain implications. Ram Krishnan : Yes. Frank, you said it. I mean at the end of the day, I think right now, we were somewhat positively surprised at the pace in which the supply chain delivered in the first quarter. So I think that was one of the reasons inventory built, but that\u2019s, in some ways, good news that positions us to execute on the backlog in the remainder of the three quarters and that remains the focus. And obviously, we\u2019ll make slight adjustments in optimizing how we drive material in from our supply chains, given that they\u2019re performing better. But ultimately, it will come down to execution of the backlog, which we\u2019re poised to do. Deane Dray : Great. And then just as a follow-up, and I know there\u2019s not been any specifics provided yet is what\u2019s the potential for other portfolio moves more in the way of cleanup we could point to some businesses that would be less core under the new automation pure-play framework. It\u2019s just \u2013 maybe you can just comment on the willingness of the Board to look at this and potential timing in terms of monetization of those businesses. Lal Karsanbhai : That\u2019s great question. We\u2019re \u2013 we voiced in our November 2019 Investor Conference that we\u2019re going to be active managers of the portfolio, and that is inclusive of both the opportunities to build on the cohesive automation company, but also to continue to prune where and when necessary. At this point, we don\u2019t have an impetus to do so, but we\u2019ll continue to pursue critical bolt-on acquisitions. Of course, the NII pursuit that I \u2013 that you\u2019re aware of. But we\u2019re also continuing to look at the existing portfolio. But I would not expect anything of scale there after a very busy 2022. Deane Dray : Got it. Thank you. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. You may now go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. I think we\u2019ve had sort of good top-down color. So maybe trying to look at some of the segment pieces a little bit. Maybe on safety and productivity, just starting there. I realize it\u2019s quite a small business for you, but I guess two questions on it. One was just talk a little bit about how you see the slope of the organic sales playing out the balance of the year? And then secondly, the margins were up, I think, 100 points in that business year-on-year despite a weak revenue performance. So maybe help us understand how you delivered that and is it sustainable? Ram Krishnan : Yes. Julian, Ram here. In terms of the buildup of the sales, I think Q2 will be negative, but we anticipate it going positive in the second half or close to a flat year for the full year. That\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re looking at safety and productivity. The margin improvement clearly driven by \u2013 we had some focused restructuring that we executed in that business, anticipating the slowdown second half of last year and then favorable price cost performance, certainly strong price in the business close to 9 points of price in Q1. Obviously, the cost savings flowing through and then softening materials or material costs as we get into the second half should drive continued strong margin performance in the business through the year. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you, Ram. And then secondly, just on the discrete business. You grew, I think, 6 points in the quarter. Maybe remind us kind of what your main areas of strength are in discrete, whether it\u2019s by vertical? And I assume there\u2019s a lot of domestic business and also Europe in there. And also, I think you mentioned briefly some early cycle elements softening. So maybe expand on that a little bit and whether you see the discrete business kind of holding that 6% growth rate through the balance of the year? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. We have a very balanced business from a global perspective, Julian. We saw a broad strength in the United States, both into direct OEM business as well as through our distribution networks. That continues to be very robust. No signs of weakness there, although we\u2019re watching that very carefully in terms of stocking levels and other elements. Our Western European business, which I cited earlier, was very strong in the quarter, heavily driven by \u2013 within the discrete business as well. It\u2019s particularly in places like France and Germany, which are critical markets for us. And then lastly, in Asia, outside of China, a very strong market. And now with China recovering feel that we are well positioned there. From a technology perspective, again, very good growth on the automation on the control side, PLCs and industrial PCs, and of course, with the various devices around material movement in the plants. Ram, any color for Julian? Ram Krishnan : No. I think \u2013 I mean, from a segment perspective, we broadly have factory automation and industrial automation segments within the business. So both those continue to do very well. And frankly, I think we anticipate mid to high single-digit growth for the year in that business overall. The 6% was somewhat impacted by shutdowns in China, which that business experienced. So frankly, we expect that to improve as we go through the year. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s great, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. You may now go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning. Frank Dellaquila : Good morning. Jeff Sprague : Maybe a housekeeping one for me first and then I want to come back to some of the projects, but just can we put a finer point on comp and FX? So the $0.09 headwind, it seems like you expected the $0.01 headwind. Can we just clarify what was \u2013 what is assumed for the entire year and how that\u2019s changed versus your original expectations? And then on FX, so you\u2019re saying in addition to just kind of normal translation headwinds, there was some contract or other backlog adjustments. Could you just elaborate on that a little bit? Frank Dellaquila : Yes. Good morning, Jeff. It\u2019s Frank. Yes. So on FX, I mean, we originally had low double-digit impact on current \u2013 on the \u2013 from currency for the year in the guide back in October. That\u2019s moderated. It\u2019s probably in the $0.05 to $0.10 range now. So I mean, we have a little bit of an improvement there based on the turn in the dollar. And then you asked again about stock comp as well. So yes, there, we had built in a little bit of an increase in the addition of AspenTech and more or less flattish for the quarter for Emerson, and then we had the mark-to-market impact that was driven by the 30%-odd increase in the stock price on the legacy plans. So that was entirely incremental to what we had in the guide, $0.09 year-over-year and kind of $0.07 or $0.08 versus the guide. So that\u2019s the big headwind we had there, which we are \u2013 which is now kind of embedded in the year, and we will just absorb that and overcome it within the year guide. Jeff Sprague : And just on the projects law, interesting couple you call out here. Could you just maybe give us a sense of kind of the dollar scope of some of these large benchmark product \u2013 project like this, maybe the green hydrogen project, what your content looks like on the front end and maybe what the tail of a project looks like? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. No, these fall very much within the parameters, Jeff, that we laid out in terms of automation dollars per gigawatt as we think about hydrogen, for example. 600,000 \u2013 I think it\u2019s \u2013 I believe it\u2019s 600,000 per gigawatt is what we laid out, if I\u2019m not mistaken, Ram? But on the petrochemicals \u2013 and for example, ethylene, again, KOB1, very significant there in the $20 million to $30 million type of scale. And then, of course, there\u2019s all the downstream and the instrumentation business to come. So, some of these are very sizable. The specific one that we highlighted, of course, about $50 million in first purchase, which is the DeltaV system and then there\u2019s further instrumentation to come. So they\u2019re very sizable in terms of scale, but in line with how we think about dollars of automation per capacity, depending on the market they\u2019re in. Jeff Sprague : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. You may now go ahead. Steve Tusa : Hi. Good morning. Ram Krishnan : Good morning. Steve Tusa : Can you guys just talk about maybe some guidance for Aspen in particular, especially the cash flow coming in the next couple of quarters? How confident you are in that? And where you see that coming in? Frank Dellaquila : Yes. Steve, you cut out a little bit \u2013 this is Frank. You cut out a little bit at the beginning of your question. I mean, again... Steve Tusa : Aspen free cash flow. Yes, Aspen free cash flow and how confident in moving forward\u2026 Frank Dellaquila : We didn\u2019t hear or I didn\u2019t hear. Ram Krishnan : Yes. I mean, Steve, I think \u2013 go ahead. On plan. Frank Dellaquila : Yes, on plan, very seasonal. So their fourth quarter, our third quarter will be a big cash flow quarter. And we see and we \u2013 based on the plan, we think they\u2019ll deliver it as they have in the past, so it will be heavily in that quarter. Ram Krishnan : Yes. On guide, Steve, I think \u2013 and third quarter for them will be \u2013 or our third quarter will be the big quarter. Frank Dellaquila : Yes. I mean, obviously, they can provide the color and the background on that. But I mean, that is the seasonal pattern for their cash flow, and we would expect that to maintain. Steve Tusa : Right. Yes, it does influence your cash. So just curious if you guys \u2013 the owners have a view on that. When it comes to NATI, how coveted is this asset for you guys? I mean it doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019re going to take anything below $60. Is \u2013 are you guys really willing kind of go to the wall for this? Lal Karsanbhai : I can be very clear with you, then we\u2019re not going to be the purchaser of the asset. Steve Tusa : That is a definitive answer. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question will come from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. You may now go ahead. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks. Good morning. Okay. I won\u2019t be asking questions on the NATI purchase price, so I\u2019ll move on from that. Just want to go back to FX, if I can. I think you mentioned long-term contract marks, and it\u2019s not something I\u2019ve heard from Emerson before. So I know we\u2019ve had some backlog revaluation. So just maybe talk about what caused that to that mark on FX? And maybe just on the below line stuff, what is the normalized stock comp beyond this year once we roll off this plan? How should we size that? Frank Dellaquila : Okay. So Nigel, hi. This is Frank. So the \u2013 yes, we had a significant \u2013 of the currency that was in the quarter, a significant portion of it was due to the impact of the accounting on long-term contracts. So you have to mark-to-market long-term contracts. Typically, these are to EPCs, and they tend to be in places like Korea and other markets where we typically are in talking about currency as opposed to translation currency when we talk about Europe and China. And the accounting basically brings those marks to zero when the contract closes out, but during the life of the contract, you mark-to-market up and down. And depending on where you are in the life cycle of a contract and what the backfill is for those contracts, you\u2019ll get a mark most quarters, it\u2019s not big enough to matter. This quarter, it was $0.04 or $0.05, so it was big enough to matter and that\u2019s what drives it. And we try not to talk about it, the word \u2013 it\u2019s embedded derivatives. We don\u2019t talk about embedded derivatives because it\u2019s just not helpful, but that\u2019s specifically the accounting that drives that mark on long-term contracts. Nigel Coe : Okay. Yes, embedded derivatives, above my pay grade. So let\u2019s move on from that, but we\u2019ll follow up offline. But on the \u2013 just on the guide, so there\u2019s some moving pieces here. So it feels like FX is very neutral. The weaker dollar offset by some of these marks probably got some share buyback benefits relative to plan, well, certainly versus our model and then we have the stock comp offset. Is that sort of the major moving piece? Is there anything else you\u2019d highlight? And then maybe just talk about the sales acceleration. We\u2019ve got some China noise in the back half of the year with the lockdowns in the prior year. But what kind of macro environment you\u2019re planning for, especially in second quarter fiscal, some of your short-cycle peers are highlighting some inventory corrections, et cetera. What do you see in discrete markets and some of the other relevant markets? Ram Krishnan : Yes. So I\u2019ll take a crack, Ram here, on the sales. From a sales perspective, obviously, we have acceleration built in to the year, fundamentally with orders holding in the mid-single digits and us shipping backlog that we described with improving supply chain. So certainly, Q2, Q3 and into Q4 we\u2019ll expect the ramp-up in absolute sales as we execute on the backlog. In terms of distributor destocking, we haven\u2019t seen it in any of our businesses. Certainly, a lot of our discrete businesses go through distributors. Some of our process businesses go through distributors. We haven\u2019t seen it and nor do we anticipate it just given the dynamics of what we\u2019re seeing. And then to top it off, price will remain strong through the year that will contribute to growth as well. Nigel Coe : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may now go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Hey guys. Can you just touch on AspenTech a little bit? I know, Lal, you mentioned some of the wins [indiscernible] that was interesting. But like how is that going thus far? And then I noticed that the adjusted EBITDA margin was a tough lighter than what you guys expect for a full year basis. Maybe just provide some color around seasonality in that business as well. Ram Krishnan : Yes. So AspenTech, I think for us, from a synergy perspective, going according to plan. And frankly, a lot of the early synergies we\u2019ve built in is on projects like Ras Laffan where Aspen won some very, very good content. I think the sales channels and the engagement of our sales channel and selling their capabilities continues as planned. Now really what we\u2019re driving there is in terms of perpetual licenses and bundling them on projects, a lot of success converting our wins into ACV type of revenue for AspenTech is a work in process and should pick up momentum as we go into the second half of the year. So we feel pretty good about the synergies. We certainly feel pretty good about the sales forecast we\u2019ve built in for AspenTech. Obviously, the plan they presented and the plan we\u2019ve built in into the consolidated Emerson numbers, and then no concerns on the margin performance, the EBITDA performance. Seasonally, their third quarter or their fourth quarter, our third quarter is the biggest quarter. It was last year, and it will again be this year. Joe Ritchie : Super helpful, Ram. And then maybe my follow-on question. While, at the Investor Day, you guys highlighted all of these big opportunities in automation technology and you talked about your pipeline extending. I\u2019m just wondering where have you seen the most movement recently in terms of your pipeline and those opportunities? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. No, it\u2019s a good question. Of course, we did have a very active quarter in terms of the project funnel and particularly not just in projects that were booked and hence exited the funnel, but also in the build-up what we saw in terms of activity. I would suggest that the predominant element of growth came in two areas : One is life sciences, which grew significantly in the funnel in the quarter; and secondly, the energy transition, which continues to be very robust, both here in the U.S. and in the Middle East predominantly and became additive to the funnel. And that funnel grew not just in terms of dollars by about $0.5 billion, but also in terms of number of projects, but only by eight projects, which tells you that the average size of projects are getting larger, which is also a dimension here. Ram Krishnan : And the only thing I would add is the LNG size of the funnel remains large, meaningful. And what we saw in the last quarter was a good momentum on the FID progress associated with many LNG projects in the U.S. where we\u2019re very, very well positioned. A lot of these are going through Bechtel, in Texas and Louisiana. And our expectation is, we will ramp up order booking activity in those \u2013 on those projects as we go through the second half of the year. Joe Ritchie : Great. Nice to hear. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Joe O\u2019Dea with Wells Fargo. You may now go ahead. Joe O\u2019Dea: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start on sort of price and price cost. On the price cost side of things, can you size the margin impact in the quarter? And then what you\u2019re thinking about for the cadence of that impact over the course of the year? And I think you also noted some price increases to start 2023. Is that broad-based? Are those more concentrated in parts of the business? Frank Dellaquila : You want to talk about the price increases? Ram Krishnan : Yes. So from a \u2013 I\u2019ll take a crack at the price increases. I mean, we did have a good price increase in October, we typically do as we enter the fiscal year. Select product lines had price increases in Jan. We have a few more product lines slated for midyear price increases around the April time frame. In general, though, I think pricing was 4% realized price in the first quarter. We expect it to stay at those levels as we go through the year. So pricing will remain strong. Frank Dellaquila : As we go through the year, we expect those price increases as they roll through will continue to be accretive to margin. Through the entire year, it was bigger in the first quarter than it will be [ph] as we go through the year. Again, then we\u2019ll see what incremental price increases we might put through. Net material inflation also should become a tailwind in the back half of the year. So all in all accretive, somewhere between half point and the point, it really depends on how it rolls through, but certainly a good story from a margin standpoint as we go through the year. Joe O\u2019Dea: Got it. And then I wanted to circle back on some of the Discrete questions and just kind of bigger picture macro. And I think that the industry outlook for Discrete up mid-single digits. I assume that\u2019s sort of a combination of kind of low-single digit price, low-single digit volume would expect areas like batteries and semiconductors are growing faster than that. But when we think about what we\u2019re seeing on sort of the PMI side of things and then thinking about sort of Discrete just growing through a PMI slowdown. I mean, can you touch on as the expectations sort of outside of some of these structural growth areas that we just continue to see some kind of low-single digit volume growth and sort of no kind of connection there between some short cycle macro indicators of slowing, but not really seeing it in your end markets? Ram Krishnan : Yes. So you said most of it. I think that the plan really is LSD, low-single digit price, low-single digit volume, the growth vectors \u2013 semiconductors, battery manufacturing, frankly from a sector that we are cautious on automotive is something we\u2019re going to have to carefully watch. We have had good performance so far. But automotive is an area that we have to watch very carefully. And then our stocking levels in terms of distribution, again, we haven\u2019t seen any slowdown yet. But certainly to your point, based on the PMI forecast and what is anticipated there could be slowing in that sector. So if you put all that together, I think we feel pretty good about our mid-single digit forecast. Joe O\u2019Dea: Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question will come from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. You may now go ahead. Christopher Glynn : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just wanted to tie a little bit the organic outlook versus backlog growth up $700 million suggests the 1.2 book-to-bill which seems a little incongruous with 5% orders growth. But I suppose that\u2019s a function of the prior year book-to-bill. So just wondering if you could comment on that book-to-bill interpretation and how do you characterize backlog size versus what you might consider normal in a moderately expanding net end market mix? Ram Krishnan : Yes. So I think the $700 million is a GAAP number. The 5% is an underlying sales number. But net-net, you are right. If you looked at the first quarter of last year and calibrated versus orders and sales, I think the 5% makes sense with the $700 million build in backlog. I think our expectation for a normalized level of backlog in this business. We\u2019re probably at least close to $800 million to $1 billion too high in terms of where we could normally be \u2013 if the supply chain were optimal. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to have to execute through the year. And as the supply chain continues to improve, that\u2019s the normalized level of backlog for this level of sales. So to answer your question directly, it\u2019s about $800 million to $1 billion higher than what we would\u2019ve anticipated. Christopher Glynn : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. You may now go ahead. Gautam Khanna : Yes. Thank you. Good morning, guys. Ram Krishnan : Good morning. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning. Gautam Khanna : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the aftermarket, the KOB 3 stuff. I think you said it was 65% of sales in the quarter. But where do you see that trending over the next year or year and a half because it seems like it\u2019s been on full tilt for quite a while? Just what do you think the new normal is? Frank Dellaquila : Yes. No, I think we\u2019ve had a concerted effort across our business to maximize the value of the $130 billion plus installed base. And those are programs that we\u2019ll put in place that drive service MRO and replacement opportunities. We\u2019re sitting at, you\u2019re right, right around 65%. I expect that to remain within that range. And it\u2019s supported by the business programs that we have in the operating companies. Ram Krishnan : And I would add that\u2019s the segment of the business where the pricing flows through at higher levels. So obviously that will remain robust through the year. Gautam Khanna : I appreciate it. And then just to follow up, any change the timing of the divestment out there on Climate Tech, anything noteworthy? Lal Karsanbhai : No, we\u2019re still thinking about the first half of this calendar year and everything\u2019s on track in terms of the regulatory approvals and standing up the business. So that\u2019s all well underway, so we\u2019d expect April may shifts as a guideline there. Gautam Khanna : Thanks, guys. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, sir. Operator : Our next question will come from Tommy Moll with Stephens. You may now go ahead. Tommy Moll : Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning. Ram Krishnan : Good morning. Tommy Moll : I wanted to start on the industry outlook you provided across process, hybrid, discrete, little variation across the three, but essentially all growing nicely in the single digit range. There are others in some of these markets that have double digit outlooks versus the singles that you provide, I am well aware there\u2019s often apple and orange impacts here in making comparisons. But I was just curious, is there any conservatism embedded in these outlooks you\u2019ve provided? Is there anything you would do to help us reconcile some of what we\u2019ve heard elsewhere? Thanks. Lal Karsanbhai : In terms of the market outlooks, Tommy, we feel that we\u2019ve given a very balanced view of what\u2019s out there. The blend of the different types of businesses that we cover in terms of capital modernizations and replacement. We\u2019ve also taken into account that the various geographic trends. But no, I feel that what we\u2019ve put there ties into the guide for the quarter and of course our expectations for the year as well. And again, within each of the segments, as you recognize, there are big pluses and smaller pluses clearly in the Discrete space, which we\u2019ve been speaking about to a significant amount today. EV semiconductor elements like that, of course have a significantly higher growth than some others. But overall, I feel that the indications we\u2019ve given are fair based on what we\u2019ve seen this in the marketplace today. Tommy Moll : Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. I also wanted to ask about the repurchase activity. Is it fair to say that the deployment of the full 2 billion in the quarter was an acceleration versus the original plan? And if so was that \u2013 should we view that more as an opportunistic decision where your stock was under pressure for a period of time? You decided to lean in and to the extent that\u2026 Frank Dellaquila : Yes. I\u2019m sorry, Tommy, this is Frank. No, not really. When we communicated the 2 billion, our intent was to get it done as quickly as possible. And we were able to get it done in the quarter. So it was not really driven by market events so much as a desire to just make good on the commitment and do it quickly. Tommy Moll : And any possibility that you might revisit the potential for more later in the year, or should we think about 2023 is pretty well spoken for at this point? Frank Dellaquila : There\u2019s really no current intent to do any more share repurchase. We\u2019ve got another, other irons in the fire right now. So, obviously circumstances change. We can always revisit, but we have no current plans to revisit it right now. We said we do 2 billion and we\u2019ve done that. Tommy Moll : Great. Thank you. I\u2019ll turn it back. Frank Dellaquila : Thank you. Operator : Our last question will come from Chris Snyder with UBS. You may now go ahead. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I wanted to follow up on safety and productivity. You guys mentioned that you\u2019re seeing early signs of things bottoming out. I understand comps get easier, but it sounds like you\u2019re also starting to see demand turning, so just hoping for more color on what you\u2019re seeing to give you confidence that demand is turning there? Ram Krishnan : Yes, so I \u2013 first off, I think a majority of what we\u2019ve baked into the plan is comps getting easier. So, absolute levels stay the same with where they sit today. Price comes through and comps get easier. We\u2019ll have a better read of it as we go through the current quarter. And I think we\u2019ll have a better expectation of the second half if demand were to improve, which is not baked into the plan, we should get better numbers in safety and productivity. But at this point, it\u2019s staying at the current levels and comps getting easier. Chris Snyder : I appreciate that. And then just to follow up on China, the presentation called out a headwind from China shutdowns on organic growth in the quarter. Could you provide some more color on how China performed in the quarter? And then maybe how it\u2019s exiting into the fiscal second quarter with the reopening? Thank you. Ram Krishnan : Yes, so China was down mid-single digits, both incoming orders as well as sales performance in the quarter. And we expect China to be mid-single to high-single digits for the full year with high-single digits in the second half. Chris Snyder : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session and the conference. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference to your host, Colleen Mettler, Vice President of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead. Colleen Mettler : Good morning. And thank you for joining us for Emerson's second quarter fiscal 2023 earnings conference call. Today, I'm joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; Chief Financial Officer, Frank Dellaquila; and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan. Also joining us today is Mike Baughman, who was announced earlier this morning as our chief financial officer effective May 10. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website.  Please join me on slide 2. This presentation may include forward-looking statements, which contain a degree of business risk and uncertainties. Please take time to read the safe harbor statement and note on the non-GAAP measures. I will now pass the call over to Emerson's President and CEO, Lal Karsanbhai, for opening remarks. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Colleen. And good morning. Please turn to slide 3. I'd like to begin by thanking the global Emerson team for a tremendous performance, our board of directors and shareholders for the trust that you place in us. It has been a busy first 26 months as CEO as we reinvented Emerson. The second quarter performance was exceptional. It was a quarter in which we significantly advanced our strategic agenda across the three dimensions of our value creation model. First, culture. In the last two months, we announced two important leadership changes. Vidya Ramnath was named as the company's chief marketing officer, replacing Kathy Button Bell, who had a distinguished career at Emerson and put Emerson's brand on the map while working for three different CEOs. Vidya is the right person to accelerate our journey as a pure play automation company. She brings deep technical knowledge and customer exposure, is an engineer, and for the last four years, has led Emerson's Middle East and Africa business. We believe this is a highly differentiating move for us as a company. Secondly, this morning, we announced Frank's planned retirement and Mike Baughman as Emerson's CFO. I'll say a few more words about this later in the presentation. Lastly, we completed our first digital employee engagement survey. We heard from 85% of our global employee base and received a high quartile net engagement score. This gives us a stake in the ground and now great perspective on the areas of strength and opportunities to better the talent experience at Emerson. Second, the portfolio. We will be finalizing the Climate transaction in the current quarter. The CEO for the joint venture has been named, Ross Shuster, and we are excited by what his leadership and experience brings to the business. I'd like to thank Jamie Froedge for the work he did in the business and for his contributions, over 16 years of service at Emerson. In addition, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire National Instruments. We're very excited about the company, the technology and, most importantly, the people. This is an important point. The large portfolio moves are now complete. As an investor, you now have clarity that an investment in a share of Emerson is an investment in the leading global automation company serving a diversified set of end markets with a high growth, high profitability and cash flow, cohesive and differentiated tech stack made up of intelligent devices, control and software, led by AspenTech. Our focus on a go-forward basis, as we did this quarter, will be on creating value with this tremendous company. Lastly, our third pillar \u2013 execution. None of the work we've done would have been possible without it. The phenomenal results and momentum we have in the business is a testament to the quality of our global teams and to the strength of the Emerson management system. Underlying order were up 7% with late cycle process markets continuing to exhibit strong demand. Hybrid also remains robust, driven by reshoring investments globally. From world area perspective, Americas orders led, with China returning to growth as expected. As we look to the remainder of the year, we still feel confident in continued mid-single digit quarter growth. The strong demand and steadily improving supply chain environment enabled 14% underlying sales growth in the quarter, well above our expectations. All world areas were up double-digits, led by the Americas up 15%. Intelligent devices and software and control were also both up double-digits. This strong sales performance and the continued operational execution of our teams led to 53% operating leverage in the quarter, excluding AspenTech. Favorable impacts from mix and price costs also drove a 320 basis point improvement in adjusted segment EBITDA to 24.6%. Adjusted EPS was $1.09, beating the midpoint of guidance by $0.11, again, driven by the strong sales and operational performance. This is a 25% increase versus Q2 of 2022. Free cash flow was up 64% year-over-year and up 23% year-to-date, which is on track to meet our full year expectations. Turning to slide 4. Our value creation priorities and growth initiatives around innovation and secular growth platforms that we outlined at our investor conference in November 2022 are yielding meaningful results. First, Emerson was recognized by Fortune magazine as one of America's most innovative companies. The recognition is a testament to our innovation history and dedication from our employees to create leading technology and software for our customers. We are extremely excited to be recognized for this award and are working continuously to accelerate our innovation engine for future growth. Similarly, Emerson continues to differentiate as a leader in growth markets, like energy transition, metals and mining, and software. In the second quarter, Emerson was awarded the software and automation contract for Intermountain Power Agency's renewed power plant. The Utah project transforms a retiring coal-fired power plant into a clean energy plant running on hydrogen. At first, the plant will use a mix of 30% hydrogen, 70% natural gas before transitioning to 100% hydrogen by 2045. The hydrogen will be supplied by the Mitsubishi Power Advanced Clean Energy production and storage hub, another greenfield project that Emerson was awarded in 2022. When complete, the Intermountain project will supply six Western states with carbon free power, a critical step towards a net zero world. With our integrated end-to-end renewables and power generation platform, Emerson was chosen because of our industry expertise and proven experience in hydrogen and complex projects. Secondly, Emerson and AspenTech were jointly selected to automate and optimize the Golden Triangle Polymers facility on the Texas Gulf Coast. The $8.5 billion project is a sister facility to QatarEnergy and Chevron Phillips Ras Laffan project that we highlighted in the first quarter Emerson will provide its leading DeltaV control system and intelligent devices, and AspenTech will provide its leading simulation software. This technology will allow the facility to operate with approximately 25% lower greenhouse gas emissions than similar projects in the US and Canada. This is a great example of the differentiating strength of Emerson and AspenTech. Turning to slide 5, we remain energized and excited by our recently announced acquisition of National Instruments. National Instruments will expand our leading automation business into the attractive test and measurement space and provide important industry diversification into discrete markets. NI's leading portfolio of technology and software are well positioned to capitalize on secular trends within semiconductor and electric vehicles, and we expect the transaction to be accretive to our long-term underlying growth. Inclusive of $165 million of synergies by the end of year five, that transaction meets the financial criteria we have communicated. We will work to complete the customary regulatory and closing conditions and expect to close in the first half of Emerson's fiscal 2024. We had the opportunity to meet the extended management team and to do a global town hall with NI employees last week while visiting Austin. From that meeting, we came away even more confident in the potential opportunities of our combined company. The technology is differentiated and has ample room to expand and the talent \u2013 well, it's simply exceptional. But most importantly, I was energized by the warm reception we received from the leadership team and all the employees we met. In a way, I am proud to be an NI-er now as well. Please turn to slide 6. The past 26 months have been fast paced and an exciting journey for Emerson. We moved from a $17 billion two platform business to a cohesive $16 billion automation leader. It took a lot of hard work to transform this business, and we now have an outstanding opportunity to create value for shareholders. It is a portfolio that is exposed to secular growth trends that are expected to drive growth for years to come and we'll remain committed to our 47% through-the-cycle underlying growth target. Our new portfolio is higher margin at approximately 49% gross profit and 23% adjusted segment EBITDA margin.  Our industry mix is more diversified than two years ago, focused on automation and with the discrete markets now our second largest customer end market. While we will continue to pursue bolt-on acquisitions, we're now turning our focus to executing the strategy we laid out at investor conference in delivering the synergies we have committed to for AspenTech and NI. Please turn to slide 7. Emerson and our board are committed to ongoing board refreshments, and yesterday, we had the privilege of announcing two new board members to our board of directors. Leticia Gon\u00e7alves is the President of Global Foods for ADM, and a member of the company's Executive Council. As part of ADM, Bayer and Monsanto, Leticia has held roles in digital solutions, commercial operations, international management, and technology development, and is a longtime advocate and driver of diversity and inclusion. Her experience in these areas and accelerating change make her an excellent addition to our board. Leticia is originally from Brazil. She's a chemical engineer, and has a tremendous passion for innovation.  Speaking of innovation, Jim McKelvey is a successful entrepreneur who founded Block, Invisibly and Fintop Capital. He brings a unique, innovation-focused perspective to Emerson, and will serve as a key collaborator as we continue to accelerate innovation and invest in technology and engineering. Jim has expertise in many areas, including software, cloud and cybersecurity, which will benefit Emerson as we provide customers with leading digital solutions. They are energized and so are we, and we are excited to have both Leticia and Jim join our board of directors. Before I turn the call over to Frank, please turn to slide 8. I would like to congratulate Frank for a distinguished career of over 32 years at Emerson and the past 14 years as CFO. Frank, I met you 28 years ago, and it has been an honor to be your colleague. Please know that you created a legacy here at Emerson. We could not have accomplished what we did over the past 26 months without you. And I would not have been able to lead this company without your wisdom, confidence and support. You made us better. You made me better. Thank you for the lasting impression you left on me and the impact you made on all of us. I'm also excited to announce Mike Baughman as CFO of Emerson, effective May 10. Mike has over 35 years of experience in finance, operations across Baxter, Emerson, of course, and PwC. I'm excited about what Mike brings to the role. And please join me in welcoming him. Mike, congratulations. Michael Baughman : Thanks, Lal. And thanks to you and the board for giving me the opportunity to serve as Emerson's next chief financial officer. I'm very excited to get into the role.  Good morning, everyone. I've had the opportunity to meet several of our investors and analysts, and I'm looking forward to meeting more of you and working with you in the future. And to my Emerson colleagues listening in, thank you for a fantastic quarter.  As Lal just talked about, it's been a productive 26 months with respect to reshaping our portfolio and we're on track to achieve what we set out to do. The impressive result is a more cohesive $16 billion automation company expected to grow 4% to 7% through the cycle, with peer-leading margins and a more diversified end market exposure. I think of the portfolio transformation as a great start. And now we get to operate in this new environment. Execution has always been a hallmark of Emerson. And we're building on that to focus on accelerating profitable growth, integrating NI, and growing our cash flows as the supply chain normalizes. I certainly expect successful execution in these areas to result in increased shareholder value. While I'm excited about our future, transitioning to the CFO role is a little bittersweet for me personally. Frank was a major reason I joined Emerson a little over five years ago. And during that time, I've come to know Frank as a great finance professional, and more importantly, a wonderful person. I'm confident we'll have a smooth transition over the coming months. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Mike. And now, I'll turn the call over to Frank. Frank Dellaquila : Mike, thank you so much for the kind words. When I showed up here 32 years ago, I never \u2013 didn't really know what to expect and I never could have imagined the opportunities that I would have, the things I would get to do, and above all, the people I would have the privilege to work with. The last 13 years have truly been a privilege, leading a world class finance organization, who I respect, I trust implicitly, never let me down. And I thank them from the bottom of my heart. The last two years working with Lal and Ram and the people in this room and our extended team on the portfolio transformation have been truly special, and just a wonderful capstone to my career. And I will always be grateful for that opportunity. Thank you, Lal. I'm truly grateful for that. It's been a heck of a run. Emerson is well positioned for the future. This is a perfect time to turn it over to Mike who I've come to know well as a person, respect as a leader over the last five years. I am confident he's going to provide the right leadership for the challenges we have again. The future is very, very bright, and I'm so happy to have been a small part of it.  I've enjoyed working with all of you over the last two years on the phone with our analysts and our investors, and I couldn't think of a better way to go out and I'm very grateful and I just am so thankful for that.  Thanks everybody. And there is no crying on earnings calls. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Frank. And to you on chart 9. Frank Dellaquila : Okay. Here we go. Good morning again, everyone. Please turn to slide 9. Our second quarter financial results were outstanding, reflecting our strong end markets and operating execution. Lal summarized the results for you, so I'll provide a bit more color. Additional details are in the press release and in the slides and in the appendix to this presentation. Underlying sales growth exceeded our expectations at 14%. All world areas in both business groups were up double digits, reflecting the strength in our end markets, our positioning in them and our geographic presence.  Demand was broad based, with later cycle process markets up high teens and hybrid markets also up double digits in the quarter. Discrete demand has begun to moderate after several quarters of strong growth, but sales were still strong in the quarter, up high-single digits.  Safety and productivity returned to growth, up 3% in the quarter. Net sales also up 14% for the quarter, with a 3 point drag from currency which was essentially offset by acquisitions and divestitures. We did close our Russia divestiture in March and we now report the business we had on the divestiture line of our net sales bridge. Our businesses continue to realize significant price. In the quarter, price contributed approximately $150 million and 5 points of growth. Backlog also grew $300 million, reflecting the strong orders backlog of approximately $6.9 billion to end the quarter. AspenTech revenue was below expectations for reasons they explained on their call and I'll briefly summarize those here. Please keep in mind that AspenTech reports revenue under ASC 606. So the factors affecting GAAP revenue are complex, as explained on AspenTech's earnings call. There were three factors in play. The first was longer-than-planned project execution in the OSI business, which pushed out the recognition of project revenue milestones. This is mainly a timing-related dynamic, and we continue to see strong demand trends from the power transmission and distribution market. AspenTech also experienced shorter term contract lengths within the SSE business. Overall, the shift from perpetual to term contracts is progressing well, but some customers are choosing shorter contract lengths than we expected, and that has a direct impact on upfront revenue recognition.  And lastly, AspenTech is seeing some weakness in OpEx then in the bulk chemical market, which is impacting heritage AspenTech. For further clarification, Emerson's chemical exposure is more diversified across both bulk and specialty chemical and both OpEx and CapEx spend. Adjusted segment EBITA margin improved 320 basis points. Leverage excluding AspenTech exceeded 50%. Strong sales growth, favorable business and world area mix and margin accretive price cost all reflect exceptional execution by operations and contributed to the margin improvement Adjusted EPS grew 25% to $1.09, and we'll discuss that on the next chart. Lastly, free cash flow was up 64% versus the prior year quarter and up 23% year-to-date. The strong earnings growth and slight improvement in working capital contributed to that growth. AspenTech contributed $129 million to free cash flow. Please turn to slide 10. Most importantly, 14% underlying sales growth and 53% segment level operating leverage contributed 26% of our EPS growth quarter-over-quarter. Of that, AspenTech contributed $0.04. Currency was a $0.03 headwind and other items, mainly income tax because we had favorable discrete items last year, were a net $0.05 headwind. The reduced share count, resulting from the $2 billion share repurchase that we completed in the first quarter, contributed $0.04 to earnings per share. So again, overall adjusted EPS grew 25% year-over-year. Please turn to slide 11, and we'll talk about our revised 2023 market outlook. We continue to see broad-based strength in most key end markets. In particular, we've updated our expectations for both process and hybrid markets. We have increased our expectation for process sales to a high-single digit to low-double digit growth range on the back of continued energy, energy transition and chemical market momentum. This market was strong in the second quarter and our customers continued to signal favorable spending plans for the rest of the year. Within chemicals, we continue to see strong CapEx spending, particularly in the US, the Middle East and Asia. Within the hybrid space, life sciences and metals and mining continued to be strong. And we expect this market to grow high-single digits in 2023. Reshoring continues to be a prevalent topic among our customers and we expect near and longer term benefits from this trend. As I mentioned, discrete demand is beginning to moderate as these earlier cycle markets have been strong for the last few years. We are seeing this first in Europe as industrial production is affected by rising input costs. Still, we continue to hear optimism about spend on factory automation and productivity improvements from our customers. Please turn to slide 10 and we'll talk about our revised guidance. Based on the market strengths I described and our continued expectation of mid-single digit orders growth, we are increasing our sales and earnings guidance for the year. For 2023, underlying sales growth has been increased to 8.5% to 10% year-on-year and net sales to 9% to 10.5%. We expect Intelligent Devices to be near the top of this range and Software Control nearer to the lower end. We are also increasing our expectation for segment operating leverage based on the strong first half achievement and our second half outlook. Continued sales strength, favorable price cost and continued operational performance give us confidence in increasing this guide. We now expect segment operating leverage to be in the low to mid 40% range excluding AspenTech. Adjusted EPS guidance has been raised to a range of $4.15 to $4.25, up to $0.15 at the bottom of the range and $0.12 at the midpoint. AspenTech is expected to contribute approximately $0.25 to this improved guidance. The strength in core Emerson operations is more than offsetting the reduced AspenTech expectation, which is incorporated into our guidance. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion for the year, of which AspenTech contributes approximately $300 million. This is consistent with our prior guidance of approximately 100% free cash flow conversion on GAAP net earnings and is equivalent to approximately 85% on an adjusted net earnings basis. In the future, we will express free cash flow conversion on an adjusted net earnings basis, consistent with our other key non-GAAP metrics, adjusted EBITA and adjusted earnings per share. The business we have today has strong cash conversion characteristics that we expect to convert over time at an average of 100% on an adjusted basis. We now expect AspenTech adjusted segment EBITA to be slightly below 40% for the year. As a reminder, Emerson's third quarter is AspenTech's seasonally strongest quarter due to the timing of contract renewals. We believe the operating items that affected AspenTech's third quarter results reflects transitory operating and market challenges. We are as confident as ever, about the long term strategic opportunity afforded by our ownership of AspenTech and in the $110 million year five synergy commitment that we made. As a reminder, all of this guidance excludes the impact of Climate Technologies operations, interest income, and the financial impact of the sale, which we expect to close, we hope, May 31. In the appendix, we have provided information on the post-closing financial reporting treatment of Climate Technologies.  Briefly, to turn to the third quarter, that guide also reflects the strong outlook for the year. We expect underlying sales growth of 10% to 12%. We expect leverage to be in the mid to high 40s in the quarter, and adjusted EPS to be between $1.07 and $1.11. This represents an 18% increase at the midpoint versus prior year. We should point out, for context, that last year's third quarter was negatively impacted by China shutdowns and serious supply chain challenges around electronics, which at the time, we estimated reduced third quarter sales by approximately $150 million, with the China impact being pushed into the fourth quarter. Thank you for your attention. I'll turn it back now to the operator to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And this morning's first question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : I guess my first question is a lot of debate with investors about the impact of improving lead times on orders, backlog, and free cash flows. Clearly, you're starting releasing working capital. But if you're releasing working capital, perhaps you're ordering less stuff. And if you're ordering less stuff, maybe somebody else is ordering less stuff. How do you think this dynamic will play out over the next 6 to 12 months? Lal Karsanbhai : Well, I'll start off with some comments just on the underlying environment, which we're still optimistic about, as you heard on the call, Andrew. Mid-single digit order run rates, we came out of the quarter at 7%, and expect that that range to continue through the remainder of the year. So the demand environment based on our see is strong. And as Frank outlined correctly, and there's some puts and takes out there, and we're watching those carefully, but as a whole, we feel very good about that. Having said that, we have a very robust backlog as well. We did build backlog in the quarter, and we continue to work through that which gives me further confidence, obviously, in the performance of the company for the second half. Naturally, with supply chain challenges largely alleviated, of course, there's still a few issues out there, but largely alleviated. Lead times have started to come down. But we haven't seen that reflected in any slow in orders. And very much, as you saw quarter-over-quarter and sequentially, our order pace continued to be very consistent.  Ram, anything to add? Ram Krishnan : I would say again, Andrew, I think from a lead time perspective, distribution, for example, is less than 20% of our overall sales. So, we can \u2013 frankly, even with distributors, as our lead times have come down, we haven't seen any change in ordering patterns.  Our KOB3 business, which is the other piece that is lead time dependent, continues to be strong. So no fundamental change for us as it relates to ordering patterns from our customers, as lead times across all categories of products for us have come down. Now, I know others have mentioned that. But to date, we haven't seen the impact. Andrew Obin : Just maybe a follow-up question on aligning Aspen and Emerson sales channel. You guys clearly highlighted Golden Triangle's success of going to market together, you've affirmed the synergies. But I guess the question I have, as you work closer with Aspen, one of the opportunities to improve visibility at Emerson because you have access now to a lot of CIOs, but also what are the opportunities at Aspen to benefit from deep and broad relationships that Emerson has? Was there key clients, for example, in the chemical space, right? You said our relationships are much broader. What can you do to improve visibility at Aspen in key verticals? Lal Karsanbhai : It's a great question. And it goes back to the heart of the very robust commercial agreement that we have with AspenTech. There is world area alignment in leadership, there is sales force alignment and incentives, and very honestly joined pursuit in two areas, capital projects, which was the example that I shared with you and then a very robust analysis on an industry by industry basis of the whitespace opportunities that exist, particularly for our control system and for AspenTech. And that's more of a systematic approach by the selling organizations, but one that will prove to be \u2013 and is proving to be quite a large opportunity as well. Ram? Ram Krishnan : Just to add, I think the customer landscape is really the way we really want to drive more seat for AspenTech. Certainly, the momentum on projects is there early. But as we shared with you before, 70% of the control systems that we have, DeltaV innovation, don't have level three software capability at many of our customers. 9,000 of those are in markets like life sciences and metals and mining. So those are the unique type of opportunities, the AMS systems that we have where we can bring Aspen, that's the approach we're taking through our commercial agreement.  We are very, very geographically focused as well, where we look at markets where Aspen doesn't have the strength, and that's really where a lot of the effort is being put. So we'll see that benefit come through. It's three quarters in, obviously, in the relationship. The momentum is early on projects, but more will come as it relates to the whitespace that I described over time. Operator : And the next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : My first question is maybe take us through what you're seeing on the discrete side with some of the demand moderating? How did it progress through the quarter? Is it isolated to some specific verticals or geographies? Because we are hearing elsewhere slowing in Europe, especially on the chemical side, but appreciate the color there, please. Ram Krishnan : Deane, Ram here. From a discrete order activity \u2013 now the discrete business from a sales perspective, we had good strong growth in the quarter, 9.5%, close to 10% growth in the quarter from a sales perspective, which was driven by backlog reduction. Orders did go slightly negative this quarter, primarily driven by slowdown in Europe. Frankly, we haven't seen much of a slowdown in North America, but a slight slowdown in Europe, particularly in Germany and the segment around machine builders. We do serve the machine builder segment in Germany, which is both domestic German market as well as these machine builders export. So that's really probably the one segment, a little bit of slowdown in the UK. Frankly, Asia is holding up, and China remains good. So that's the color. We do expect discrete to get into tougher comparisons as we get through the second half of the year, and we expect orders to remain negative before they turn positive into 2024. Deane Dray : Just a follow up. And also, I just want to hear Frank one more time here. Free cash flow difference between GAAP and adjusted this year, that difference, how much of that is either working capital needs given kind of supply chain? Or is it more from climate? Frank Dellaquila : No, none of these differences \u2013 the difference is simply the calculation, the denominator. Deane, we're just talking about the $2.2 billion guide of free cash flow and whether we use GAAP earnings or we use adjusted earnings as the denominator and that's the difference between the conversion ratio, there's no difference at all in the calculation of the cash flow itself. Operator : And the next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : I don't want to fixate on AspenTech, we can do that later, perhaps, but I will anyways. The bulk chemical OpEx, is it typically that? Volatile? Is it something that they've experienced in the past and perhaps you might see in the future? Or is this a kind of an unusual circumstance? Ram Krishnan : No, I think the bulk chemical dynamic because you see many of the chemical customers say, at the end of the day, with a little bit of slowing demand there and the utilization rates being optimized, but the portion of the AspenTech business which typically gets impacted is their manufacturing and supply chain software suite.  So in terms of new purchases or new contracts around that, which we have built into the forecast, that's where we're seeing slowdown. So that's pretty normal. Obviously, refining for them continues to remain strong, upstream and midstream continues to remain good. It's really the manufacturing and supply chain suite in bulk chemicals where we have seen the slowdown, and we've seen that in the past when the large chemical customers slow down spending on the OpEx side. Scott Davis : Guys, it's assuming your stock price works and I know AspenTech is down quite a bit from its highs, but is there any interest in \u2013 I know there's some restrictions, but those things can always be discussed in taking an even larger stake in the entity and perhaps, over time, integrating it fully into Emerson. Lal Karsanbhai : No, look, we're still very committed to the model that we set forward a year \u2013 closed it nearly a year ago now. It works. We're seeing the commercial value. We're working the technology piece as well. And like I've said in the past, it's at a point in time that changes and we have impetus to then address that through the change in the ownership structure of the vehicle. We'll think about it then, but not at this point. And then furthermore, as you know, and you noted, we are in a standstill period for another calendar year from now. Operator : And the next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Lal, could you give us a little more color into your incremental margin performance both for Q2 and 2023? I know the new Emerson is supposed to record higher incrementals well in the 30s, but what's changed for Emerson in 2022 that's allowing you to record low to mid 40s, over 50% in Q2, is it mostly the 5% price that Frank mentioned and much improved supply chain environment? Is maybe underlying Emerson able to sustain incrementals in the 40% plus excess over the longer term and how you're thinking about price versus cost moving forward? Lal Karsanbhai : I'll let Ram add some operating color. As we went through the quarter, we certainly believe in the strong guide that we put together on the 40 leverage for the full year given the early performance in the first six months. Look, there were a lot of things that were positive. Obviously, the execution was exceptional. I think the operating executives in the businesses performed very, very well and exact. The volume was important, as we noted, growing the underlying sales at 14%. But furthermore, mix and price cost were beneficial as well in the quarter.  So a lot of things went our way there. But honestly, working within the management system that we've designed is a very important parameter that enables our businesses to perform at a very high level. Ram? Ram Krishnan : Other dynamics that certainly went our way is strong North America in the quarter, strong performance in our instrumentation and final control businesses and the leverage we got there. So dynamics are on mix, certainly the price-cost element that Lal mentioned, but, fundamentally, the 14% sales growth in the quarter does help leverage. So all of those dynamics went in our favor. Andy Kaplowitz : Maybe you can give us a little more color into what you're seeing by region. I think China was relatively weak for you in Q1. It seems like it's better in Q2. I think, Lal, you mentioned easy comparisons in Q3. So how do you think about regional demand moving forward for the rest of the year. Lal Karsanbhai : Really good. It was a very robust quarter globally for us in terms of sales performance, and very honestly orders, as Frank outlined. China flipped for us. It was down in the mid-single digits a quarter goes. It's up high single digits, and in sales in the mid-single digits. So we feel very good. And we feel good about what we see in China for the remainder of the year as well. So that's a positive.  Look, North America, very robust growth, broad strength, a lot of it driven by the nearshoring elements and core strength in hybrid and processed, with growth of 15-ish percent in sales. Europe, that's been very honestly, Andy, the biggest surprise of the year. It continues to be very strong for us with growth in the mid-teens, 14% in the quarter in sales, and orders that are very strong. And very honestly, highlighted by energy, sustainability and life science investments.  And then the rest of Asia, driven by India, Southeast Asia, and then an incredibly strong Middle East and Africa region as well, with significant investments in sustainability and LNG across the region. So at this point in time, with the exception of the discrete weaknesses that we've already talked through, continue to see very strong global momentum as we go through the quarter here into the rest of the year. Operator : And the next question comes from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Steve Tusa : What was price capture in the quarter? And what do you expect it to be for the year? Frank Dellaquila : It was 5 points in the quarter and we expect to be 3% to 4% for the year. Steve Tusa : Lal, I'm just curious from a governance perspective, the Aspen results, there's a lot going on there. I guess, I get a high level, some of it sounds like execution on some of these contracts. Perhaps in the, I guess, I call it, the integration phase of what they're doing, even though it's not really an acquisition by them, I guess, it seems like that there were a couple things that surprised them about the assets that you guys are contributing. How does that conversation work in the boardroom there because those are like assets that you guys knew. I'm not sure how surprising that was to you. But it was clearly surprising to the market the way this has played out. So, I'm just curious. Like, a little more color from your perspective on the integration that's going on there and perhaps how that kind of discussion and how to move forward plays out when that type of thing happens. Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah, no. Absolutely, Steve. I'll give you some color here. Maybe there's three or four here critical points. Let me first begin by saying that I continue to be and we collectively continue to be very optimistic about the business and the differentiation that it provides as a technology solution across a diverse customer base. That's very important.  Secondly, the execution of both the commercial and the technology synergies is progressing ahead of pace. We have alignment across our selling organizations, the technology teams, and I highlighted a capital project that we worked on and we're working on many across the world, and we have a joint funnel of pursuits.  So what happened in the Q? And I think they're important dimensions here to talk about. The first, the company continues to perform extremely strongly. It's a rule of 50 software business, with ACV growth exceeding 11% and strong cash flow. But there were three challenges in the quarter. And these are challenges that we have a robust communication process, not just at the board level, but at an operating level. And we speak with Antonio and Chantelle who's the CFO on a regular basis. The first is shorter term contracts on subscriptions at SSE, which obviously was one of the one of the assets that we contributed to. The assumption in the plan was on a three to four year basis of subscriptions, that was we converted \u2013 AspenTech converted those from perpetual license to subscription. The reality is that they came in more in the one year level. So that had an impact on revenue recognition, just the nature of that conversion journey and as those customers in that market space accept subscription contracts over the perpetual traditional licenses.  The second, you also referenced is OSI. It is a differentiated business in a high growth segments, as you know, but the integration has been slower. It's a business that came with a heavy service component to it. And very honestly, that migration and conversion, ultimately, from perp to sub on the software is taking longer than expected. But we continue to be jointly very optimistic about the business. The orders in the business are strong. And we will work through the next few quarters to execute there.  And then lastly, as Ram described earlier, the heritage AspenTech business in the slowdown related to the bulk chemical segment there.  But having said all of that, look, the plan has been reset. It's embedded in our results here. It's embedded in the outlook that we provided in the guide. And the investment is \u2013 I still believe there's a tremendous amount of value creation opportunity here for Emerson shareholders. And we continue to be very committed. And I think we have the processes, both operating which is CEO to CEO, CFOs and through the Emerson management process as best we can here and through the board of directors in which to manage and to be part of the conversations and discussions with that team. Steve Tusa : Are you assuming a bounce back in your fourth quarter in those results? Lal Karsanbhai : Of course. No, look, I think we've embedded their perspective, which they shared with their investors on their call into our guide. Operator : The next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Maybe just picking up off Steve's question there. Maybe this is a question to you, Frank. Maybe just talk about some of the moving pieces in the guide. Clearly, the bulk of the uplift is driven by much better revenue conversion, margin conversion, but maybe some of the moving pieces. AspenTech, how's that changed in the guide? Maybe stock comp. Any of the sort of major discrete lumps would be helpful. Frank Dellaquila : The main driver is obviously the improved outlook for operations. The uplift in the sales as well as the operational execution with strong price realization, all the things that drove the strong leverage in the second quarter, we expect to have in the third quarter and throughout the rest of the year. So, that is mainly the story. And that is strong enough to overcome the reduced AspenTech guide. As Lal said, we essentially incorporate their guide into our numbers. And they took the guide down for the year. So we've overcome that headwind as we move from the February to the current guidance and those are those are the main pieces. Nigel Coe : And that's what, $0.06, $0.07, mark-to-market on AspenTech? Frank Dellaquila : For the year roughly, yeah, in that range. Nigel Coe : Maybe picking up off Ram's comment on the sort of installed base of DCS. You said 70% don't have level three software capability. Does that precipitate in an upgrade cycle? I know we've talked about upgrade cycles in the past, but are we at the threshold now where we might see an install base upgrade cycle? Was it more just patching around that with some of the capabilities around software? Ram Krishnan : I don't know if we're planning for a major upgrade wave. But I think it's more a disciplined approach with each one of our customers to address the optimization benefits and the APM benefits and some of the capabilities that Aspen brings to improve the performance of the overall automation system that is installed in many of these customers. And we're going across the board, across industries, power and life sciences being the focus area. Everybody is very interested in digitally transforming their assets. And we're seeing more and more interest from our customers to launch digital transformation programs across the automation stack where level three software has an important role to play, primarily around optimization on the manufacturing suite, and then more the asset performance management and the reliability software on uptime of assets in their infrastructure. So that's the journey. I think you're going to see more and more of that.  Sustainability is another area where software gets deployed. But I don't think it's a big wave. I think it's more a disciplined wave over time, and we have the opportunity to drive it. Operator : And the next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : A lot of ground covered. I just wanted to touch back on capital deployment. And Lal has just said the big moves are done and that certainly makes sense. But you did indicate that you're working bolt-ons and it looks like you also maybe have a six month gap or so between the Climate proceeds and National Instruments closing. Just wonder how that might play out over that timeframe? Is there room for some more share repurchase? Are there actionable bolt-ons that could be happening kind of over the summer period? Or just what we should expect there? Lal Karsanbhai : I'll let Frank comment as well here. But, no, look, we obviously work towards the closing of National Instruments over those six months aggressively. It may come sooner. We'll see. Depends on the regulatory approvals. That's going to be the key pacing items, as you know, Jeff. The bolt-ons, we work them aggressively within the businesses. And some are competitive processes, others not. And we have two or three of those that we're looking at at any given point in time. It will continue to do so. These are sub billion dollar purchase price type of deals, and we have a small number we're looking at right now and evaluating.  Look, we will continue to be very committed to return cash to our shareholders, whether that's through the dividends or share repurchase. And as we go into 2024, we'll lay out what the appropriate plan there is, and communicate that. Frank, anything to add? Frank Dellaquila : Jeff, I wouldn't view share repurchase decisions in the context of kind of the gaps between closing Climate and closing NI. I would view it more broadly as part of the capital allocation strategy. After we close NI, we'll have a balance sheet that's well below 2 debt to EBITDA and a tremendous amount of financial flexibility. So we'll just continue to make those decisions in that context. Jeff Sprague : Just back to chem and I do understand you have a more diverse business than Aspen, but why shouldn't we kind of view this as an early warning sign of pressure in the core business in chem. And maybe just a little bit more color what you're seeing there because there are. obviously, CapEx and profitability issues kind of across a lot of that industry right now. Ram Krishnan : For us, the capital cycle in chemical, particularly specialty chemical, is as good as we have seen it, particularly in Middle East, Asia Pacific and ethylene and methanol investments in North America. So, for us, we haven't seen the capital cycle slow. However, what Aspen is referencing is the OpEx spend in chemical customers as they throttle their production in response to slowing demand, and therefore that translates to MSC purchases, the manufacturing supply chain suite purchases, is really the dynamic that's impacting them. It's a small impact to them at this point, but given it's 18% of their sales mix, I think they've referenced that.  But to be honest, we haven't really seen any KOB3 slowdown or KOB2 in chemical. And then certainly many of our major project wins to date that we have been sharing with you have been in the chemical/petrochemical space, particularly in the emerging markets. So at this point, we don't see that as an inflection point or a slowdown in the industry, despite the higher feedstock costs. Operator : The next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Joe O'Dea: I wonder just on the discrete, if you could elaborate a little bit on North America and the interplay between some of the structural and it sounds like continued strength that you're seeing in sort of battery electric and semiconductors. But then the flip side of that, anything that you're just seeing from sort of a general industrial cyclical standpoint, whether the macro uncertainty is having any impact or whether it's more just kind of natural digestion of what's been ordered over the last few years? Ram Krishnan : In North America, to be honest, on the discrete side, we haven't seen \u2013 we obviously don't play in a big way in semiconductors and batteries yet. We play in a smaller fashion with our DeltaV business. But obviously, we'll get a lot more exposure to that dynamic with National Instruments. In the core machine automation business that we play in North America, we haven't seen a significant slowdown to date, but it is obviously slower than the momentum we're seeing in the process markets. Joe O'Dea: Also, just wanted to ask about Natty and integration planning and sort of what efforts are currently underway that you're standing up, say, over the next six months to ensure a successful launch of the integration process there. Lal Karsanbhai : This is Lal. We kicked that off last week in Austin over a day and a half with the management team. We've assembled a team with steering committee. And then we have functional integration leadership across the eight value drivers or so that have been identified. Obviously, on the steering committee basis, I participate as does Eric Starkoff and we've each named a leader on the integration team. In our case, Vincent Cervello [ph]. So that's off and running. Meetings are taking place. We will have a in-person kickoff with a large group here in St. Louis coming up, and then we'll be off and running on all the full integrations. But really good start. Great organizational discussions already have taken place. And now we are excited about this work ahead of us as we head to close. Operator : Thank you. This concludes both the question-and-answer session as well as the event itself. Thank you so much for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Please note that this event is being recorded. Now I'd like to turn the conference over to Colleen Mettler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Colleen Mettler : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Emerson's third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings conference call. Today, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; Chief Financial Officer, Mike Baughman and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Please join me on Slide two. This presentation may include forward-looking statements, which contain a degree of business risks and uncertainty. Please take time to read the safe harbor statement and note on non-GAAP measures. I will now pass the call over to Emerson President and CEO, Lal Karsanbhai, for his opening remarks. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Colleen, and good morning. This quarter's results are a testament to the tremendous people of Emerson. I am humbled by what you do every day. Thank you for the passion and energy and the effort you bring to our great company every single day. Two and a half years ago when I became CEO, we expressed our vision for accelerated value creation, culture, portfolio and execution. I am proud today more than ever before of the progress we have made. The Emerson management system has empowered our leaders and open the world of possibilities for our company in the field of innovation and commercial excellence with a higher growth, more cohesive portfolio. But above all, the Emerson management system is the tool that enables our team to continue to deliver differentiated financial results. The work never ends, but I am proud of how far we have journeyed and a clear road ahead. Please turn to Slide three. Q3 was an exceptional quarter, and our teams continue to perform well and deliver for our shareholders. We made tremendous progress on our strategic priorities, closing the climate -- the Copeland transaction, launching new-to-the-world products and winning several key projects in our organic growth platforms; energy transition, industrial software and priority discrete and hybrid markets. We have once again increased our expectations for the year based on our continued operational execution. We now expect double-digit underlying sales growth, approximately 50% operating leverage and over 20% adjusted EPS growth for 2023, top quartile performance. As we look ahead, we are energized by our value creation opportunities. Emerson is and will continue to benefit from our significant exposure to secular growth trends like energy affordability and security, sustainability and decarbonization, digital transformation and near-shoring. Over 30% of our sales are directly aligned to these trends, as we discussed at our investor conference in November. Our technology and solutions are highly differentiated in these spaces, positioning our business for growth. We are also innovating for these markets, helping customers solve their toughest challenges with disruptive technology and solutions. Our portfolio transformation is paying off as we have aligned our cohesive portfolio to these secular trends. And our favorable value drivers combined with our Emerson management system, provide the road map for future success at Emerson. Turning to Slide four; this quarter exceeded expectations across the board. Underlying orders were up 3%, led by high single-digit process and hybrid demand growth. We continue to see secular trends driving the demand strength. As an example, LNG projects continue to move forward and customers' energy transition and sustainability budgets are growing, improving resilience, both for greenfield projects in hydrogen, clean fuels and renewables and for brownfield, decarbonization opportunities like emissions reductions and carbon capture. Renewables is a particular area of strength we are winning based on our superior technology and breadth of capabilities, which we'll discuss shortly. Nearshoring is also driving incremental investments around the globe in areas like life sciences and metals and mining. It is still early stages of global stimulus for programs like the United States IRA, chips and IIJA are driving additional conversations with our customers, which we expect to turn to funded projects down the road. Our strong performance in process and hybrid was partially offset by demand in discrete, which continues to slow. Orders were down in Q3 against tougher comparisons for this piece of the business. As we mentioned previously, Europe, especially Germany, continues to slow and we have seen some softening in the U.S. and Asia. Looking at the overall business and given continued robust demand and strong underlying growth drivers, we still expect mid-single-digit full year order growth. The continued demand and improving supply chain environment, which includes improved availability of electronic components, enabled 14% underlying sales growth in the quarter, above our expectations. The Americas and Europe were up 11% and 13%, respectively, while Asia, Middle East and Africa were up 20%, strong performance of last year's impact of the Shanghai COVID shutdowns. Intelligent Devices and software and control were both up double digits. It is clear when we speak to customers and compete for projects that our technology is winning in the marketplace. We are proud of what we have built and confident this will continue. Software and control growth of 19% is a testament to our leading control systems, DeltaV innovation, which are well positioned where our customers are spending, areas like life sciences, metals and mining, hydrogen, clean fuels and renewables. Within the quarter, we won large projects in life sciences, metals and mining, including lithium and LNG. Intelligent Devices grew 13%. Final Control and measurement and analytical are the de facto standards for traditional energy, transition energy, chemical and power markets across the globe. This later cycle exposure and the business's continued technology leadership in areas like control valves, actuators, regulators, pressure, temperature, flow level and wireless; our differentiators for Emerson and are leading to strong financial returns. This strong sales performance and the continued operational execution of our teams led to 59% operating leverage in the quarter, excluding AspenTech. Favorable impacts from price cost and mix also drove accretive margin performance. Adjusted EPS was $1.29, beating our guidance, again driven by the strong sales and operational performance. Free cash flow was up 83% year-over-year and is up 47% year-to-date. Please turn to Slide 5. We continue to accelerate progress on our strategic priorities. On May 31, we closed the Copeland transaction. Emerson received $9.7 billion in upfront cash or approximately $8 billion after tax for the transaction. We also have the future proceeds from the $2.25 billion Copeland note receivable and our 40% common equity ownership with a transaction value of $1.7 billion. Post closing, Emerson has a net cash position and taking into consideration the NI acquisition, Emerson expects to have a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than two. I also want to provide a quick update on our corporate and platform rightsizing activities we announced at the beginning of the year. As planned, we did not have any stranded costs due to the Copeland sale and are well on track to achieve our $100 million annualized cost savings by 2024. We also released our ESG report in June, highlighting a 42% reduction in greenhouse gas emission intensity from our 2018 baseline. This achievement surpasses our 20% target six years ahead of schedule. In the report, we also highlight numerous examples of how Emerson is helping customers navigate the energy transition and the application of our technology to reducing emissions and energy usage. Lastly, before moving on to some exciting innovation and customer wins, I wanted to provide a quick update on the NI acquisition. We remain on track to close the acquisition in the first half of our fiscal 2024, and the teams are actively working on integration planning as we're prepared to be ready for day 1. In late June, NI shareholders voted in favor of our acquisition. HSR was once again approved and all necessary regulatory filings have been made. And I released their earnings last week with another record sales quarter, up 5% year-on-year and strong margin performance. They, too, are seeing supply chain constraints easy, which helped drive their sales performance by converting backlog despite the negative orders environment, which was down 17%. The demand environment for the business is playing out largely as we expected with discrete and semiconductor weakness expected to improve as the calendar year goes on. Please turn to Slide 6. As the rate of our customer sustainability and digital investments continue to accelerate, Emerson is ensuring that we are positioned to capture this spend. Part of this is through our strong dedication to innovation, and new-to-the-world products. Recently, Emerson has had numerous impactful innovations. First, ASPEN 1-V14 is the next step in helping customers on the sustainability journey. Not only does V14 offer more than 100 sustainability-specific models, it also provides solutions to help customers manage emissions and design new hydrogen processes. V14 also further incorporates artificial intelligence, which, when combined with first principle models, helps users reach optimal production, increasing profitability while reducing emissions. Emerson also recently launched enhancements to our AMS device management software platform, now aligned for more seamless integration with AspenTech solutions like Mtell. This allows users to have more access to critical intelligent device data for use in advanced analytics and models. This example shows the differentiation of the Emerson plus AspenTech portfolio and technology synergy opportunities together. Emerson has long been a trusted partner of utilities around the globe, as evidenced by the fact that Ovation controls approximately 50% of the electricity generated in the United States. This leadership uniquely positions Emerson to support our customers' transition to renewables. And we are doing so through our new integrated renewable energy control solution, Ovation Green. Ovation Green allows customers to manage their renewables assets like solar, wind, hydro and hydrogen, all in one platform, and we are already seeing early success with some of the largest utilities in the United States. Lastly, our measurement and analytical business recently launched a new-to-the-world noncontacting radar device that is ideally suited for a range of applications in chemical, life sciences and food and beverage. With advanced capabilities like Bluetooth and a built-in historian to store process data and insights, the transmitter is optimized for ease-of-use and simplicity. This device incorporates RADAR technology, a fast-growing technology in the measurement space. As we look at continued growth in our measurement business, this innovation will serve as a foundation to building LEVEL as the next technology pillar, accompanying our leadership in pressure, temperature and flow. As one of our key drivers -- growth drivers, Emerson is committed to accelerating innovation and meeting the rapidly evolving needs of our customers, like the ones highlighted here. Turning to Slide 7. At our November investor conference, we outlined our through-the-cycle growth strategy, which includes our strategic focus on organic growth platforms. These markets, including life sciences, metals and mining, factory automation, industrial software and energy transition are areas closely aligned to the secular growth trends that are driving incremental customer investment. This is demonstrated in the evolution of our funnel over the past nine months. Not only have we successfully expanded our funnel to $9.7 billion, over this time frame, up from $7.1 billion, but nearly all of this growth can be attributed to our growth markets, namely energy transition, life sciences and metals and mining. Our energy transition funnel is now nearly $5 billion, up from $3.5 billion in November. This expanded funnel is driven by new project announcements in hydrogen, clean fuels, carbon capture and EV batteries, all where we are actively engaged in our technologies well suited. We have also continued to expand our metals and mining and life science funnel, and we are now capturing additional strategic projects in our funnel as we dedicate more time and resources towards pursuing these engagements. In the third quarter alone, we added over 300 projects to the funnel and were awarded a content in over 50. This indicates a solid pace of project announcements as near-shoring and sustainability trends spread globally. We expect these organic growth platforms will grow double digits through the cycle, and we are off to an excellent start in 2023. Please turn to Slide 8, where we'll highlight a few key wins across these segments, which underscore the power of Emerson's highly differentiated portfolio of solutions and the opportunity ahead for Emerson. The LNG wave continues to progress, and Emerson is winning our share of opportunities. Of the projects that have moved forward over the past two years, Emerson has been awarded content in 7, demonstrating our continued leadership in this space. These are large projects with ample automation opportunity. On average, approximately $10 million of automation opportunity per million ton per annum of liquefaction. Our unmatched portfolio of measurement devices, valves, control systems and now optimization software, differentiates Emerson as the only automation company capable of providing a holistic solution. Emerson's leading project execution is also a key differentiator for these large and complex projects. Through our project certainty approach, Emerson helps customers expedite project time lines and reduce project costs, key measures to reaching profitability faster. One of these seven projects was the Port Arthur LNG project. Emerson is excited to announce it will be supporting Bechtel Energy and Sempra Infrastructure in the automation of the Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 project. This liquefaction and export terminal in Southeast Texas is a premier LNG project designed for safe, reliable and efficient operations, delivering LNG to global markets through two trains capable of producing up to 13.5 million metric tons per annum. Emerson was chosen as a key automation partner for Bechtel Energy, providing our leading DeltaV control system, final control valves and measurement technology. Further, on Slide 9, the next market we'd like to highlight is the battery value chain. This is an area where we are winning projects based on the breadth, depth and strength of Emerson's end-to-end capabilities from the mining of lithium and copper through refining and processing and finally, to EV battery manufacturing, assembly and recycling. In 2022, Emerson technology helped produce over 65% of global electric vehicles. We are excited to continue supporting companies around the world as production expands across each of these high-growth segments. Recently, Emerson was selected to automate two very strategic projects in mining. First, the Ganfeng Lithium project in Argentina. Emerson's DeltaV control system was selected to automate the large-scale lithium mine, a strategic win in the lithium triangle between Argentina, Chile and Bolivia that holds much of the world's lithium reserves. DeltaV was selected because of its differentiated and flexible architecture and commissioning savings with Charms. The next project success was for CODELCO in the Andina copper mine in Chile. CODELCO is the world's largest producer of copper, and Andina site will represent over 10% of CODELCO's overall output. Emerson's DeltaV and control software were selected to help automate the treatment of water on the site, allowing CODELCO to accurately control water quality, efficiency and recycling. Emerson recently won a contract with one of the largest EV manufacturers because of our unique ability to support production across multiple processes in the value chain. With this project, Emerson will be the trusted automation partner to support two facilities : a lithium refining project and cathode production facility in Texas. DeltaV was chosen for both projects due to its robust software architecture and ability to bring together previous islands of automation. As the customer continues to grow operations globally with numerous expansions in new operations, Emerson is well positioned to be the supplier of choice given the unique nature and value of the capabilities that we can deliver. Emerson was also recently awarded a large project with a leading German EV manufacturer to help automate the battery cell assembly process. As we look at future opportunities, NI has a leadership position with many of the largest EV and battery manufacturers in the world. And I've differentiated hardware and software solutions help customers with the R&D, testing and validation of batteries and vehicles, and we look forward to leveraging those relationships to expand our current factory automation business and build upon our recent successes. As you can tell, we are energized by these projects and our relevance with customers. We will share our progress as Emerson continues to partner with leading EV manufacturers around the world and benefit from the strength and differentiation of our portfolio of assets. I'll now turn the call over to Mike Baughman. Michael Baughman : Thanks, Lal, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 11. Our third quarter financial results were outstanding. And before talking about that, I want to thank our global teams for their hard work and execution. Our Emerson management system is driving value as evidenced by our continued sales growth, margin expansion, earnings growth and free cash flow performance. Turning to the results, underlying sales growth exceeded our expectations at 14%. GAAP sales were also up 14% for the quarter and price contributed approximately five points of growth. Backlog of $6.9 billion, remained flat quarter-over-quarter. Software and control performed better than we expected, growing underlying sales 19% due to increased availability of electronic components and our ability to convert more of the backlog in this business. Intelligent Devices grew 13%, led by process and hybrid exposed businesses, mainly measurement and analytical and final control. These two businesses are leaders in later cycle markets and have a large installed base, which, along with the continued backlog conversion, contributed to strong growth in the quarter. From an industry perspective, process and hybrid remained healthy with double-digit growth in the quarter. As Lal mentioned, discrete activity has continued to slow, but still exhibited mid-single-digit sales growth due to backlog conversion. Emerson adjusted segment EBITDA margin improved 370 basis points to 26.9%. Leverage, excluding AspenTech was 59%. Strong sales growth, margin accretive price costs and favorable product and project mix, all reflect the excellent execution by our operations teams and contributed to the margin improvement. Adjusted EPS grew 40% to $1.29, and I will discuss the details of that growth on the next chart. Lastly, free cash flow of $769 million, was up 83% versus the prior year quarter. For the quarter, free cash flow conversion of adjusted earnings was 97%. The strong earnings growth and working capital improvement helped contribute to the free cash flow growth. Please turn to Slide 11 for the details of adjusted EPS and bridge from the prior year. Most importantly, the strong 14% underlying sales growth and 59% segment level operating leverage contributed $0.29 of EPS growth year-over-year. Stock compensation was a $0.06 headwind due to lower stock comp expense in the prior year, but that was more than offset by other corporate items and tax, which were an $0.08 tailwind. The reduced share count resulting from the $2 billion share repurchase completed in the first quarter contributed $0.04 to adjusted EPS. Lastly, now that the copeland transaction has closed, we are including the interest from the Copeland note receivable and adjusted results and guidance moving forward. The Copeland note interest contributed $0.02 to adjusted EPS in the third quarter, and it is important to note this was not included in our May guidance. Overall, adjusted EPS grew 40% year-over-year to $1.29. Turning to Slide 12. And as we look ahead to the rest of the year, I'd like to highlight a few key things. In general, end markets remain resilient. We have increased our expectations for process to double-digit sales growth with meaningful contribution from secular growth segments, energy transition and energy security. With continued strength in life sciences and metals and mining, we now expect hybrid to grow low double digits in 2023. We are discussing nearing initiatives with more and more customers. This is not just a trend in the United States, and we see near and long-term benefits around the globe. For example, our team recently visited Australia and China where we spoke to customers about their plans to make investments in new markets like life sciences. As a global leader for providing automation for this market, these customers are tapping Emerson to support their investments. Discrete demand is continuing to slow, especially in Europe, and we are beginning to see the impacts in the United States and Asia. Sales growth expectations when combined with our Safety and Productivity commercial exposure, are in the low single-digit to mid-single-digit range as we have worked through backlog. The supply chain environment has continued to improve, allowing us to work through our backlog as we head into Q4. Price cost has been a significant tailwind in 2023, a reflection of our commercial excellence. We expect price for the year to approach four points, and we will remain diligent on price as a key performance level. As we look to the future, we are excited by our growth opportunities. Emerson is uniquely positioned to support our customers' investments in key areas we expect to grow double digits through the cycle. We've demonstrated our leadership in energy transition markets like LNG, nuclear, hydrogen, clean fuels, carbon capture and renewables. We are well positioned to capture the long-term investments driven by near shoring. And finally, we have a leading and differentiated software portfolio that is expected to have double-digit ACV growth through the cycle. These are all trends we expect to continue to augment Emerson's growth for the foreseeable future. Please turn to Slide 13. As this chart shows, our performance this year has been exceptional. We have successfully executed on our portfolio transformation while continuing to drive strong results across the business and exceed on our commitments. Strong operational performance, improved price/cost management and more favorable mix as we went through the year gave us the ability to increase our expectations throughout the year. For 2023, underlying sales growth is now expected to be towards the top end of our previous 8.5% to 10% guidance range. We expect both intelligent devices and software and control to be on par with this overall updated guidance. As a reminder, AspenTech will begin rolling into our underlying sales in Q4 and as we lap a year of ownership. We are also increasing our expectation for segment operating leverage based on the strong Q3 result, sales strength, favorable price cost and continued strong operational performance. We now expect segment operating leverage to be approximately 50%, excluding AspenTech. Adjusted EPS has been raised to $4.40 to $4.45 and a 22% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Please note this includes $0.06 of interest from the Copeland note receivable that we are now including in our adjusted results, $0.02 from Q3 and approximately $0.04 in Q4. AspenTech is still expected to contribute approximately $0.25 for the year. Post Copeland transaction closed, please note we have now included an estimate for the Copeland equity loss in our GAAP guidance numbers which, in addition to the undeployed proceeds is being removed from our adjusted results and guidance. We have also adjusted our expected tax rate to approximately 22% for the year. Free cash flow is expected to be $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion for the year, of which AspenTech is on approximately $300 million. Thanks for your attention. I will now turn back to Nick to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question will be from Nigel Coe, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I thought maybe just to set off on the obviously very strong operating performance, but margins were the real standouts. So I'm just wondering, as we go into '24, I mean, is anything we should think about in terms of maybe some headwinds to margins? I'm thinking here, but measurement analytics very strong sequentially up 20%. Are you confident that you can grow off these margins going forward? Michael Baughman : Nigel, yes, we're very excited about the leverage that we've had with 40%, 53% and then 59% in the quarter. You do see that operating leverage tipped down a little bit in the fourth quarter, and we're going to exit the year around 50%. So yes, we feel good about the operating leverage, and we're not really in a position to talk about '24 at this point. But we certainly are pleased with the current year performance. Lal Karsanbhai : And I'll just add a little bit of color. Thanks, Mike. I do believe that the underlying work that we've been doing around price, cost management, thinking about how we bring our differentiated technology to market will be sustainable into -- through the cycle as we talked about. And we look at the leverage targets as we go to '24, and we'll talk about that later in the fall. But I feel very good about the momentum in the business and the executional elements that are going to impact our ability to deliver differentiated margins on a go-forward basis. Nigel Coe : That's great. And then my follow-up question is on the Control Systems organic growth in the high teens, that's a longer cycle business. And I don't really think about that as necessarily cycling up big or down big. So mean how much of that is coming from sort of created backlog conversion with lead times, maybe some chip lead times coming down? And sort of how do we think about that going forward? Do you think you can maintain above-average growth rates in control systems and software? Ram Krishnan : Yes. Nigel, Ram here. Yes, I think this particular quarter end this year, I think in the second half, the lead times catching up and better supply chains and shipping backlog is what is driving the significant growth in our systems business. But with that said, the project funnel is very good. The KOB 3 is very good. So our expectations are the momentum in that business should continue into 2024. Operator : Next question will be from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Well, so you reiterated your mid-single-digit order growth forecast for this year and you came in at 3% this quarter despite the discrete market slowdown, you obviously gave us the new funnel of opportunities. with mid-20% organic growth. So does that mean that Emerson's orders could reaccelerate from here? Or how do you think about that given the markets that you laid out? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. Certainly, Andy, we feel confident in that mid-single-digit guide that we laid out a quarter ago and believe we'll exit the year in that rate. The process in hybrid orders are in the high single digits as we exited the quarter, and that's where a significant amount of the momentum lies not just in the capital expansion but related to just everyday business activity. Of course, offset by the discrete markets that we talked about through the quarter. We still feel very confident that we'll inch up from where we ended the quarter here slightly. Andy Kaplowitz : Lal, and then maybe I could ask you a more philosophical question on AspenTech. I know at this point, it announced its guidance for FY '24, low double-digit ACV growth and he agreed not to buy Micromine and announced a big repurchase. Are there any lessons learned as you and Antonio have worked together now for a little over a year? And given AspenTech FY '24 guidance, do you see a nice uptick in APM's contribution to your EPS in '24? Lal Karsanbhai : No. Look, we continue to deliver on the synergy plan. I think that's point number one, not just in terms of pursuit of business collaboration between the selling organizations. But most importantly, as I highlighted in the presentation around technology. And it's that technology tie-in that ultimately will differentiate our offerings in the marketplace. Number two. Look, over the quarter, we did a lot of work together. I think I feel really good about the plan that AspenTech laid out, the way it was communicated yesterday. I thought it was very succinct and clear. And I think they'll execute very well as we go through the quarter. There's a lot of collaboration ongoing between our joint teams and momentum continues to build a year into a little over a year into this. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Josh. So well, I'd love to kind of dig in a little bit on backlog here. So flat sequentially. You highlighted the funnel of activity growing pretty materially here. So presumably, the conversion rate starts to pick up a little bit here. Do you think we're sort of in this backlog zone for a while? I think a lot of your other peers out there in multis are starting to dip into backlog with lead time normalization. Just wondering whether you guys sit on that or anything you'd want to call out for the next few quarters? Lal Karsanbhai : Josh, yes, we certainly expect the backlog to come down a few hundred million to the fourth quarter. And it's important to note that its year-over-year at the end of the year, we expect that to be up a little over double digits. So yes, the supply chain easing has certainly helped. But as we look ahead, we see that backlog coming down a little bit in the fourth quarter. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then just kind of going back to Nigel's question, maybe thinking about some of the factors, whether it's '24 or maybe more broadly than that on mix. It seems like with a lot of these large projects, we're going to see more KOB 1, which I think maybe in the older days of Emerson was a bigger mix headwind. But how do you guys think about that now given the change in project composition, et cetera? Michael Baughman : Yes. I think first off, I think just to add to what we said related to Nigel, the KOB 3 business performance has been very strong. Right now, we're running at 65% plus KOB 3 rates with strong performance in North America. So that has really contributed to the outsized leverage we saw in the first three quarters. And we don't expect that to materially change in the next two quarters. But you are right, as our project backlog has built up, and we see project shipments go into '24, that will throttle leverage down to the mid-30s or high 30s rates we've guided to you in the past. So that's really a dynamic you should look for in 2024. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. I think you're absolutely right. I think we're -- there's a fixed handle on the MRO and replacement business. We don't expect that. I think you're absolutely right to change as we go through the year. There's a lot of positive activity there. So feel good about that mix despite a very robust capital project funnel. Operator : Next question will be from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : The incrementals getting back to Nigel's question, I guess, given what happened this year, is there any view on how you view kind of the long-term trajectory on those incrementals. Can you just remind us of what your long-term view on that is and how that kind of plays out? And maybe how the mix may impact that over the next couple of years as perhaps the MRO stuff slows and the project stuff comes on. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. Look, we guided in November, Steve, at 35% through the cycle. Obviously, we're in a very positive point in the cycle at this moment in time. And look, as we look at our mix of business, our tech, geographical mix, as we go into November, we may assess that, but that's the guide that we put out last November. Obviously, we're outperforming that number today. Steve Tusa : And then what is the contribution from kind of price cost this year, just roughly? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. Well, on price in the quarter, we have nine points of volume and five points of price. Price will moderate as we go into the fourth, I think, for the year to 3.5, approaching four points of price in the full year guide of 10% underlying sales. Operator : Next question will be from Andrew Obin, Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : I guess the KOB terminology just refuses to die. Lal Karsanbhai : I'm trying to kill it. Andrew Obin : I'm aware of that. So just a question on supply chain. Are you guys -- some of your competitors are talking about deflation or disinflation, are you seeing an opportunity to extract discounts from your supply chain? Just trying to understand, right, people are talking about inflation subsiding. Are we going to see bottom line benefit for a company like Emerson over the next six to 12 months? Ram Krishnan : Simple answer is yes, Andrew. And we look at, obviously, direct material, indirect material and logistics. So we are going to see deflation or positive NMI or favorable NMI. We are seeing that already in the second half of this year and should see that continue into next year. So it will be favorable for us. What I will say, though, is if you go back to pre-COVID levels, logistics cost, for example, are already there. So we've seen a lot of the logistics benefit already come through on the direct material front, particularly castings, machine parts, electronics we will see deflation in '24 versus '23, but still not back to pre-COVID levels. So maybe the opportunity there for us is continued deflation over the next several quarters as the market eases. Andrew Obin : Excellent. And just a question on Aspen and Emerson. Can you just talk a little bit more about channel integration, because we're hearing that you guys are driving Aspen and Emerson closer together and the relationship is evolving. Just trying to understand how much upside you think or how much margin of safety there is, given that historically, Emerson sales force has been very, very commercial. By incentivizing the salespeople seems like the relationship is going outside the initial channel. Just talk a little bit more about the opportunity. Michael Baughman : Yes. So you are spot on. I think over the last year and certainly in the last six months, the collaboration and the refinement of our go-to-market or joint go-to-market approach, whether it's our project or the white spaces has certainly improved. Yes, you are correct. In certain markets, China, for example, we're collaborating a lot more in terms of having the channels work together, incentive plans for both channels to support each other have been put in place, and that's really stimulating the right behavior, if you will, as both teams go out and pursue competitive displacement opportunities or Aspen, for example, selling on our DeltaV installed base. So yes, I think we'll continue to evolve and progress that. We're being very careful and we're taking it market by market and doing what makes sense. I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all approach to every market. But certainly, the collaboration and the incentives for our sales organizations to collaborate have improved over the last six months. Operator : Next question will be from Chris Snyder from UBS. Please go ahead. Chris Snyder : And congrats on a strong quarter. I guess I wanted to follow up on some of the prior conversation and communication on margins. If our math right, the guide seems to imply a pretty material sequential decline in margins into the fourth quarter despite a step-up in revenue. I guess, is that right? And what's driving that? Pete Lilly : Yes. We will see a decline in margin in the fourth quarter. And if you think about the third quarter that was driven by price and leverage, both of those things will be a little bit lower in the fourth quarter. As we mentioned, the pricing for the full year will be about 4% relative to the five in the fourth quarter or in the third quarter rather, and the mix will also have an effect there as we close out the year. Chris Snyder : I appreciate that. And then just maybe I was looking for some more color on the pipeline of big process projects. Are there some concern in the market that with oil and gas kind of commodities down pretty well off the high, and that includes LNG that there could be some slowdown or pressure on these projects seem to have really good momentum on there. So can you just maybe talk about what you're seeing there and particularly on the traditional energy and the LNG side? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. I'll make a couple of comments, and if Rob wants to add color here. Look, the bulk of what we're seeing is gas. It's not oil where we do see activity in the oils around sustainability, conversions, carbon capture, et cetera, and emissions reduction. But it's the gas activity that I think is very relevant. And that is entirely tied to Europe, to energy security and affordability. And we have not seen any slowdown in the activity, as a matter of fact, an acceleration through the quarter in terms of funding processes. There are seven projects currently out of nine funded and moving forward aggressively and we've booked seven of the nine -- in seven of the nine already. So I haven't seen any evidence, and we have not felt within the business any evidence of any potential pullback in the gas infrastructure build-out or LNG infrastructure build-out. Ram? Ram Krishnan : Yes. And just to add to that, as it relates to our traditional markets, outside of LNG, as Lal mentioned, Chemical is another area where we see continued momentum on projects, certainly in markets like the Middle East, U.S. and China. In terms of our two traditional energy business, FPSO activity in Brazil, Guyana and Asia still continues to be good and moving forward. And then obviously, as we've said, activities in metals and mining, life sciences and nuclear continue to progress. So funnel is diversified. That's what we like about the funnel, and it's not really dependent outside of LNG, not really dependent on one large market, and we feel very confident that on the LNG side, particularly in Qatar, and in the U.S. and East Africa, those projects will move forward. Operator : Next question will be from Deane Dray, RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : I appreciate the spotlight you put on the battery value chain, and we see this as linked to the whole array of these powerful mega projects that are going on now. In fact, battery is one of the biggest there. But just can you give us -- and it's all tied to the reshoring, nearshoring phenomenon? Give us a sense of what kind of win rates you're seeing there within the battery, but also on other projects there's more than 50 different projects over $1 billion. Just if you could cut across those, where else are you winning like in the semiconductor side, other automation projects and so forth? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. No, I'm happy to. So I'll start with LNG, which has been very important, we're winning at a rate higher than 50% so far. We feel really good about continued differentiation in the marketplace and really becoming a de facto automation supplier there. In the hydrogen space at 50% right now, in terms of win rate to the funnel. And across the battery ecosystem, feel very, very strong that very, very confident that, that sits in the 45% to 55% range as well. in fields like life sciences, it's much higher. And that is due to the very strong position of Delta V and the various instrumentation technologies that we bring to bear. So overall, I feel really good about the execution to the projects in the funnel. The pursuits are funded by internal teams. There's multi-vary calling points between engineering companies, end users and contractors. And it occurs at all levels within our organization from Ram and I, down into the card pairing salespeople. Deane Dray : Good to hear. And then second question would be for Mike. Just can you share with us some of the actions on the working capital side? There was really good free cash flow in the quarter. I would imagine you're still in this sort of interim period prior to NATI, where there's only so much you can do on the working capital side. But just give us a sense of what actions near term, how that translates into free cash flow for the year and then into early '24. Michael Baughman : Yes, Dean, we have been really focused on inventory with the supply chain challenges, and we've seen some improvement, and we expect to see some continued improvement as we move into the fourth quarter around inventory. On receivables, with 14% growth, there's going to be a growth in receivables, and I'll tell you that DSOs have stayed flat, and the execution there has been really, really good. If we look ahead, we're expecting for the fourth quarter operating cash flow around $800 million to $900 million and CapEx around $150 million, which should put us in around $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion for the year. So I feel good about the actions that we're taking. There's been a strong focus on inventory with the backdrop of the supply chain moving around and settling, which is good, but that's been our focus. The past new performance has continued to come down on the receivables side, which has been really helpful as well. Deane Dray : Yes. But just let's be clear, a growth in accounts receivable is a high-quality problem. Michael Baughman : That's true. Operator : Next question will be from Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : I apologize if this was addressed. I was on a little late. But Will, can you just give us I thought your updated thoughts on how we're progressing towards regulatory approvals on national instruments and I know your view on 2024 was more subdued than what -- the Street consensus was, but they did post some soft orders here in Q2. So just any thoughts on maybe the trajectory of that business as you work towards close. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, Jeff. Yes, I did cover it in my script, but I'll be happy to repeat the key points. So on the regulatory, we have HSR approval and all the filings have been made, some already obviously obtained. So we feel very confident on the time line to close in the first half of our fiscal 2024. In terms of the business performance, look, it's largely playing out as we built into our model. Orders are down 17% end of the -- that's largely driven by weakness in semiconductor and discrete, but we expect that to improve as the calendar year goes on, and that's how we built into the business case. Having said that, Jeff, had another record quarter. Their sales were up 5% year-over-year. The profitability continued to improve and is very strong, particularly with GPs at very high levels. So we feel excellent about the execution in the business, and we'll continue to stay close on our collaboration to be in our integration planning so that we can hit the ground running on day 1. Jeff Sprague : Great. And then a few things I did here on the Q&A. It was a lot of discussion here on margin leverage, mix and et cetera, just kind of drilling in on price costs specifically. I would imagine we're maybe at or near kind of peak positive gap on that metric. I just wondered if you had opine on that. And maybe more importantly, though, my question is your ability to kind of maintain a poling pricing cost as we kind of look forward here the next several quarters? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. Yes. Ram, why don't you give a... Ram Krishnan : I think we're very confident in maintaining price cost green going into next year. However, price/cost in terms of margin point contribution or the spread will be lower as we go forward. I mean we've had an exceptionally good year here in terms of price performance and obviously, NMI coming down in the second half. That will continue. I mean we will be green price cost, but the margin point contribution from it will be lower in '24, which will have an impact on leverage rates. Operator : Next question will be from Tommy Moll, Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Tommy Moll : Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Well, I think it was a quarter ago maybe before you called out some of the softening on the discrete side. That was originally, I think, in Europe, primarily Germany, but then you highlighted some evolving trends in the U.S. and Asia as well. Can you give us any more insight there? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. We saw that develop through the quarter, Tommy. You're absolutely right. A quarter ago, we talked about weakness that we began to see, particularly in automotive and in packaging OEMs, which, as you know, in Germany, not only serve the German market, but export throughout the world. That did spread into the United States and into parts of Asia. And that developed through the quarter that drove more weakness in that discrete business, which again, makes sense from a cycle perspective for us, but that really developed over the last three months. Tommy Moll : I appreciate it. Well, I also wanted to ask about culture. It's something that you've highlighted throughout your entire tenure as CEO. At the same time, pro forma for NATI, you'll have a much larger organization including pieces that had their own cultures before they were folded into Emerson. So situate us on that journey and give us some insight into what the consolidated approach will be once your portfolio is more mature? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. No, I appreciate the question, Tom. As you know, that's pillar number one and continues to be pillar number one for the organization. We're very excited about the journey we're on. As you know, culture is not something that you change immediately, but as you have to journey. And there's been a lot done in -- across Emerson. What I particularly am excited about is the culture that exists today at National Instruments. It is something that is familiar to us. It is a very attractive place to work, a culture based around learning, curiosity, and that is felt in every engagement that we've had with that team. they have moved ahead in many of the dimensions that we are looking to do here at Emerson, and we're going to be learning from NI and applying a lot of their lessons to what we implement here in our company. So I think there's an accretion there. and an accelerator there from what they've done and. But at the end of the day, it's a company of engineers, who are curious who lean forward, think about tech in differentiated ways, and that's essentially who we are today. Tommy Moll : Thank you. I'll turn it back. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Joe O'Dea of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O'Dea: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess one more just related to the price cost dynamic, I think, pretty clear in terms of what you're seeing on the cost opportunity side. But just overall, how you think that filters through on the price side. So I appreciate that still a positive margin spread even if narrowing. But in conversations you're having, are you seeing a little bit more discussion around that? Are you seeing areas where price is actually moving down? Michael Baughman : No, we expect price to remain positive. The magnitude of the price will be. Obviously, it's not as part -- if on the increases won't be as positive as we saw in the inflationary times of the last couple of years. But our automation business, we have a leadership position in all the markets we play in. We bring a lot of technology to our customers. Obviously, KOB 3, which is the replacement cycle is 65% of our sales. So we'll be positive price going into 2024, even as we execute on the favorable deflation that we will see on purchases like electronics, castings, machine parts. Joe O'Dea: Got it. And then also wanted to circle back, a couple of comments on near-shoring and I think kind of a broadening out maybe of the trends there. And so if you could expand on that a little bit and just touch on sort of the evolution of what you've seen, maybe kind of led in North America, but just sort of what inning you think we're on? Are you seeing any kind of stabilization in those trends in the U.S., but you're seeing kind of growth budding in other regions. And so if you can touch on those regions and verticals a little bit more? Lal Karsanbhai : I'll say a few comments and have asked Ram to add a little color as well. Look, I think we're in early innings, certainly early innings in terms of the infrastructure, chips, near-shoring activities, and it's broad-based. it's driven clearly in the EV value chain that I've described in Life Sciences, semiconductor, which will benefit in National Instrument significantly as well. But it's Australia, it's Europe, it's the United States with very robust activity across all world areas. But I have to say, based on just the pace of activity, I do believe there are many innings yet to be played here. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our conference today.

Colleen Mettler : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Emerson's fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. Today I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; Chief Financial Officer, Mike Baughman; and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Please join me on Slide 2. This presentation may include forward-looking statements which contain a degree of business risk and uncertainty. Please take time to read the safe harbor Statement and note on the non-GAAP measures. I will now pass the call over to Emerson's President and CEO, Lal Karsanbhai, for his opening remarks. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Colleen. Good morning. 2023 was an exceptional year for Emerson. The management team, alongside the Board of Directors, boldly delivered across the three dimensions of our value creation strategy. Firstly, culture. Our management team just completed a trip around the world where we had the opportunity to engage with our customers and our teams. It was an energizing trip and it was evident to me that the changes we are driving in the culture of Emerson are embraced as evidenced by our engagement survey. 2023 was an important year. We made significant progress across multiple dimensions of culture. We rolled out an employee value proposition, advanced our diversity and inclusion metrics, and made significant strides in our sustainability targets as well as launching a differentiated talent engine program. Second, our portfolio transformation is largely complete. The Copeland divestiture and more importantly, the acquisition of NI have enabled us to create an Emerson focused on automation with a cohesive, higher growth, higher profit margin, diversified portfolio aligned to the critical macro secular drivers, energy security and affordability, near assuring, sustainability and decarbonization, and digital transformation. I would like to welcome Ritu Favre and the NI family to Emerson. This is an exciting time. With NI, our technology stack is unequaled, and we are in position to continue to push the boundaries of automation to meet our customers' needs. Thirdly, execution. The Emerson management system is delivering differentiated results. Underlying sales for 2023 grew 10%. GPE expanded 330 basis points to 49%. And adjusted Segment EBITDA expanded 220 basis points to 25% after delivering yet another year of over 50% leverage. Adjusted earnings per share in 2023 grew 22% to $4.44 and free cash flow was $2.4 billion. Orders growth exited the year at 5% and we grew across all world areas. We had strong price realization in the business at 4% for the year. And MRO represents 65% of our revenue with now a $150 billion installed base around the world. And we exited the year with $6.6 billion of backlog, up 12% year-over-year. We delivered on innovation in 2023. It was a year of significant releases in our DeltaV platform, Aspen models, and intelligent devices. Our R&D spend as a percent of sales rose to 7% in 2023. Cost management is the way of life at Emerson. The differentiated leverage of 53% is reflective of aggressive cost actions across our business. We also delivered on commitments of no stranded costs related to the Copeland transaction, and will be delivering on the $100 million corporate cost takeout by the end of 2024 through significant transformational activities driving certain functional activities to centralization and best cost locations. I am humbled by the exactness of our performance And I'm certainly optimistic about the future of our company. I'd like to express my appreciation to our customers who increasingly place their trust in Emerson to solve the world's most challenging problems. And lastly, in my opening remarks, I'd like to say I am but one of over 70,000 Emerson team members around the world. I'd like to thank our global employees for your passion, hard work, and energy that you bring to Emerson every single day. Please turn to Slide 3. As I said earlier, and it bears repeating, 2023 was an exceptional year. We are excited to run this cohesive high growth and diversified portfolio. The financial performance was differentiated with double-digit underlying sales growth, 53% operating leverage, and 22% adjusted EPS growth. As we look ahead, 2024 is expected to be another strong year. Operating leverage, excluding NI, is expected to be in the mid to high 40s, and adjusted EPS is expected to be $5.15 to $5.35, including roughly $0.35 to $0.40 contribution from NI. We hit the ground running on October 11, as soon as we closed the transaction, to begin executing the synergy plan and we expect it to provide early benefits in 2024. We are expecting 4% to 6% underlying sales growth, driven by our focus and commitment to winning in our growth platforms, and leveraging our innovation. Energy transition, industrial software, life sciences and metals and mining are expected to remain resilient parts of our portfolio and we are utilizing our leading technology, customer relationships, installed base and expertise to capture investments in these markets. While discrete markets are down in both our factory automation business and test and measurement, we are expecting recovery in the second half of the year. Turning to Slide 4 for some additional details on how we finished the year. 2023 was a remarkable operational year for Emerson. Starting with the orders performance, our teams executed exceptionally throughout the year. We won in the marketplace. We won in markets like LNG, hydrogen, renewables, life sciences, and metals and mining, resulting in 5% orders growth for the year. This shows our portfolio relevance and leadership position for our customers. Orders were also up 5% in Q4, led by double-digit order growth in China and the rest of Asia. Underlying sales were up double digits for the year, exceeding our initial expectation of 6.5% to 8.5% last November and in line with our August guidance. The strength was widespread across the organization with all world areas growing 9% to 10% and both business groups growing 10%. I am most proud of our performance around operating leverage this year. 53% is differentiated. It is a testament to our Emerson management system and our operational talent, which drove strong performance. Adjusted EPS ended the year at $4.44, beating the midpoint of our original November guidance by $0.37 and near the top of our August guidance. Lastly, free cash flow of $2.4 billion was up 35% year-over-year and above our August guidance. Turning to Slide 5. Our 2023 performance caps three strong years of execution, demonstrating the power of our Emerson management system and its ability to create value for our shareholders. We embarked on a transformational journey of Emerson in 2021 and remained focused on execution. Underlying sales growth of 7% and 10% in 2022 and 2023, respectively, shows the leadership position of our automation technology and our world-class sales organization. It is also indicative of our market share expansion within the $160 billion served automation market. Our ability to both leverage our $150 billion installed base as evidenced by our MRO sales in 2023 of 65%, and win new projects are strengths of this company and critical to the long-term success of this business. As we invest more in digital technology and software, we are also seeing the benefits to gross margins, which have expanded 470 basis points to 49% since 2021. Strong price discipline and differentiated technology have also provided positive contributions, and the addition of NI will further expand our gross margins. This enabled strong operational leverage across the business. Over 50% leverage for 2022 and 2023 is distinguished amongst industrials. Cost discipline remains part of the DNA at Emerson, driving further cost productivity and margin expansion. Put all this together and Emerson has delivered back-to-back years of 20-plus-percent EPS growth. Please turn to Slide 6. I want to provide a couple strategic updates on our business. In October, we hosted Emerson Exchange Immerse in Anaheim, California. The event showcased our control systems and software technology and highlighted our integration with AspenTech throughout different solutions and industries. Featuring over 1,400 attendees and over 100 customer presentations, the week was spent discussing the exciting roadmap of our Delta V, Ovation, and AspenTech products and working with customers to solve their toughest challenges. This was all reflected in our keynote presentations from three important customers, Syzygy, a provider of electric catalyst reactor technology, Biogen, and Tesla, who discussed their automation challenges in partnership with Emerson. These types of engagements not only help our users understanding of our current products, but also provide important inputs into our next generation products and innovation. Throughout this event, we highlighted our boundless automation vision, the next generation automation architecture that Emerson is uniquely positioned to deliver based on our leadership position in intelligent devices, control systems, and software. This vision empowers our customers to unlock and access all their operational data, enabling better decisions through analytics and optimization. It also enables customers to balance their production and sustainability goals through enterprise management and a unified software platform. On Slide 7, as part of this vision, we continue to accelerate innovation across four priority domains, disruptive measurement technologies, software defined automation systems, self-optimizing asset software, and our sustainability portfolio. Each of these areas provide stepping stones to enable the boundless automation vision. At Immerse, we introduced many significant new products to our leading DeltaV portfolio. First, DeltaV Version 15 Feature Pack 1 is one of our biggest rollouts in recent history. The package includes enhancements to software like DeltaV Live, the most advanced DeltaV HMI ever developed, and the introduction of a subscription controller, PK Flex. It also includes the DeltaV Edge Environment, a first-of-its-kind edge solution, allowing users to securely move data into their enterprise environments. As we look at the next generation of software solutions and automation platforms, this is a key enabler to unlocking data that users previously discarded. Throughout the rest of the organization, we are also making focused investments in strategic areas. This includes next-generation intelligent devices to further cement our leadership position in our measurement and analytical portfolio, and relevant additions to our sustainability portfolio. At AspenTech, many of the new releases are focused on enabling sustainability and energy transition segments, in addition to further building out capabilities like AI and DataWorks to enable self-optimizing asset management. Please turn to Slide 8. On October 11, we closed the acquisition of NI and announced we will report the business as a new test and measurement segment in 2024. We are very pleased with the progress already in the first month with NI and are excited about the opportunities in this business. We remain committed to the $165 million of synergies by the end of year five, resulting in approximately 31% adjusted segment EBITDA when moving stock comp to corporate. As we have openly stated, NI completes the significant portion of our portfolio transformation, and we are excited to execute as a new company. We will, however, continue to be active with bolt-on acquisitions that fill technology gaps in our business, and we have the balance sheet flexibility to do so. These will be prioritized in four segments we introduced a year ago, industrial software, test and measurement, factory automation, and smart grid solutions. In the fourth quarter, we completed two of these bolt-on acquisitions. Flexim is a global leader for clamp-on ultrasonic technology measuring liquids, gases, and steam. The business is highly complementary to our existing leading flow portfolio consisting of Coriolis, DP Flow, Mag & Vortex, and will also serve attractive growth markets in the energy transition. We also completed the acquisition of Afag in the fourth quarter, a highly strategic asset in the factory automation market. Afag\u2019s electric linear motion solutions, combined with our existing pneumatic motion offering creates a leading motion portfolio for discrete industries in a $9 billion TAM. Please turn to Slide 9. As I mentioned, the large pieces of our portfolio transformation are behind us. And this slide shows that we were able to accomplish what we were able to accomplish over the last few years. We have three main objectives that I communicated when we started this journey. First, cohesiveness, which we now have with an unmatched technology stack. Second, diversification. Discrete is now our second largest end market with further opportunities to expand into attractive diversified industries. And third, our growth is aligned to secular growth drivers. This alignment to energy security and affordability, sustainability and decarbonization, near-shoring, and digital transformation will allow Emerson to move to a more secular and less cyclical business profile. $36 billion worth of transactions. Disposing of assets with low single digit growth profiles and adding businesses we expect to grow cumulatively in the high single-digits to low double-digits. The profitability improvement is also remarkable. Trading 30% GP businesses for those that operate 70% plus gross profits, which are already seeing -- which we are seeing the benefits of today. We are all energized by the opportunity we have with this new Emerson. Please turn to Slide 10. Our current strategic funnel is now over $10 billion in opportunity, with nearly two-thirds residing in our growth platforms. We're also encouraged by the activity of projects already in the funnel, considering the interest rate environment and global uncertainty. In the fourth quarter, Emerson was awarded over $500 million of project content, with over 60% of those in our growth platforms. This includes strategic wins in LNG, carbon capture, hydrogen, life sciences, and metals and mining. These successes are indicative of our team's focus and our technology's relevance within these markets. As we look at further diversifying our portfolio into hybrid and energy transition markets, 2023 was a fundamental foundational year. Specifically, there were three highly strategic projects to highlight. First, Emerson was selected to automate five different plants for Samsung Biologics as it standardizes on our DeltaV automation platform. The Emerson solution provides control for both production skids and for plant-wide operations. We are also currently engaging with a customer on the potential to leverage AspenTech software for future expansion. Secondly, in the third quarter, we highlighted Emerson's selection for the Port Arthur LNG project with Bechtel Energy and Sempra. This quarter, we are pleased to announce we were also selected for another large-scale world-class LNG facility in the United States. The Rio Grande LNG project from Bechtel Energy and NextDecade, located in Texas, will be capable of producing 17.6 million metric tons per annum of LNG across three liquefaction trains. Emerson is providing much of our leading technology, including analytical and measurement technology, and control, pressure relief, and isolation valves. And finally, AspenTech was awarded a Synergy win in the most recent quarter with a world-leading pulp and paper producer. Emerson's DeltaV system is already installed at the site, and through this relationship with the customer, Emerson was able to bring AspenTech to the table. Through this engagement, the customer chose to displace the current incumbent provider of adaptive process control software and instead move to AspenTech. This example demonstrates the power of our Emerson AspenTech integrated solutions and the opportunity to expand AspenTech utilizing our global sales channel. These wins and the continued evolution of the funnel provide a strong foundation as we head into 2024. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike Baughman. Mike Baughman : Thanks, Lal, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 11 that summarizes our fourth quarter financial results, which were in line with our expectations. Underlying sales growth was 5%, growing off a tough comp in 2022 when sales shifted from the third quarter into the fourth quarter due to China shutdowns and electronic component shortages. Price contributed approximately 4 points of growth. As expected with our typical seasonality, backlog declined sequentially about $300 million to $6.6 billion, up 12% versus where we entered 2023. Software and control sales grew 2% on an underlying basis, which now includes AspenTech as we lapped a year of ownership. The control systems and software business came in largely as expected and it was comparing against a very strong prior year Q4. AspenTech tends to see lower sales volume in our fiscal Q4 due to the timing of renewals and its sales can be more variable due to ASC 606 accounting. The sales were on forecast and importantly ACV showed strong growth at 10.9% year-over-year. Intelligent devices grew 6%, led by process and hybrid exposed businesses, mainly measurement and analytical and final control. Our discrete automation business was down in the quarter with softer-than-expected demand and Europe and China weakness impacting this business. Emerson adjusted segment EBITDA margin improved 80 basis points to 25.5%. Operating leverage excluding AspenTech was 45%. Volume, margin accretive price cost, which included net material deflation and ongoing productivity programs contributed to the margin improvement. Adjusted EPS grew 21% to $1.29. Lastly, free cash flow for the quarter of $838 million was up 17% versus the prior year. Please turn to Slide 12. As Lal summarized, 2023 was an exceptional year for Emerson. Underlying sales growth was 10% with 4 points of price contribution. Software and control and intelligent devices both finished with underlying sales growth of 10%. All geographies reported strong sales growth with Americas up 10%, Europe up 10%, and Asia, Middle East, and Africa up 9%. Emerson adjusted segment EBITDA margin improved 220 basis points to 25%. Operating leverage excluding AspenTech was 53%. As we've talked about throughout the year, this was driven by leverage on double-digit sales growth, strong execution by our operations teams, margin accretive price cost, and favorable product and project mix. Adjusted EPS grew 22% to $4.44 with $0.27 of contribution from AspenTech. Lastly, free cash flow of $2.4 billion was up 35% versus the prior year. This includes approximately $100 million from the interest on undeployed proceeds from the Copeland transaction. For the year, free cash flow conversion of adjusted earnings was 88%, slightly ahead of our expectations. This also represents a 15.6% free cash flow margin, a metric we plan to utilize moving forward. Slide 13 details the drivers of adjusted EPS growth from the prior year. Operational performance was exceptional. 10% underlying sales growth and 53% segment level operating leverage contributed $0.77 of year-over-year EPS growth. FX was a $0.12 headwind. Stock comp was a $0.16 headwind versus the prior year, due primarily to the mark-to-market accounting for the company's old stock compensation plan, which was mostly offset by pension and other corporate items. The reduced share count resulting from the $2 billion share repurchase contributed $0.14, and the Copeland note receivable interest contributed $0.05 to adjusted EPS for the year. Overall, adjusted EPS grew 22% year-over-year to $4.44. Please turn to Slide 14. We believe 2024 is shaping up to be another good year of financial performance. Our end markets remain generally resilient, evidenced by 5% underlying orders growth in Q4 and for all of 2023. This has resulted in healthy backlog levels, which were up 12% versus where we entered 2023, giving us good visibility into 2024 sales. We also have good visibility through our MRO business, which was 65% of 2023 sales. This day-to-day replacement business gives us good perspective on pace of business and remains constructive. Lastly, we are entering 2024 with a $10 billion-plus funnel, up $3 billion from where we entered 2023. This all feeds our 2024 outlook. Process and hybrid end markets remain strong, driven by secular trends like energy security, sustainability and decarbonization, nearshoring and digital transformation. We expect process and hybrid sales growth of mid to high single-digits in 2024. We continue to see investments moving forward in energy transition markets like LNG, nuclear, hydrogen, carbon capture and renewables. We continue to see nearshoring investments here in the US and around the world in life sciences and metals and mining, especially midstream metals processing and refining, which is being expanded to the United States and Europe. These secular trends in process hybrid end markets and our ability to help customers be successful give us confidence in our 2024 outlook. Discrete markets are obviously in a different part of the cycle, which impacts both our discrete automation and test and measurement businesses. Orders have been negative for two to three quarters but we expect this to begin to turn positive in the second half of 2024. We expect underlying sales to be flat to up low single-digits in 2024 for our discrete businesses -- for our discrete business. From a world areas perspective, it should continue to be a balance, and we expect each world area to grow in the mid-single-digit range. Please turn to Slide 15, where we have outlined our 2024 guidance. Our later cycle exposure, robust backlog and continued orders resiliency support our 2024 guidance for underlying sales growth of 4% to 6%. We expect both intelligent devices and software and control to be within this guidance range for underlying sales. Test and measurement is excluded from 2024 underlying sales and is expected to add another 10 to 10.5 points to reported growth or approximately $1.6 billion of sales. FX is expected to be a 1 point tailwind. We remain committed to driving differentiated incremental margins through our operational execution. Operating leverage, which now includes AspenTech, but excludes test and measurement, is expected to be in the mid to high 40s in 2024, which includes cost savings from our corporate and platform rightsizing. Price/cost will continue to be margin accretive in 2024 and ongoing productivity and cost savings will drive further benefits. We expect adjusted EPS to increase from $4.44 in 2023 to between $5.15 and $5.35 in 2024, an 18% increase at the midpoint. This includes approximately $0.35 to $0.40 from NI, inclusive of stock compensation and approximately $0.32 to $0.34 from AspenTech. There are some movements below the line in stock compensation, pension and other corporate items, which roughly offset year-over-year. This detail can be found in the appendix. As a reminder, stock compensation from NI is now reported in our corporate stock compensation line item. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $105 million. Lastly, free cash flow is expected to be $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion, which we will discuss in more detail on the next slide. For the first quarter, we expect underlying sales to increase 6.5% to 8.5% with leverage in the mid-30s. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1 and $1.05, a 31% increase at the midpoint. NI is expected to contribute approximately $0.05. As I mentioned, we will discuss some additional details on Slide 16 regarding our free cash flow. We ended 2023 with free cash flow of $2.4 billion or 15.6% of sales. This included just over $100 million of after-tax cash from interest on the undeployed proceeds from the Copeland transaction, which will not repeat in 2024. Taking this into consideration and starting from a foundation of approximately $2.3 billion of free cash flow, we expect approximately $300 million of contribution from NI operations and another $350 million increase from base operations. This would have resulted in a free cash flow margin of approximately 16.8% or $2.9 billion of free cash flow. However, we have two headwinds in 2024. First, we expect approximately $200 million of acquisition-related cash payments associated with the NI and bolt-on acquisitions. Second, we are expecting an elevated CapEx spend related to facility expansions, which will increase our CapEx to approximately 2.5% of sales, up from our historical and future expected rate of approximately 2% of sales. Including these two headwinds bring us to our guidance of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion of free cash flow or 15.2% to 15.4% free cash flow margin. Before we turn the call over to Q&A, I will quickly discuss capital allocation on Slide 17. We remain committed to disciplined capital allocation. Internal development and organic growth investments remain a high priority. This accelerated in 2023 with R&D spend now representing 7% of revenue and NI will further mix this up in 2024. This increase was driven by increased innovation in our four priority breakthrough domains, disruptive technologies and measurement, sustainability, software-defined automation systems, and self-optimizing asset software. We also remain committed to the dividend and announced today, we are beginning our 68th year of consecutive increased dividends with our $0.525 per share declared dividend this quarter. The right side of this chart is where we have flexibility. We will continue to be active in pursuit of strategic bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen our portfolio in targeted areas and we will remain committed to strong returns on these investments. Finally, we plan to have approximately $500 million of share repurchases in 2024. We are energized as we enter the new fiscal year, and we are focused on the execution of our plans. Thanks for your attention. I will turn it back to the operator to open the call for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple specific NATI questions if I could. Some noise with the bolt-ons. So could you just be clear for NATI revenues in 2024? And also, if you could provide any color on how their orders progressed in the fourth quarter? And finally, maybe a little bit of around how much of that synergy target happens in the first year. Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah. Hi, Jeff. Lal here. Good morning. So on the revenue, as Mike stated, $1.6 billion is the assumption. It's not in the underlying sales as we reported. Orders in the environment, as I expressed in my presentation, are still challenging in the business, exiting the quarter at down 16% NI which is very much aligned to the plan that we had in place. And we do expect much like in our core discrete markets, orders to flatten out as we get into the second half of the year. So feel very much that they're under in plan from an orders perspective, although still in a challenging environment. And then lastly on synergies. Look, we got off to a really good start, day one. The team's executing very, very well. We haven't given guidance on year one. What I did, I will say is that about half the synergies will be delivered in the first two years. Jeff Sprague : Right. And just as an unrelated question, maybe it's for Mike. But just thinking about the organic guide for 2024, you're exiting here at 4% price with 5% order growth, right? It feels like there's a little bit of room in those organic numbers. Maybe just share how much price is embedded in that 4% to 6% for 2024? Mike Baughman : Yeah. Jeff, the 2024 price assumption is 2%. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Hi, good morning. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Can you just talk about within the cash guidance, what you're assuming on working capital. And then that $250 million that's kind of running through this year, how does all that trend kind of into '25? Mike Baughman : Yeah, I'll start with the second half -- or the second part of the question first. The $250 million is really one-time and in the year related to the acquisitions and some of the higher CapEx that we've got. Steve Tusa : Great. And then just working capital? Mike Baughman : Working capital for the year. Yeah, we exited working capital, trade working capital at about 20.5%, and we're expecting about 50 basis points coming off -- 20.5% of revenue. So we do expect to have a little bit of balance sheet goodness in 2024. Steve Tusa : Great. And then just one last one, just on orders. How do you guys kind of see the funnel stepped up a bit, the backlog, [you had in the] (ph) backlog seasonally, but how do you guys going to see orders and backlog trending over the course of the year here? Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah, I'll comment, Steve. Obviously, we exit at 5%. So we have optimism, and we have momentum out there. Obviously, we have some challenges in discrete, as we talked about in the business. I think as you think about the start of the year, my expectations are flat to low single digits. But as we get into the second half of the year, my expectation is exiting at -- in the mid-single-digit range. And for the full year, somewhere in the low single to mid-single-digit orders. Steve Tusa : Great. And, thanks a lot. Mike Baughman : And then Steve, just on backlog. There -- that pattern holds, there shouldn't be a meaningful change in backlog as we exit 2024. So the backlog should remain healthy. Steve Tusa : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe first off, just looking at Slide 15, so I wanted to understand why the operating leverage steps up after Q1 when the organic sales growth steps down? Is there any one segment or subsegment or something happening with mix that's driving that? And should we assume that that organic sales growth just steadily decelerates through the year? Mike Baughman : Hey, Julian, yeah there is a little bit of mix and I would say the discrete automation softness that we are expecting in the first half of the year plays in on that. There's -- we've been ramping up our spend around growth platforms and innovation. And so as you come into the first quarter, there's a little bit of a year-over-year comparable that plays into that first quarter leverage as well. Julian Mitchell : I see. So it's really discrete, sort of getting better, and that pushes up the op leverage balance of the year. Mike Baughman : That's correct. Again, obviously we're driving restructuring in the discrete business given the trend in the orders and you will see that margin expansion come through in the second half which would drive up the leverage rates. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful, thank you. And then just a quick follow-up would be around, I suppose, historically process cycles in automation followed discrete by around 12 months, and we see discrete is soft now. Are there any sort of specific reasons why process should hold up differently this time versus history instead of following discrete lower later this year? Lal Karsanbhai : It's a good question, Julian. One that we've thought a lot about and been watching very carefully. The fact of the matter is that we have some very unusual secular trends going on in the world right now. I think a lot of our process activity is driven by two -- three critical areas. The near-shoring activity, which impacts life sciences and the metals and mining value chain. The energy affordability and security, which is impacting significant continued investment in liquefied natural gas and nuclear. And thirdly, equally important, sustainability. I think we're past the tipping point in terms of the -- our customers' commitment around sustainability, and we're seeing continued investments there. So whether we believe those will transcend certain economic cycles and that will impact how we should think about the strength of process as we go through 2024. Ram, you have something to add? Ram Krishnan : Yeah, and the other point I'd make, Julian, is the capital spend in the process hybrid industries has been pretty disciplined. There hasn't been a boom in capital to cause a correction as we move forward as opposed to the prior cycles we saw. So I think that disciplined capital spend plus obviously the trends that Lal identified where the sustainability investments provide that tailwind, we expect process to continue to run for a lot longer. Julian Mitchell : I see, so you\u2026 Lal Karsanbhai : Process and hybrid -- and hybrid, yeah. Julian Mitchell : Got it. So the process and hybrid orders growth should stay fairly steady through 2024. Lal Karsanbhai : That is our expectation, yes sir. Julian Mitchell : Fantastic. Thanks for the help. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Julian. Operator : The next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel, your line is now live. Nigel Coe : Okay. The line is live, but I'm not, so sorry for that. So National Instruments, I think that the 4Q fiscal sales were down, I think, high single-digit, organic. Is that the right number? Is my math correct? And it looks like the guide implies flattish to maybe slightly down organic. Just wondering what the profile is on that and anything on orders there would be helpful. Ram Krishnan : Yeah. So, Ram here, Nigel. From an orders perspective, as Lal indicated, the last quarter, which is our fourth quarter, down 16% in orders, we expect orders to remain down for the first half and turn positive in the second half. And you are right, the $1.6 billion that we're guiding will translate to down 5% to 6% for the year from a sales perspective. And sales should turn positive in the fourth quarter. So we'll have down sales for the first three quarters and positive in the fourth quarter. Nigel Coe : Okay, great. I'm sorry I missed the order number. Thanks for clarifying that. And then on the backlog, backlog down from $6.9 billion to $6.6 billion QoverQ, maybe just clarify, I don't think that's unusual from a seasonal perspective. I think it's normal to see 4Q backlog consumption. Was there any FX revaluation impacts there? I just want to make sure that I understand the organic movement there. Mike Baughman : No, that's on a consistent GAAP basis. Nigel Coe : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, everybody. Congrats on all the stuff done. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning, Scott. Lal, it sounds like you were just in China, if you were around the world, and it seems pretty topical to get an update from what maybe you saw there. I'll just leave it there. Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah, I actually, on this particular trip, did not hit China. We'll do that later in the year. I was there in May. But having said that, look, we had a very good year in China. We exited orders at 11% in China. So feel good about the momentum there again. The investments there really around energy security and nearshoring are very significant. Sales were in the mid-single-digits for the year, and -- but we continue to see robustness in our core process and hybrid spaces. And not unlike what Europe and the United States struggling on the discrete side, but certainly the process hybrid strength will continue as we expect into 2024. Scott Davis : And then the discrete in China is negative I'd assume this quarter? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, it is negative in the quarter. Yes, sir. Scott Davis : Okay. I'll pass it on. Thank you, guys. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Scott. Operator : The next question comes from Joe O\u2019Dea with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O\u2019Dea: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. One, just on the NI earnings contribution for the year, $0.05 in the first quarter would be kind of running, I guess, $0.10 a quarter or a little better for the rest of the year. But any more detail on that cadence? Anything that's sort of cost heavy up front and then the progression through the course of the year as you're thinking about that earnings contribution? Lal Karsanbhai : No, I don't have anything else to add, Joe. I mean, obviously, there's a -- as Ram expressed, a volume expansion as we get to the second half of the year that will drive leverage and incremental profits, but that's really what the tale of the tape there is. Joe O\u2019Dea: Okay, and then on the R&D side and the step up to 7%, it sounds like it goes even higher in \u201824. Any context on that? And then sort of an additional insight on sort of the products and verticals that are getting outsized investments, as well as what your returns focus is on R&D, the prioritization around share gain or sort of the revenue dollars that you want, returns on R&D investment, any sort of context around that? Mike Baughman : From a dollars perspective, yeah, we get the benefit of Aspen coming in, that mixes us up, and then NI comes in, and that also mixes us up. So you'll continue to see that commitment to growth, innovation, accelerate and increase as we move on. And in terms of where the investment is going, a lot of the investment really is across the four technology areas we've consistently showed you guys. It's disruptive measurement which is the sensing technology in our measurement technologies business, our automation system, the next generation automation system that Lal referenced in the presentation, and also collaborative technology development with Aspen around asset performance management. So those are the areas where we see lots of opportunity in terms of new-to-the-world type innovation that we can drive as an automation company and that's where the investment is going. Joe O\u2019Dea: Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Christopher Glynn : Thank you. Good morning. I was curious about the funnel conversion comments. I think last quarter you indicated that the conversion rates of those are picking up as the size of the projects ramps and some of the newer technologies and applications. So, just curious, trend line if you see in further acceleration and how much of that notion is baked into the fiscal \u201824 guidance or could that be an opportunity? Lal Karsanbhai : No. Hey, Chris, Lal here. No, look, we continue to see the funnel expand organically to begin with. So it did grow from quarter over quarter, which is why we thought it was important to show you. But what's most interesting, it's growing in the right spots for us. It's growing along the growth platforms that were -- where we have the focus of the organization. So that comprises about $6.6 billion of the funnel today, of which energy security and transition is a big part of that. Sustainability and decarbonization is a large part of it. If you look at the wins, they are very much aligned in the same way as the funnel, winning at about 60% aligned on the growth platforms-ish with energy transition a big part of what we are converting here. So feel really good about it. I -- we're watching it carefully, of course, in terms of movement through FID and other elements, but at this point in time, continue to have optimism, particularly products that are purely connected to national security, nearshoring, or energy affordability elements. So, feel pretty good about what we see in front of us. Christopher Glynn : Thanks. And if I could ask another on discrete, what kind of impacts are you seeing in terms of channel versus end demand? Ram Krishnan : From a channel perspective, I mean, if you're referencing destocking, we're not seeing that. The discrete slowness is purely market driven, certainly European machine builders, China is an end market, and an overall slowdown in the factory automation segment in North America. And you see that with obviously a lot of our peers that have a lot more exposure and discreet. Frankly, versus our peers, we're holding our own in terms of the order rate decline in discreet, and we do expect to see a second half \u201824 positive orders for the business. Christopher Glynn : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Well, I think last quarter when you began to talk about FY \u201824, you mentioned more normalized incrementals in the mid 30% range, but you're guiding to mid to high 40% ex-test and measurement. So could you give us a little more color into the assumptions? I know you get price for \u201824 and you're starting off a little lower, but it seems like you're still getting supply chain tailwind benefits. Andrew, how would you assess your performance versus your longer term algorithm of 35%? Is it possible that that algorithm could be a bit conservative? Lal Karsanbhai : It's possible. Yes, Andy. We've been operating in the mid-50s over the last couple of years. There's a significant amount of momentum around cost in the business. As I mentioned, we have tailwinds that will be delivered through the actions we're taking, not just within the segments, but also at corporate as we go through 2024. Now having said that, on the supply chain side, we're on the positive side of most of the measures. Obviously, logistics environment is flipped. And on material flow, generally significantly better. Of course, we fight spot shortages as you'd expect in any business. But generally, we are in a very different world on the supply chain. So that's all very positive. So it's really around execution. Look, we have a -- the gross margins of the business are 49% in 2023. They'll expand further, as Mike described, in 2024. And with that comes an expectation of a higher leverage and a higher incremental for the business. So at this point, feel very comfortable with the guide we put out there for the year in that mid to high 40s which is, I think, differentiated. And we'll really think through what we talk about and guide on a longer-term basis from a financial plan perspective as we go through the year. Mike Baughman : Just to amplify that a little bit, Andy, we've also been talking about this $100 million of corporate platform cost takeout, which has been reading through in the businesses, and we'll read through in the business in '24 as well, which is an uplift for the year. Andy Kaplowitz : It's great to hear. And then I know you want to retire the KOB 1, 2, 3 names, but when we think about \u201824, I think you've been averaging something like 65% KOB3. Would you expect that to hold up at around that level? And what are you seeing on the KOB3 side? Is there just a lot more activity that could also help with margins given that tends to be higher margin work? Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah, no, we certainly expect MRO in the 60% range for 2024, Andy. You're absolutely right. It's the most pricing elastic portion of our business. It's typically replaced like for like within processes. And so we feel we have a great understanding of where the $150 billion of install base is located and we have specific programs across our service organizations and selling organizations to ensure that we mine that and that we keep that product evergreen. So I feel good about that, but in that 60% range, I think would be the right expectation. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate it guys. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Andy. Operator : The next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead. Tommy Moll : Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Lal Karsanbhai : Hi, Tommy. Tommy Moll : Well I wanted to start with a follow-up on discrete. You've called out the weakness there previously. Obviously it's been front and center today. So I'm just curious, were there incremental pockets of weakness you picked up through the last quarter and then as you look through to the second half of the coming fiscal year where you expect a return to growth, is the visibility there more just a comps issue or are there some green shoots in terms of the real underlying demand that you can call out at this point? Lal Karsanbhai : No. So a couple of things. What we're experiencing through the quarter or we have experienced through the quarter is demand-driven weakness. As Ram accurately portrayed, it's not as the stocking element. As a matter of fact, a very small percentage of our business runs through stocking distributors in the discrete side. But nevertheless, it's demand that we really focus on, and it's global weakness across the key markets. Now having said that, the comparables do get easier as we get into the second half. We're not counting on underlying demand conditions in the discrete market significantly improving in the second half. What we're benefiting from is obviously the [competitors] (ph) for us. Tommy Moll : Makes sense. And then if I look at the consolidated outlook you've provided for the first quarter and then the full year, you're starting the year in the high single-digit range, full year in the mid-single-digit range. So there's some deceleration implied there. Is there some conservatism around there, just given the issues you've called out on the discrete side? Are there comp items that you would point out for us? Lal Karsanbhai : There's nothing extraordinary other than we've got to be cautious on the discrete cycle. Tommy Moll : Great. We appreciate the insight, and I'll turn it back. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Tommy. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Colleen Mettler, Vice President of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead. Colleen Mettler : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Emerson's first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Today I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; Chief Financial Officer, Mike Baughman; and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Please join me on Slide 2. This presentation may include forward-looking statements which contain a degree of business risk and uncertainty. Please take time to read the Safe Harbor statement and note on the non-GAAP measures. I will now pass the call over to Emerson's President and CEO, Lal Karsanbhai, for his opening remarks. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Colleen and good morning. I'd like to begin by thanking the Emerson team for delivering a strong start to 2024. I'd also like to extend my appreciation to the Emerson Board of Directors and to our customers for your continued confidence in us. Our first quarter results demonstrate, the underlying strength of the markets we serve, the meaningfulness of our differentiated technology and the relentless execution of our global teams. Please turn to Slide 3. Q1 was a strong start for Emerson. As we continued our focus on executing and driving value creation for our shareholders. The demand environment remains healthy for process and hybrid markets. We continue to see projects moving forward at a healthy pace in markets like chemical, LNG, life sciences, metals and mining and sustainability and decarbonization. Even in the face of higher interest rates, ongoing geopolitical challenges, and upcoming elections in key global markets, including the U.S. Our customers 2024 CapEx budgets are shaping up constructively, and are largely supportive of the demand environment we are experiencing. This robust environment, along with continued execution by our teams is a key contributor to the Q1 performance. Q1 orders, sales, operating leverage and adjusted earnings, all exceeded expectations, providing confidence to increase our full year guidance. This performance reflects our ability to win with a focused approach to our growth platforms and through continued investments in innovation. It is also a testament to our new differentiated portfolio with leading technology, strong profit margins, and exposure to the important global secular growth markets. This is exhibited by our gross margin and adjusted EBITDA expansion since 2021. Our business is well positioned to capture investments in areas like energy security and affordability, sustainability and decarbonization, digital transformation, and nearshoring. Regarding our portfolio, we continue to reiterate that the large parts of our portfolio transformation are complete, and we do not expect any sizable transactions in 2024. This is a portfolio we designed from the beginning, and we are excited to be executing with this set of businesses. On that note, test and measurement is executing well and had a strong first quarter ahead of our expectations. The quarter performance and an acceleration of synergies provide more confidence, for our full year expectations from the business. Please turn to Slide 4. Emerson's Q1 exceeded all expectations. Underlying orders continued to grow in the mid-single digit range, with 4% growth in Q1. Processing hybrid markets were strong and discrete orders remain down as expected. Multiple LNG projects booked in the quarter, specifically in Europe and the Middle East. Life sciences activity was also strong across the globe, with large project wins in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. The Q1 growth was also supported by some project activity shifting from Q2 to Q1. As you all know, orders can move around quarter to quarter, but we still expect low single digit order growth in the first half of 2024 and mid-single digit order growth for the full year, as discrete demand improves in the second half. Underlying sales for the quarter grew 10%. Again, led by process and hybrid markets, exceeding our expectations. Energy transition markets and metals and mining will both bright spots in the quarter, as we executed numerous projects across Europe, Latin America and Australia. This volume combined with favorable price cost and a strong operational execution resulted in 41% operating leverage in Q1, ahead of our mid 30s expectations. Adjusted EPS was $1.22 up 56% versus 2023. And free cash flow was $367 million, up 51%. Mike Baughman, will go through this specific shortly, but we are excited about our first quarter performance. On Slide 5, our current strategic project funnel grew by approximately $200 million to $10.4 billion, and our growth programs continue to represent nearly two-thirds of this funnel. The continued expansion of the funnel is promising, with existing customers and new entrants continuing to plan and budget for capital projects in the coming years. In the first quarter, Emerson was awarded approximately $400 million of project content, with a little more than half from our growth programs, including three noteworthy deals in energy transition. First, Emerson was selected by DG Fuels in Louisiana, to provide our comprehensive automated automation portfolio, including advanced sensing, control systems, and optimization software for the production of sustainable aviation fuels. These fuels can be used in existing aviation and vehicle engines, and DG Fuels has previously announced agreements with aviation leaders, including Air France, KLM, Delta, and Airbus. Next, Emerson was chosen to automate a lithium ion recycling process based on our metals and mining expertise and experience throughout the lithium value chain. Emerson will provide SungEel HiTech, a specialist in lithium battery recycling in Korea, with advanced automation solutions, for safe and reliable operations at its newest facility that is capable of supplying materials for approximately 400,000 electrical vehicle -- electric vehicles each year. Lastly, Emerson and AspenTech were jointly selected for a large scale LNG liquefaction facility in the Middle East. The project will win represents Emerson's strong presence in the region, including an already sizable LNG installed base. The win is also recognition of the collaboration in synergies between Emerson and AspenTech. As Emerson's DeltaV was selected, along with AspenTech's high simulation, showing the power and differentiation of our combined portfolio. As we look at the continued needs of Europe, and its reliance on gas imports, the Middle East and Africa will play a pivotal role in gas exports. Emerson is uniquely positioned with our local expertise, manufacturing and installed base to serve the region in its LNG growth. These are just three examples of Emerson's continued leadership position in energy transition markets, spanning from established markets like LNG to newer markets, like sustainable aviation fuels. Turning to Slide 6. We remain focused on accelerating innovation for profitable growth. Our recent innovations and our continued technology leadership were recognized by IoT Breakthrough, who named Emerson its 2024 Industrial IoT Company of the Year. IoT Breakthrough received over 4,300 nominations for the 2024 competition, and Emerson was selected based on our unique ability to effectively leverage decades of expertise in digitalization and automation to help the industry transform operations. Among the innovations recognized were Emerson's Ovation green portfolio for manning renewable power assets, Florida cloud solutions to continuously monitor critical production and energy efficiency data in factories, one-click transfer software capable of accelerating the life sciences drug development process, and numerous releases focused on enabling the boundless automation vision, including the DeltaV edge environment. As you recall, boundless automation is Emerson's vision for a cohesive automation ecosystem from device to enterprise. Integrating operations with a flexible automation architecture allows users to have access to all their data, enabling analytics and performance improvements across numerous domains like production, safety, reliability and sustainability. All these innovations will be on display at Emerson's upcoming Users Exchange at the end of February. Emerson Exchange in Dusseldorf, Germany will feature customer case studies, industry sessions and a technology exhibit demonstrating Emerson's leading automation portfolio for process and hybrid industries. New this year are industry-focused exhibits showcasing Emerson's complete solutions for emerging industries like hydrogen, biofuels and carbon capture in addition to growth markets like life sciences and metals and mining. Please turn to Slide 7 for an update on our synergy progress in test and measurement. We effectively use the time between signing and closing to plan all integration and synergy activities, utilizing a world-class M&A methodology as part of our Emerson Management System. Given the strong team collaboration in current market environment, we have accelerated those synergy activities. In the first quarter, we worked closely with the new test and measurement leadership team to aggressively address public company and corporate costs while rapidly implementing Phase 1 of our sales and marketing and research and development transformations. We are also leveraging our Emerson Management System and best practices to progress operational execution and commercial excellence at test and measurement. This includes trade working capital, price realization and procurement efficiencies in logistics and direct materials. These efforts put test and measurement ahead of schedule and give us the confidence to increase the cost synergy target to $185 million, which we now expect to achieve by the end of 2026, two years faster than originally expected. This includes approximately $80 million expected to be realized in 2024. Our planned cost to achieve these synergies increases slightly to $165 million with the majority of the spend expected in the first two years. We still expect adjusted segment EBITDA to reach approximately 31% by year five, as sales grow on the reset cost base. I'll now turn the call over to Mike Baughman to go through more detail on the quarter performance, including test and measurement and our updated 2024 guide. Mike Baughman : Thanks, Lal, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, where we have summarized our first quarter financial results. Underlying sales growth was 10%, led by our process and hybrid businesses. Intelligent devices and software and control grew 11% and 9%, respectively. Discrete automation was down low single digits as expected. All world areas were strong with Asia, Middle East and Africa up 15%, Europe up 10% and the Americas up 8%. Price contributed approximately 2 points of growth. Test and measurement, which is outside of the underlying sales measure, contributed $382 million, exceeding expectations for the quarter. I will discuss test and measurement performance in more detail on the next slide. Backlog is now $7.6 billion, which is up $500 million versus September 30, when excluding test and measurement. Emerson adjusted segment EBITDA margin improved 190 basis points to 24.6%. Volume, margin-accretive price-cost, which included net material deflation, ongoing productivity programs and the test and measurement performance, all contributed to the margin improvement. Operating leverage excluding test and measurement was 41%. Adjusted EPS grew 56% to $1.22, up $0.44 and is a strong start to the year. Double-digit sales growth and 41% operating leverage contributed to the $0.33 of operational improvement year-over-year. Non-operating items contributed $0.11 year-on-year, mainly due to lower stock compensation, which contributed $0.08 versus Q1 of 2023. As a reminder, all legacy mark-to-market stock compensation plans are now complete. Also contributing to the non-operating items were interest income of 4% and share count, which contributed $0.02. Tax was a $0.03 headwind. Lastly, free cash flow for the quarter of $367 million was up 51% versus the prior year. This was in line with our expectations for the quarter as we saw modest improvement in work capital year-on-year. Headwinds related to acquisition fees and restructuring impacted the quarter by approximately $100 million, and CapEx was up $18 million year-on-year. AspenTech sales and ACV were slightly weaker than our expectations for Q1 driven mainly by a delay in renewal from one customer. This slight miss, however, did not have a material impact on total Emerson results versus our expectations. For the quarter, ACV grew close to 10%. And the AspenTech team continues to see strong market dynamics in power transmission and distribution and sustainability and decarbonization while at the same time utilizing Emerson relationships to win in LNG, life sciences and power generation. Turning to Slide 9, we will dive deeper into the first quarter performance of test and measurement. Orders were in line with our expectations, down 17% year-over-year but showed high single-digit sequential improvement led by the strength in aerospace. There was continued softness in semiconductor and automotive markets and ongoing weakness in China. We continue to launch orders as a key indicator and still expect to turn in the second half on easier comps. Sales for the quarter were $382 million, beating initial expectations. This was driven by stronger backlog conversion, lower-than-expected sales during the 11-day stub period prior to closing and a little conservatism in the guide given the timing of the close. Sales were $401 million, including the sales in the stub period. Test and measurement adjusted segment EBITDA margins was 26.5% in the quarter, beating expectations due to higher sales, better-than-expected gross margins and slightly higher cost synergies. The Q1 adjusted segment EBITDA margin benefited from lower-than-expected sales in the stub period against ratable fixed costs. Test and measurement contributed $0.13 in the first quarter, including stock compensation expense and using the test and measurement tax rate, which is in the mid-teens. The stub period dynamic discussed earlier benefited the adjusted EPS contribution by approximately $0.02. Test and measurement's March quarter end sales volume has typically stepped down from its December quarter end. We expect similar seasonality with second quarter sales of approximately $350 million. Second quarter adjusted EPS contribution is expected to be $0.07 driven by leverage on the lower seasonal sales volume, partially offset by synergy savings. Turning to the full year. We have increased our expected adjusted EPS contribution from test and measurement to $0.40 to $0.45 to account for some of the Q1 upside. We still expect sales to be $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion as we continue to watch for the orders turn. Sales volumes are expected to ramp from Q2 to Q4, turning positive in Q4, consistent with our prior expectations. While we expect to sales to be down versus 2023, we expect modest adjusted EBITDA expansion as we recognize the cost synergies. Finally, I would like to thank the test and measurement team for an excellent quarter. The integration work has been performed exceedingly well, and your embrace of the Emerson Management System is very much appreciated. Thank you again to the entire test and measurement team. Please turn to Slide 10, for details of our Q2 and full year 2024 guidance. After our strong Q1 performance, we are increasing our full year 2024 sales and adjusted EPS guidance. We now expect underlying sales growth of 4.5% to 6.5% driven by our process and hybrid businesses. We expect both intelligent devices and software and control, to be within this guidance range for underlying sales. We continue to watch the discrete automation recovery closely, and we now expect sales to turn positive in Q4 consistent with test and measurement. Full year discrete automation underlying sales are now expected to be down in the low single-digit range. FX is expected to be approximately flat versus 2023 compared to a 1-point headwind embedded in our November guidance. Operating leverage, excluding test and measurement, is now expected to be in the low to mid-40s in 2024 versus the mid-to high 40s guidance from November. A modest reduction in our full year target is solely attributed to the move in FX as the 1% increase in sales volume comes in at a lower margin. Our adjusted EPS range increases from $5.30 to $5.45 driven by our Q1 performance. AspenTech is still expected to contribute approximately $0.32 to $0.34. Lastly, we are maintaining our free cash flow guidance of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. Share repurchase is expected to be approximately $500 million, of which $175 million was completed in Q1. For the second quarter, we expect underlying sales to increase 3.5% to 5.5% with leverage in the low to mid-40s. Tougher comps in discrete automation are expected to have an impact on reported sales growth for the quarter. However, volumes are expected to improve sequentially from Q1. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.22 and $1.26. And with that, we will now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Lal, I think your backlog at $7.6 billion, it was up relatively significantly, even excluding test and measurement addition with the orders, as you said, a plus 4%. Can you talk about organic order visibility going forward? It seems like process/hybrid has been relatively strong as you thought. Can you sustain that mid-single-digit kind of order growth going forward? And then have you seen an inflection yet in NATI-related orders? Lal Karsanbhai : Hi, Andy, no, happy to give you some color on the orders. So obviously, as you know about our business, orders can fluctuate on a quarter-to-quarter basis, which is why we guided in that lower single-digit range in the first half of the year, but finishing the year in the mid-single-digit range, as we are now. We have a high degree of confidence about that based on two factors, Andy, the first being our MRO business continues to be relatively strong. It represented approximately 65% of the revenue in Q1, and we expect that to remain robust as we go through the remainder of the year. And that provides us a strong base of order activity. Secondly, the conversion in the funnel. We booked approximately $400 million that represented almost a little over 90 projects that we won out of the funnel in the first quarter. The funnel grew despite that. And we continue to see activity, particularly in energy transition driven by the Middle East and Africa, in the sustainability area, life sciences, and of course, a tremendous amount of activity in metals and mining. So from an underlying Emerson perspective, the focus really is process and hybrid to continue to provide that underlying strength through the year. Now what we will see is a recovery in discrete in the second half, and that's what we've got baked in here. We are still in the lower single digits negative right now in our discrete markets. It's really demand-driven, as we've been talking about for the last couple of quarters. We do expect a recovery in orders into the second half, of course, between comps and obviously some demand elements there. As far as NI is concerned, it's very much on plan to what we expect in terms of orders. We do also believe that there's a second half positive return on the order activity. And we're starting to see early signs in markets, particularly like semiconductor, as you see these companies come out and report. So very much on plan on both ends and which gives us confidence in the underlying strength of the order activity, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Helpful. You obviously had a good quarter and raised the outlook. But maybe just on free cash flow, you didn't change your guidance despite the better quarter and outlook. Did you raise your acquisition-related costs? Is CapEx going up? Anything that you could talk about on that side or on the working capital side? Mike Baughman : Andy, it's Mike. I'll take that one. Yes, the guide was maintained at $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. And with respect to the $250 million that we called out in November, that's tracking right on plan. About $100 million in the quarter plus the cap, that's on the operating cash flow items, mostly integration-related. And then we did see a little bit elevated CapEx, again, very much in line with expectations. We thought a lot about the guide, obviously. And just to go through a little bit of the math, we -- while we took up the earnings, we took up the sales, the net of that is about $50 million in cash flow, still within the $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. So we elected not to take it up given where we set first quarter. But certainly sitting here today, I can tell you we feel better about the cash flow guide than we did three months ago, and it's all going to plan. Andy Kaplowitz : That\u2019s great. Appreciate the color guys. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Hi, good morning. Can you just talk about the -- just maybe the bridge, a little more clarity there from the $0.13 you did for NATI to the $0.07? It doesn't look like all of that account was accounted for by a $30 million sales decline. And then, I guess, on a -- just when you look out to this $1.55 billion guidance, going from what you've done in the first half, do we expect that to be kind of linear from the $350 million in Q2 in sales? Or is it kind of heavily loaded in the fourth quarter? Mike Baughman : Yes. Steve, it's Mike. I'll talk a little bit about the test and measurement performance and the EPS performance in the quarter. We talked a little bit about this stub dynamic, which really was simply the early 11-day period that we didn't own them the first part of the quarter. The sales were much lower than we expected. We expected something more ratable. They were not ratable. And that drove about $0.02 of improvement from what we expected. And the business leverages, as you know, really nicely. So pushing those sales out into the quarter drove part of that $0.13 performance. Now of that, there was also some Q1 sales that we were expecting in Q2. And so when we thought about the guide, we took that $0.08 beat and we rolled $0.05 forward, and that's where we landed. So great performance on test and measurement, and we're really off to a great start there. Ram, do you want to talk about the... Ram Krishnan : The second part of the question, yes, I think it's not all in Q4. So you'll see evenly distributed in Q3 and Q4, it will step up from the $350 million. So we feel pretty good about the $0.40 to $0.45 as we sit here. Steve Tusa : Right. And just one last one, just on the discrete. You guys have been a little more steady on that discrete performance. So you're -- relative to some of your peers who had a very strong backlog liquidation in the second half of last year, you guys kind of started to see some of that weakness. So the comps start getting easier in the fourth quarter, correct, the year-over-year comps? Ram Krishnan : Yes, actually, in the third quarter from -- and third and fourth quarter should be good quarters for us from a discrete perspective, correct. Mike Baughman : And orders. Ram Krishnan : And orders. And then sales will turn positive in Q4. Steve Tusa : Right. On an easier comp. Ram Krishnan : Correct. Steve Tusa : Yes. Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Appreciated. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Hello. Good morning, everyone. Lal, two for me. First one, just on LNG. Obviously, it's a global business, and you talked about the Middle East. But just give us your perspective on what the administration has done on approvals in the U.S. and how that might impact your business, the funnels and anything related on your mind. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. No, certainly, we're disappointed with the administration's decision to hold permitting -- export permitting regarding LNG, not just from an Emerson perspective, from an overall -- as an American, to be very honest. But it is a global business. We have significant activity ongoing in Qatar, of course, in Mozambique and in Guyana, which will provide ample activity and gives us confidence in the forecast that we have in the funnel movement. In terms of the projects we're executing in North America, we don't see any meaningful impact to 2024 at this point in time. The projects that we have won have the approvals required, not just for construction, transportation, but ultimately for exports. And our partners, Bechtel and others that we've discussed on these calls, have given us the confidence, Jeff, that we are -- that 2024 is relatively solid. Then as we go forward, we'll see. We continue to see accelerated strength in the East Coast of Africa and in the Middle East, and there's some activity up in Canada as well. So we'll see where that goes related to the U.S. decision. Jeff Sprague : And then just to be totally clear, Lal, the project funnel that you illustrate for us quarterly, does some of the non -- I guess, pending approval U.S. projects, are they in that funnel? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, they're in the funnel. Depending on the year that we had, expectation of funnel looks at about a three-year lens of activity. So they are in the funnel there. And as you know, in the construction of a liquefaction -- excuse me, Jeff liquefaction plant is a 4- to 5-year event. So certain decisions will continue to be made based on assumptions of export licenses being awarded down the stretch, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Right. And then just shifting on NATI real quick. Certainly suspect that your synergies initially laid out were somewhat conservative. But I wonder if you could address the 3-year versus the 5-year. So kind of the underlying cost synergies, I'm not surprised they're going up. I think part of the reason that you talked about 5 years was really treading carefully on salesforce, R&D organization and that sort of thing. So just give us your thoughts on where that is and maybe the cultural side of the integration, I guess, is the heart of the question. Lal Karsanbhai : Well, I will start with this, Jeff. We have a phenomenal management team by Ritu Fabre and a great integration team here at Emerson that works very closely with the business. The team spent a significant amount of time between signing and close to do the work so that we could hit the ground running. But of course, as you can imagine, this is a very large transaction. We bought this company because we believe it can grow and it can run better. And we wanted to have a degree of caution in how fast we could go, what we could accomplish. And to many degrees, we've been pleased with the degree of execution, the speed at which it's been done and the energy that the team has had around the effort, which then gave us confidence, not just to increase the number but to increase the time of execution -- to decrease the time of execution to 3 years. Ram, any color on that? Ram Krishnan : Yes, you said it. I think the team, as we both reviewed the plans, felt very, very good in the quality of the opportunities that we had identified, and there is a shared vision around, trying to get this done faster and moving the business along. And that's where we've been very pleasantly surprised, the cultural similarity between how we both think, the customer-centricity and how we apply the rules to do the synergy actions. I think there -- we feel very confident that we could move faster. And that's the reason we raised it, and we also believe we can get it done by the end of year 3. Jeff Sprague : Great, good luck. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So obviously, a lot of questions on NATI so far, National Instruments, I guess. You've obviously accelerated the time line for the synergies. As Jeff mentioned, you raised it by $20 million. But you kept the 31% margin targets. Just wondering if there's anything kind of offsetting the upside to cost synergies we should consider there? Mike Baughman : All right. Nigel, it's Mike. No, there's really on plan. And remember, that's five years out that we were talking about, 31%. We are on track. I think the important thing for the near term is that our expectation around that adjusted EBITDA margin will be that it's a little bit up year-over-year on down sales, reflecting the synergy actions. And moving forward, no, there's really no change to our longer-term expectation around the profitability of test and measurement. Nigel Coe : No, no. But the $20 million gives you an extra point of margin. So just wondering if there's anything to offset that. It doesn't sound like there is, but just that's the spirit of the question. Mike Baughman : There isn't. I mean at the... Nigel Coe : Yes, go ahead. Ram Krishnan : No, there isn't. There isn't necessarily anything we've identified to offset the $20 million. I mean the 31% margin targets 5 years out. I mean, obviously, what we are finding is good investment opportunities. And right now, we're focused on executing the synergies by year 3. If we find good investment opportunities, we'll make that because I think 31% is the target we've set, and we feel pretty comfortable getting there. But if the $185 million comes through with no additional investment opportunities, maybe the number goes up, but that applies your outnumber. Nigel Coe : Okay. No, that's fair. I know I'm being counting, but just this worth question. And then you had some extraordinarily strong growth numbers within ID. I mean the 28% within measurement analytics. It looks like it's just an easy comp. So just -- maybe just talk about that a little bit. But more importantly, there's a theory out there that the process and hybrid markets are on a lag of discrete. And therefore, the spot part we've seen in discrete automation right now is sort of like a precursor for what you might see six months down the road. So can you just maybe address that point? And just anything unusual or concerning that you're seeing? It doesn't sound like it, but certainly, just maybe address that concern out there. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, happy to, Nigel. I've been speaking and been asked about this for the last three quarters or so. And again, what we experienced in the quarter continues to be very consistent with our initial commentary. The drivers around process and hybrid are being supported by the secular macros that we've been discussing, whether it's energy security, affordability, nearshoring, sustainability to digital transformation. And I think those macro secular drivers are robust enough and secular in nature that they will go through a different type of cycle than we've seen historically. Secondly, we did not experience a boom and bust environment in the process space in over the last cycle. This is a much more moderated capital cycle that we experienced. So we don't have the overcapacity situations and the overbuild situations that we have typically experienced. There was much more discipline in the capital layouts by our customers. And that's a benefit as well. So our business continues to be very robust, obviously. We continue to have confidence in the order runs and in the execution through the year. Ram Krishnan : Yes. Just to answer the first part of your question, measurement solutions up 28%. That's a function of that the supply chains coming back in that business. If you remember, it was an easier comparison. Q1 of last year, we had significant challenges on the electronics front, which have alleviated. So our orders are up high single digits, sales up 28% driven by improving supply chain. So it's clearly a data point driven by weaker -- easier comparisons, I would say, with Q1 of last year. Nigel Coe : Right. That\u2019s perfect. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, everybody. Congrats on a good start. I wanted to back up a little bit when you talk about R&D transformation at test and measurement. What do you mean? Is it like an 80-20 type thing that you're going to refocusing? Or just -- I know they're -- those good folks at NATI always spend a lot of money. But was it generally unfocused, do you think? Or how do you guys think about it? Ram Krishnan : Yes. I think it's purely on prioritization of the projects. I think we've gone in with our management system on how do we focus on the critical few priorities that can move the needle from a growth perspective. I mean there's lots of opportunity. The beauty of what we're finding at NATI is a culture of innovation, plenty of opportunities across 4 very important market segments where we can move the needle, macros around those markets like EVs, ADAS and semiconductors that are supportive of strong innovation. But I think we're bringing some discipline into how do we prioritize, how do we look at where do these resources need to be in order to balance cost capabilities, particularly in software versus Austin, for example. And I think these are prudent moves that will allow us to drive more innovation at a better cost from an R&D as a percent of sales. Lal Karsanbhai : And I will just add, Scott, to that. I think a company like NI with the market position it has in the space and the legitimacy of its technology will always have a role in the research element of innovation. That's always going to be a responsibility that we have in the space to continue to move that needle forward. And we will, by all means, as we do in all our businesses, continue that. But having viable commercial programs is important. And that's where parking some cars and investing heavily in the ones that we believe and management believes will ultimately result in customer success is really important. So really good work and thoughtful work being done by the team here led by Ram, of course, and Ritu. Scott Davis : Helpful context. If we back up a little bit again, you cited the SAF win with DG Fuels. Can -- what is the scope when you classify something like a win like that? Are you talking full meters, valves? Is there controls? Is there -- is it kind of across a full suite of offering? Or is there more specific stuff that you target for those types of projects you would class as a win? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. No, this was a -- if you think about our -- the automation stack, this was pretty much across the entire stack, the final control elements, the muscle in the plant, the sensing elements that we use both flow, pressure level and temperature, the DeltaV control system and then the analytics packages alongside it. So this was a holistic full package, 100% Emerson win, which really proved out the value of the portfolio and how it all comes together at a customer site. Scott Davis : Helpful. Thank you. Congrats. I\u2019ll pass on. Operator : The next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Just wanted to circle back to the discussion around sort of process investments by the large customers, particularly in the sort of oil and gas and energy world. Because it does seem as if there's an understandably a clear effort on that part is sort of shovel more of their cash to shareholders, whether they're government in the Middle East or public shareholders in the West. So just wondered your thoughts, Lal, on the kind of sustainability of that high single-digit orders growth in process that you saw in Q1. Should we expect that to moderate over the next sort of 12 months or so? And does that then pull the backlog down with it? Or the book-to-bill was so high that the backlog can still grow with moderating orders? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. It's a great question, Julian. I just returned from the Middle East where our team spent -- India and the Middle East, so our team spent time with significant customers in Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Qatar. And I can tell you that the environment is very robust, predominantly around sustainability and energy transition, those 2 elements. And I think there's enough demand-driven activity that will give us confidence in the sustained mid-single-digit kind of exit rate on process on the total company orders at the end of the year. So at this point, we've been thinking and analyzing this now for about three quarters or so. But we haven't seen any kind of deceleration in the process, particularly in the spaces that you're asking about. As a matter of fact, we continue to see very disciplined spending, very intentional around core elements of automation that can differentiate production around reliability, efficiency, productivity, of course, and safety. And that hasn't waned yet. And I don't -- we don't foresee that as we go through the year. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Thank you. And then just a much more sort of near-term fiddly question. Just looking at the second quarter guide on Slide 10, so the EPS at the midpoint is going up maybe $0.02 sequentially from Q1 despite a decent revenue and volume increase sequentially. Partly, that's the test and measurement earnings falling sequentially. But just wondered if there was anything else like in the base business changing in terms of mix or something like that as you move from sort of Q1 to Q2. Mike Baughman : No, you hit it right with the test and measurement comment. And the leverage in the low to mid-40s coming through reflects no big change in mix or trajectory. So no, really nothing there on the Q2 guide. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Snyder of UBS. Please go ahead. Christopher Snyder : Thank you. I also wanted to ask on National Instruments. Q1 came in about $80 million above the guide. But you guys are now talking to a full year of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. All the commentary on the last call was $1.6 billion. So I guess, why that range following the beat? Is it just a rounding error? Or is National Instruments maybe turning a little bit slower than you thought previously? Thank you. Colleen Mettler : Yes. Chris, if you go back to November guide, that range has remained consistent. I think it was just a round in $1.6 billion that was being spoken about. Christopher Snyder : Yes, thank you. And then I just want to ask on margins. It's been a real bright spot for the company over the last couple of years. You guys beat the incremental guide again here in Q1. But I believe the full year guide on the incrementals was lower, I think, from -- to low to mid-40s from mid- to high despite the Q1 beat. Is there anything there on mix or something that we should be aware of? Thank you. Mike Baughman : Yes. Chris, the -- in the comments, we talked about the effect of foreign exchange. We changed assumption there, and it had a 1-point increase on FX, which comes into the leverage number with a much lower profitability attached to it. The drivers around leverage remain the same with volume and leverage and price/cost, and then we continue to drive the Emerson management process with cost reductions to offset inflation, so yes. But to answer your question specifically, the change in the guide was really solely attributed to that FX element. Christopher Snyder : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Look, there's been a lot of focus on the progress you're making on the cost synergies front in National Instruments. Can we talk a bit about expectations for revenue synergies? It might be too early, but just timing and size and where it might come from? Is it cross-selling? Are there new customers you've been opened up to? But just what's the expectation? Lal Karsanbhai : I'll let Ram add a little bit of color. But certainly, it's something that we're keenly working on. Obviously, the focus was on the commitment on cost. And we do believe alongside management that, that is a -- had been and is an evident opportunity. Having said that, we are -- I'm not going to suggest that we're 3 or maybe even 6 months away to come out publicly with some sales ideas, but we're certainly working on customer-specific ideas on sales synergies. Ram and I and Ritu have held a number of customer meetings jointly and thinking through opportunities that we have across the Emerson portfolio as it comes in with NI. Ram? Ram Krishnan : Yes. And just the 2 end markets are clearly going to be EV batteries where -- on a holistic basis where we play on the production automation and NI plays on the validation and test systems on the R&D side and then similarly in semiconductors, 2 markets where I think there's enough customer overlap and a joint capability that provides meaningful value to our customers from R&D through validation, through production is where we will see the opportunities. We're working it. We're not ready yet to commit and quantify the sales synergies, but these are certainly in focus, and we're working through the process. Deane Dray : Great. And then just second question, I joined a bit late, so I apologize if you've covered this, on China. A lot of anxiety about the macro there. It doesn't look like you're positioned in the areas that -- like real estate that are having the most pressure. But just what are the expectations? What are the opportunities over the near term? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. We grew high single digits in the quarter in China sales. We expect in that high -- mid- to high single digits for the year. Our business continues to be relatively robust, again, aligned, Deane, to those same macro secular drivers that we're seeing globally. It's no different in China. Perhaps the end markets are slightly different, specialty chemicals and a few other things. But our position is very strong. Our regionalization strategy has been very strong. And we expect to continue to win in China as we go through the year. Ram, anything? Ram Krishnan : Yes. No, you said it. I think in our core process hybrid business, power and chemical will drive the growth. I mean, obviously, what's not in the underlying numbers is test and measurement. Test and measurement is consistent with discrete. Off to a tougher start in China, but expecting a second half recovery, consistent with what we're seeing with the discrete business. Deane Dray : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O\u2019Dea: Hi, good morning. Just in terms of the remaining 9 months of the year and the guide, obviously off to a strong start. But organically, any change in how you're thinking about that versus 3 months ago? It seems like not much change in what's implied in the organic growth rate. If anything, I think the math would suggest the margins could have ticked down a touch. But I just want to make sure, is the message that the last 9 months of the year, no real change in kind of the organic side of the expectations? Lal Karsanbhai : No. We remain Joe, very positive on the environment. Obviously, we couple that with the strong execution by our teams. But in terms of the organic outlook, no change really. Joe O\u2019Dea: Okay. And then related to the strength in measurement and analytical, I understand some commentary on easier comps, but the stacks did improve sequentially. And so as it relates to supply chain, where are you on a normalization? You know, the orders up high single digits is a pretty encouraging number. Are you at a point now where there's still some pent-up backlog to ship out? Or do you view it as having gotten pretty close to more normalization at this point? Ram Krishnan : Yes, the supply chains have normalized. So in terms of our ability to procure electronics and load factories and drive production out of factories, we feel that's normalized. Now certainly, in the measurement and analytical business, there is some overdue backlog that will ship through Q2. The easier comparisons and our ability to ship that backlog is what drove the 28% in Q1. You'll see that in the measurement and analytical business. That's the last business normalizing from a supply chain perspective. But the demand environment for that business still remains very healthy with orders up in the high single digits. Joe O\u2019Dea: Got it. Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from Brett Linzey of Mizuho. Please go ahead. Brett Linzey : Hey, good morning. Thank you. Wanted to come back to the project funnel. I was hoping you might be able to give some color on the profitability of the growth platforms. And is there anything different or unique about the aftermarket or service attachment rates and the way those deals were structured and Emerson's wallet share there? Lal Karsanbhai : No, nothing really different. Look, the profitability certainly varies between MRO and project activity, but that's well known. I think you know that well. But in terms of the mix within the funnel, there's not really a significant difference between a growth platform and traditional project work there. Of course, we have a $150 billion installed base around the world. And with that, some of that is obtained through and managed through service contracts, a large portion of it, where we have commitments for replacement and maintenance with many of our global customers. And others are upgrades, activities and things of that sort. Brett Linzey : Okay. Great. And then just shifting to price/cost, I think the original guide was about 2 points. You had 2 points in the quarter. Has the expectation changed at all for the year? And then any movement on material or non-material inflation that is shifting expectations at all on the cost side? Ram Krishnan : No, price is 2 points in the quarter, 2 points for the year. We feel good, no change there. In terms of our net material inflation, I think we're seeing continued opportunities that we're driving on the direct material side. The logistics costs have come down. We don't see any impact in terms of inflation or it's de minimis from the dynamics around what's going on with -- in the Red Sea or the Panama Canal. So we see NMI or net material inflation continuing to improve as we go through the year. Brett Linzey : Okay, great. Appreciate the insights. Best of luck. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session, and the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Colleen Mettler, Vice President of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead. Colleen Mettler : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Emerson's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. This morning, I am joined by : President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; Chief Financial Officer, Mike Baughman; and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Please join me on Slide 2. This presentation may include forward-looking statements, which contain a degree of business risk and uncertainty. Please take time to read the safe harbor statement and note on the non-GAAP measures. I will now pass the call over to Emerson's President and CEO, Lal Karsanbhai, for his opening remarks. Surendralal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Colleen. Good morning. I'd like to begin by thanking the Emerson's global team for yet again delivering very strong operating results. It is a testament of the strength of our people, the culture we are building, the portfolio we have created and the value of the Emerson Management System. I would also like to thank the Emerson Board of Directors for your continued support of the management team and to our shareholders for the trust you place in us. The second quarter was characterized by strong operating performance, which exceeded our expectations. We continue to have confidence in the underlying market conditions, driven by demand in the process and hybrid markets, aligned with secular macro trends : energy security and affordability, sustainability, nearshoring and digital transformation. The P&L execution was nearly flawless in the quarter. Underlying sales grew 8%, operations leveraged at 54%, expanding EBITDA by 140 basis points to 26% and delivering 25% EPS growth and 32% free cash flow growth. 2024 is the year of execution with no major portfolio moves planned. And through the first half, we feel confident and have raised our outlook for the year. We are energized about the power of our differentiated automation portfolio. Our NI team, led by Ritu Favre, continues to drive the integration plan and have again accelerated cost-out activities in response to a slower-than-anticipated market recovery. We will now deliver $100 million of synergies in 2024. Further, I'm excited about David Baker's appointment as CFO of AspenTech. Dave is an experienced global automation CFO and a 27-year veteran of Emerson. He will bring a degree of structure, forecasting accuracy and work with Antonio Pietri to reinforce a diligent management process. Lastly, I remain excited about what we can accomplish at Emerson. Our technology stack, comprised of intelligent devices, control and software, is highly differentiated in the marketplace, delivering scaled value to our customers. Further, innovation is alive and well at Emerson. And we continue to stretch the boundaries of the possible in automation. Please turn to Slide 3. Emerson and our Board are committed to ongoing Board refreshment. And today, we have the privilege of announcing the newest member elected to our Board of Directors. Calvin Butler is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Exelon, the nation's largest utility company by customer count, and a member of its Board of Directors. As part of Exelon and its operating companies, Calvin has held senior management roles in executive management, operations, corporate affairs and regulatory and external affairs. He is a passionate advocate for community equity. And his unique expertise in reliable, clean and affordable energy solutions will benefit Emerson as we continue to enable the energy transition and decarbonization for our broad customer base. He also has a local connection as he was born and raised in St. Louis and graduated with a law degree from Washington University School of Law. Calvin will officially join our Board on August 1, 2024. This will expand Emerson's Board to 12 members, half of whom are women or people of color. Having the right skills represented on Emerson's Board is critical to our continued success. And we are excited to have Calvin join us. Please turn to Slide 4. The second quarter exceeded our expectations and strong results highlight our continued focus on execution. Sales, operating leverage and adjusted earnings all exceeded Q2 expectations. Stronger volumes were driven by outstanding operational performance and more backlog conversion than expected. Price/cost and business segment mix were also more favorable than expected. Orders in the first half met our low single-digit growth expectations with a book-to-bill greater than 1. For the first half, process and hybrid saw mid-single-digit growth while, as expected, discrete saw a decline of mid-single digit. The demand environment for process and hybrid markets remains favorable. Discrete Automation orders were down year-over-year on a tough comparison but were up sequentially low single digits. And we now expect their orders to turn positive in Q4, a quarter delayed from our original expectation. While not impacting underlying, Test & Measurement orders were softer than anticipated in Q2, down 15%. For the second half, we expect mid-single-digit underlying growth in orders and low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth for the full year, led by process and hybrid resilience with delayed discrete improvement. Test & Measurement continues to perform and delivered slightly better-than-expected Q2 results for both sales and earnings. The turn to positive orders in this business is now expected in the first half of 2025, 2 quarters delayed than our original expectation. We are seeing continued softness in transportation and semiconductor demand driven by constrained CapEx environment while aerospace and defense is expected to be positive due to continued strength in government research and defense spending. This extended downturn enables another acceleration of synergy actions. And we now expect to realize $100 million of synergies in 2024, up from our prior expectation of $80 million as we pull in additional actions that will begin this quarter that were in the plan for 2025. Our differentiated portfolio is driving value creation for our shareholders. While we remain cautious on the timing of a recovery in discrete end markets and were slightly impacted by AspenTech's latest guidance revision, Emerson's first half performance, stable process and hybrid demand and additional self-help actions provide confidence to increase our full year guidance. We are increasing our underlying sales guidance to 5.5% to 6.5% and raising our adjusted EPS expectations to $5.40 to $5.50. We will remain focused on execution and integration this year, leveraging our Emerson Management System. And we are energized as we look ahead at the strength of our new portfolio to deliver differentiated results. Our leading technology and exposure to secular growth markets paved the way for continued value creation. Please turn to Slide 5. Emerson's Q2 exceeded guidance in underlying sales and profitability. Underlying sales for the quarter grew 8% with our process and hybrid businesses again exceeding expectations and better backlog conversion than initially expected. Energy security and affordability and sustainability commitments drove strong performance in energy, LNG, chemical and power. Hybrid end market strength continued with life sciences project momentum in North America, Europe and Asia and robust metals and mining activity. Factory automation demand remained soft with continued weakness in China. Europe, Asia and the Middle East were particularly strong in the quarter with persistent strength in process markets, driven by energy transition and traditional energy markets. One noteworthy example is India, which has seen double-digit growth in 5 of the last 6 quarters, including this quarter, driven by broad economic expansion across multiple segments. Our growth platforms also continued to perform strongly, underlying sales up double digit in the quarter. Our profitability continues to reflect the strength of our new portfolio. Gross margin has significantly improved since we started our portfolio journey when I took over as CEO in 2021. Gross margins at that time were in the low 40s. And in this fiscal year, we expect to achieve gross margins over 50%, nearly a 1,000 basis point improvement. In Q2, gross margin was 52.2%, a 430 basis point improvement from the prior year. Operating leverage was 54%, stronger than our expected low to mid-40s, again due to stronger volumes and favorable price/cost and mix. Adjusted EPS also came in ahead of plan at $1.36, $0.10 above the top end of our guide and up 25% from 2023. Emerson generated free cash flow of $675 million, up 32% year-over-year. Mike Baughman will go through additional details on our results in a few slides. We are pleased with our Q2 performance and the persistent strength in our process and hybrid businesses, giving us additional confidence as we look to the rest of the year. Please turn to Slide 6. Our strategic project funnel continues to grow and now sits at $10.8 billion, up approximately $400 million from Q1, with our growth programs up by $300 million and representing nearly 2/3 of the funnel. The funnel growth is in line with the constructive CapEx environment for our process and hybrid customers. This also reflects our exposure to robust secular trends as the increase primarily came from projects supporting sustainability and decarbonization and energy security and affordability. In the second quarter, Emerson was awarded approximately $350 million of project content with the increase in traditional energy stemming from the award of several large offshore vessels in Brazil. Our growth programs continue to demonstrate success. And I want to highlight three key project wins. First, Emerson and AspenTech were awarded an automation pilot project for a large chemical company in China. This is an important synergy win as the customer is developing a pathway to software-driven autonomous operations. The multiyear agreement is an integrated solution for Emerson and AspenTech software that will provide high-fidelity hybrid models and control automation for optimizing process operations based on real-time production data to increase product yield and reduce energy consumption. This example showcases the unique ability of the integrated Emerson and AspenTech portfolio to provide differentiated solutions for our customers. In the energy transition space, Emerson was selected to support Shell's proposed Polaris carbon capture project in Canada. Polaris, subject to final investment decision by Shell, would capture CO2 from the refinery and chemical plant located at the Shell Energy & Chemicals Park in Scotford, Alberta. Emerson is providing much of our leading technology, including instruments and valves. And finally, Emerson was chosen to automate a $4 billion manufacturing complex being built in Indiana by a large U.S.-based life science customer. Emerson will provide our leading DeltaV control systems and software portfolio, including a 5-year subscription agreement for our DeltaV MES. Please turn to Slide 7. This is a transformative moment for the U.S. power industry as data centers are driving electricity demand increases not seen since the early 2000s. At the same time, power producers are retiring carbon-intensive assets in a drive to decarbonize their operations and investing in the resilience and optimization of the grid. The grid is also experiencing an unprecedented shift from the unidirectional grid of the past to a bidirectional intelligent grid of the future, which will be increasingly supported by intermittent power sources. There are multiple factors driving this generational increase in U.S. electricity demand. And data centers alone account for nearly 1/3 of all new U.S. electrical demand. AI data center racks consume significantly more power than traditional data centers with a search on ChatGPT consuming 6 to 10 times the power of a traditional search on Google. Hyperscalers are revising CapEx estimates upward and increasing annual CapEx significantly in 2024 and build their AI infrastructure. This is expected to continue for multiple years. The increase in demand is real. And it is happening today.  Utilities in key regions across the U.S. are revising low-growth estimates upward materially from recent years' estimates. Georgia Power issued a revised assessment in which projected load growth was 17 times greater than previously forecast, resulting in approximately 30% greater total winter peak demand for the 2030-2031 winter. Dominion Energy has been a key beneficiary of traditional data center growth and forecasting another tailwind for AI data centers more than doubling their 10-year average annual summer peak load growth from 2022. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation recently put out their annual 9-year growth forecast with new demand more than doubling from the prior year forecast. While Emerson does not have material content in data centers, Emerson is a key player in the power industry for generation, transmission and distribution, all of which are set to be beneficiaries. Approximately 9% of Emerson sales are in power. And while we have a strong portfolio across our technology stack, I want to highlight the software and control layer, which is relevant across the power landscape from generation to transmission and distribution. The Ovation automation platform and Ovation Green portfolio of renewable solutions are purpose-built for power generation greenfield builds and plant modernization applications. Together, our Ovation automation technology and Green solutions automate approximately 50% of North America and 20% of global power generation. Emerson's strategic project funnel in power is up 45% year-over-year, reflecting the emerging potential. And I'd like to mention a key win from the quarter. Emerson was selected by a large Midwest utility to modernize nine sites with the latest Ovation hardware, software and cybersecurity solutions. We were awarded based on our demonstrated ability to execute plant modernizations while ensuring safety, quality and reliability, all vitally important in the power industry. With the increasing mix of generation sources and rise of distributed resources and microgrids, utilities must now also manage the integration of varying and bidirectional power flows. AspenTech's Digital Grid Management, or DGM, software also plays a critical role in managing the ever-increasing complexity of today's grid to maintain stability and control through real-time power management and demand-side management software. DGM is a strong participant in these markets with approximately 40% share in North America and approximately 20% globally. The necessity of grid digitalization is driving investments in the advanced capabilities that software provides with the market forecasted to grow in the high-teens. Emerson's leading products and application expertise across the power landscape make us well positioned to capture the coming investments both in the U.S. and globally. And we are excited to watch the future of power generation, transmission and distribution unfold. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike Baughman. Michael Baughman : Thanks, Lal, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8 to discuss our second quarter financial results. Underlying sales growth was 8%, led by our process and hybrid businesses. Price contributed approximately 3 points of growth, slightly higher than expected due to the mix of our shipments this quarter. Growth was led by Europe, which was up 12%, and Asia, Middle East and Africa, up 11%. The Americas also had solid growth, up 4%. Intelligent Devices and Software and Control grew by 6% and 14%, respectively. AspenTech sales increased significantly over the prior year, up 21% on an underlying basis. Discrete Automation was down mid-single digits as expected due to continued market softness and against a tough prior year comp. Test & Measurement, which is not included in the underlying measure, contributed $367 million to our net sales, exceeding expectations for the quarter on stronger backlog conversion. Backlog was essentially flat to the prior quarter at $7.55 billion. Adjusted segment EBITDA margin improved 140 basis points to 26%. And as Lal mentioned, gross profit margins of 52.2% contributed to this margin expansion. Leverage on volume, favorable mix, price, net material deflation and productivity programs all contributed to the margin improvement. Operating leverage, excluding Test & Measurement, was 54%, exceeding expectations. Test & Measurement adjusted segment EBITDA margin was 21.4%, above expectations, driven by leverage on slightly higher sales volume, mix and higher cost actions. Adjusted earnings per share grew 25% to $1.36. And I will discuss additional details on adjusted EPS on the next chart. Lastly, free cash flow improved 32% to $675 million, exceeding expectations, driven by earnings and improved inventory levels. Acquisition-related costs, integration activities and higher CapEx reduced the quarter's free cash flow by approximately $70 million. Please turn to Slide 9. Adjusted EPS growth of $0.27 was driven entirely by operations as other nonoperating items netted to 0. Software and Control led the growth, contributing $0.18, and Intelligent Devices contributed $0.09. Overall, adjusted EPS grew 25% year-on-year to $1.36. Please turn to Slide 10 for details on our updated guidance for Q3 and 2024. Underlying sales are now expected to grow 5.5% to 6.5%, which raises the bottom of our February range. Our process and hybrid businesses are performing well and support the outlook for the rest of the year. We still expect underlying sales of our Discrete Automation segment to turn positive in Q4. And we are watching the orders progression, which we believe is now delayed by 1 quarter. Reported net sales growth is expected to be 15% to 16% with Test & Measurement contributing approximately 10 points of growth or approximately $1.5 billion in sales, the low end of the February guide, offset by a 0.5 point drag from FX. Incremental margins are held at low to mid-40s, which suggests mid-30s incrementals for the second half. The second half will see a change in mix with higher project-related shipments and changes in segment and geographic mix. Adjusted EPS has increased to $5.40 to $5.50. Test & Measurement is still expected to contribute $0.40 to $0.45 as we accelerate synergy activities. We now expect to have $100 million of synergies realized this year. AspenTech lowered their guidance yesterday afternoon. And we have incorporated the latest revisions into our guide. We now expect AspenTech to deliver $0.30 to $0.32 for the year versus the $0.32 to $0.34 in our February guidance. Free cash flow performance in the first half of the year and our updated earnings projections support free cash flow for the year of approximately $2.7 billion. Share repurchase, dividend and tax rate expectations are unchanged from February. For the third quarter, we expect underlying sales growth between 3% and 4.5% and leverage in the mid-30s due to the project and geographic mix I described earlier. Adjusted earnings per share is expected at $1.38 to $1.42. And finally, Test & Measurement sales and earnings per share contribution is expected to be at similar levels we saw in quarter 2 as we watch orders carefully. Our first half performance exceeded expectations, and we are excited to continue delivering strong results. Our transformed portfolio is meaningfully improved with higher profitability driven by gross profit margins above 50% and higher organic sales growth driven by secular trends. And our Emerson Management System continues to drive operational excellence. With that, I'll turn it over to the Q&A portion of our call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Davis, Scott, Melius Research. Scott Davis : A lot of good detail in the slides. But I wanted to start with just a sense of the synergies that you're seeing and just get a little bit more color on what you're getting as far as structural cost-out, what may have to come back when revenues recover and how we might think about what really that asset looks like in kind of a more normalized situation from a profit perspective. Surendralal Karsanbhai : Yes, Scott. I'll say a few words and let Ram add some color to this. First and foremost, we're very excited about the company. It's a far better company than we expected in terms of the quality of people, the quality of the technology, the loyalty of the customer base and the opportunity to grow and expand as a leader in the industry. So we're very pleased. We have a great management team in place. And we're most pleased about is the responsiveness of that management team to the market conditions. This is now being run as an Emerson company. And they've gotten ahead of the activities around cost takeout in a very diligent way, this was all laid out prior to close with the teams. So we're essentially working down a playbook. We've now moved into some of the actions, as I referenced, that were outlined for 2025 that have been moved forward. But none of these are elements that we believe we necessarily have to add back. This is really driving around efficiency in the company and position it to the SG&A structure to be more competitive, a little leaner on a go-forward basis. Ram, if you don't mind? Ram Krishnan : Yes. And just to add to that, I think the balanced approach around G&A, the optimization of the go-to-market, optimizing and focusing the R&D efforts on critical growth vectors that are going to pay a lot of benefit for us as the market recovers. And that's really what we've been focused on. Obviously, we are seeing opportunities in logistics and supply chain, which is additional to what we had originally planned.  But net-net, the $185 million we've committed to is a programmatic approach that is divided across these 4 segments. And we've been able to accelerate these actions just given the environment we're in, mostly because they were all well planned out and we are able to pull forward these initiatives, given that they've been thought out and the teams are actioning them at a rapid pace. Scott Davis : That's helpful. Guys, I'm looking at Slide 7 at the DGM and the Ovation. And give us a sense of how this upgrade cycle works. The power demand, obviously, and grid, I think we're all quite aware of what's going there. But does it require -- and I mean, maybe just a little bit more color on how these two, DGM and Ovation, kind of -- do they integrate? Do they sell together? Is there any way to kind of get more benefit, I guess, from having the two assets versus the one? And it's a little bit of an open-ended question. I'm just trying to get a sense of the materiality in the upgrade cycle here. But maybe the best way to start with that is just to understand if those assets actually can integrate and work together and if that's a benefit to the utility. Surendralal Karsanbhai : Yes. No, certainly would be happy to comment. I think there's three very important elements. I think element of materiality relates to the high growth in the outlook of projects and activity. We saw that 45% expansion in the funnel. We haven't seen that level of activity in power generation in a long time with a positive growth in North America again driven by the data center demand that we outlined. Secondly, inside of the generation capacity, there certainly are opportunities for optimization software. That is an area that really is untapped. And that's a synergy opportunity that exists between Ovation and AspenTech. And then thirdly, certainly, the leverage of a strength in our utilities, the customer base, takes us outside the walls of the plants into the transmission and distribution. And even though there are not technology synergies between DGM and Ovation per se, there certainly are significant customer synergies and credibility that has been built with Ovation that takes us into the transmission/distribution software. Operator : The next question is from Coe, Nigel of Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : So just wanted to dig into the operating leverage assumptions in the back half of the year. I think you said mid-30s on sort of mix changing. And I think we've had this MRO mix now of 65% or so for the last couple of years. Are we starting to see that mix changing notably in the back half, maybe getting towards maybe, I don't know, 60% MRO? And does this -- do you expect this to continue in 2025? It feels like it should be. But do you think 2025 is more like a mid-30s? Or do you still think you can maintain 40%-plus operating leverage in 2025? Michael Baughman : Yes. Nigel, it's Mike. So as we look to the back half of the year, the mix change is meaningful. And you're correct, we've been at the 65% MRO, which is about where we were for the second quarter as well. That is going to drift down on us as we go into the second half. We also benefited this past quarter quite a bit from price. We'll continue to get the roughly 2% price, but it won't be the 3%, we don't believe, that we saw in the last quarter. So those are the big things. There's also a geographic mix element to this with the U.S. growth moderating relative to other geographies. And then if you start to think about the 54% that we printed this quarter versus what we're expecting in the second quarter, there was an uplift this quarter from AspenTech, which had a great quarter, that will moderate in the back half of the year. So you need to put that into your thinking as you go forward as well. Nigel Coe : Okay. I'm guessing no comments on '25. But if you do think that continues, I'd appreciate that comment. But on National Instruments, it just feels like -- so just to paraphrase the way you've set this up for the second half, third quarter looks pretty flat sequentially on sales, call it, $360-ish million of sales and then we're picking up towards $400 million in the fourth quarter. I just want to verify that, that pickup in the fourth quarter is entirely seasonal. I think when you go back in time, we typically see that coming through in that quarter. So it doesn't feel like we're taking a huge cycle call there. And then with the synergies, do we expect the margins to continue to move higher sequentially through the back half of the year? Ram Krishnan : Yes. I think you summarized it well. Yes, sequentially, margins would be up, correct. And to your '25 question, I mean, it's early for us to plan '25. But at the end of the day, we don't expect leverage rates in '25 to be materially different from what we're going to deliver in '24. Operator : The next question is from Andy Kaplowitz, Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Well, I know you're still expecting mid-single-digit order growth in the second half after the negative 1% in Q2. So maybe you could discuss how you start off Q3 in April. Give us a little more color into visibility regarding that mid-single-digit growth in the second half. Do you have visibility in the process and hybrid staying at that mid-single-digit level? And then is the mid-single-digit organic growth kind of weighted to Q4, given the turn in discrete then? Surendralal Karsanbhai : Yes. Certainly, Andy. Look, we're off to a good start in Q3. April over April of last year is up double digit, 10%, on orders. Certainly -- and the 3 months has turned positive as well. So we flipped that to the low single digits on a 3-month basis, trailing 3-month basis. So feel good about the start, feel good about the funnel and the conversion and the markets. And it's again driven by the process and hybrid environment across most of the world areas.  Discrete, we're watching very carefully. As we said, we expect that to turn now a quarter later than originally expected. But we're seeing green shoots that started developing in March and into April, particularly in Western Europe, in Germany around machine makers and some of the discrete industries. So optimistic start for the quarter, again gave us the confidence as we tested our businesses and worked out process that exiting the year in that mid-single digit, low single-digit type of range on orders is very, very feasible. Andrew Kaplowitz : Lal, just a quick follow-up to that last comment. Did you just get a couple of larger projects in April? Is that kind of what happened to swing that? Surendralal Karsanbhai : No, no, no. There's funnel conversion, Andy, but nothing exemplary there. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay. And then maybe what are your customers telling you on the NATI side as to sort of why the recovery is still delayed there? And if NATI is still slower to turn than you currently expect, do you still have more flexibility to sort of continue to push the envelope on integration cost-out? And then ultimately, I know Ram said you're still targeting the $185 million. But could you do more than that? Surendralal Karsanbhai : No, certainly. Look, I think the team has a great set of ideas on their walls in terms of opportunities to drive efficiency and productivity in the business. But we believe that ultimately, this is a growth business. And while we're doing this, we're driving investments in core technology programs so that we hit the ground running. We're working on customer demand, both Ram and myself, alongside the management team at National Instruments is well engaged with the customers. Ram will actually speak at NI Connect in a couple of weeks, along with Ritu, which will be a pivotal moment for us. And we have a very successful event in Dallas, I believe, with Ram this year. So look, we're very excited about the potential in the business and this business turning positive in early 2025. Ram, a few words? Ram Krishnan : Yes. And I think to answer your specific question as it relates to customer, what we're hearing from customers, certainly segments like the defense segment, or what they call aerospace, defense and government segment, are positive. I think we're going to get into easier comparisons. Frankly, April was also a very good month for -- given the expectations for T&M, which was positive for us.  And I think really the only two segments we haven't seen the turn, which is why we believe it's at least 1 to 2 quarter delayed in T&M, is semiconductors and Asia. North America actually turned positive in April. Europe has turned positive. We feel good about the ADG segment. And we're cautiously optimistic about transportation. But the portfolio segment, particularly driven by Asia, and then semiconductors is where we still have to see recovery. We're watching that very carefully. Operator : The next question is from Deane Dray, RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : This came up a couple of times in the prepared remarks, and maybe just if you could walk us through what's different. But you said that there was better backlog conversion than expected. So is this on -- because of a customer request, they want it earlier, that you were able to have better productivity or throughput? Just how did that differ from what the original plan was on the backlog conversion? Ram Krishnan : Yes. So Deane, simplistically, responsive supply chains. We had -- our supply chains continued to improve, our plant output has continued to improve, particularly in our measurement solutions business. There was backlog conversion in Test & Measurement as well. So the simple answer is we overshipped what we thought we would in the quarter primarily because our supply chains responded much better and lead times are down to pre-COVID levels, which is a very good sign for us. Michael Baughman : Sorry, Deane, just to build on that a little bit, relatedly, those being two higher GP businesses helps the profitability in the quarter as well. Deane Dray : Yes, it tells you how far we've progressed on supply chain normalization, where that wasn't the first thing I'm thinking that you were able to ship more. So that's all good news. And then just a follow-up on the Test & Measurement, NATI, on the orders visibility, is there maybe some color on the demand and whether -- did you miss any orders? Was the demand out there and you missed orders? Or is the demand not there? Are you engaged in any more selectivity? Just some color there would be helpful. Ram Krishnan : No, we did not miss any orders. I think orders came in as per expectations. And I think the way we've actually baked in the plan is even if orders stayed flat to slight sequential growth from what we did in Q2, given the easier comparisons, will improve in the second half and then go positive into '25. Certainly, as Lal mentioned, the green shoots in the defense part of their business, we've been very strong. We're starting to see projects unlock on the battery testing side from an EV perspective. So we're starting to see activity come through. Again, the one segment which hasn't seen the recovery, which typically we play in, RF and mixed signal in semiconductors. The memory and the logic piece is not a big piece of our business. We expect that to come back first followed by the activity in RF and mixed signal chip testing. So that recovery is really what's pushed out by 6 months. But outside of that, everything is coming in as expected. Operator : The next question is from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : So I'm just trying to kind of calibrate the second half a little better. I think you guys, typically from a seasonal perspective, more or less accelerate sequentially as you move through the year. This year seems like it's a bit more kind of flat just from a quarter-to-quarter sales perspective and then with much less of a ramp from 3Q to 4Q. Anything on the top line seasonally that is not as -- is not normal, is a little slower than usual on the core business, outside of NATI and outside of Aspen? Ram Krishnan : No, actually -- and the way I see it is our second half versus first half will be up high single digits sequentially from a sales perspective. So it is consistent with the normal seasonality of how our core business minus NATI, minus Aspen performs. Now obviously, Aspen is lumpy and that's in the underlying number. So that could mask the normal seasonality that we see. But in the core base Emerson operations, the second half to first half is up high single digits sequentially from a sales perspective. C. Stephen Tusa : And I guess, given the mix of MRO is so high today and the growth really isn't that strong, is the mix really changing that much? I mean, is the -- how much is the kind of lower-margin project stuff going to be up in the second half more than MRO, you know what I mean? Like can this change that much quarter-to-quarter? Surendralal Karsanbhai : No, Steve, it doesn't. So look, we were at 65% in 2023. In Q2, we're at 64%. So there was 1 point shift. That may move yet another point as we go through the year. But no, you're right. And the underlying strength of MRO in our process and hybrid business is still intact. And as certainly we go through the summer and approach the fall outages and STOs and turnaround opportunities, we look at, at least from this point in time, rather positively as well. So that's what's going to play into this as we go through the second half and, hence, gives us confidence also on that exit rate on orders for the year. C. Stephen Tusa : And then just one last one on NATI, I don't -- I haven't done the math on this 3Q guide. But is that down sequentially and then up sequentially in the fourth quarter? It looks to me like the revenue run rate now, at least for the second half versus 2Q, is basically flattish at around $370 million or something like that. Is that the right construct for NATI in the second half? Ram Krishnan : So flat Q3, sequentially up in Q4. C. Stephen Tusa : Yes. So it's bottomed, the revenues have bottomed there? Ram Krishnan : Yes. Operator : The next question is from Joe O'Dea, Wells Fargo. Joseph O'Dea: Can you dig in a little bit on the growth trends in Measurement & Analytical and Final Control? I mean, it seems like Measurement & Analytical organic, low double digits, maybe even touch low-teens this year, Final Control, mid-single digits. Just some of the differences in those growth rates, what you're seeing on the measurement side versus what you're seeing on the Final Control side. Ram Krishnan : So measurement solutions this year, you're spot on there, it's going to grow faster than Final Control primarily because that was the business that suffered the most from our backlog build due to lead times. Those -- that backlog is coming down. So the delta in growth rates between Final Control and measurement solutions from a sales perspective is purely that backlog dynamic. Order rates for both businesses, which is a signal of the underlying demand with both businesses being exposed to process and hybrid markets, relatively the same, mid- to high single digits. Joseph O'Dea: Got it. And then it looks like on AspenTech, the fourth quarter EBITDA is implied down something in the neighborhood of kind of $20 million year-over-year. Is that more revenue-related, margin-related, just to understand kind of line of sight into that if that's sort of ballpark what we're looking at? Ram Krishnan : Yes. So ballpark, that's what we're looking at. It is lumpy, given the ASC 606. And we'll continue to work the Aspen fourth quarter. But at this point, yes, it's forecasted to be down from Q3. Operator : The next question is from Brett Linzey, Mizuho. Brett Linzey : Wanted to come back to the power franchise. So I imagine there's an opportunity on the newbuild but also the retrofits on the installed base as some of these LTSAs expire with some of your peers out there. Is there a way to frame the content per unit or megawatt? And then any runway on some of the retrofits? Surendralal Karsanbhai : Yes, we'll give you some perspectives and some guidelines. On a 1,200-megawatt combined cycle plant, the project opportunity, or KOB1 opportunity, is approximately $20 million. It's $5 million in the control system, approximately $15 million of instrumentation and valves. The lifetime MRO opportunity over a decade is another $20 million of upgrades. And that lives through about a 10-year period. So it's very significant. And you can just calculate then off the megawatts, depending on the size of the plant.  So certainly, there are upgrade opportunities. That's what -- a lot of what we're seeing in the revamps. We see also on the nuclear side, extension of plant life, which is very meaningful for us, not just from an Ovation perspective with Westinghouse but certainly from an instrumentation perspective and valve perspective. So all dynamics in the global power market are pointing very positive right now. Brett Linzey : Very helpful. And then just on inventory levels, I know your channel dynamics are a little bit different than peers, but maybe you could just frame where you see inventories in some of those sort of channels. And specifically at machine builders, inventory levels, I think, are a bit elevated. But just curious what your assessment and characterization is for the near term here. Ram Krishnan : Yes. For our discrete business, our Discrete Automation business, I think inventory levels have certainly normalized in the channel. So we see no dynamics around that. The Test & Measurement business at NI, there is still some elevated levels of inventory in our portfolio business-related channel partners' distribution that should bleed out over the next quarter, which will be helpful for order rates in the portfolio business to turn. But net-net, we don't see any major dynamics around channel inventory that would impact our orders momentum. Operator : The next question is from Julian Mitchell, Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just wanted to start off with the Discrete Automation business. Ram, you touched on the inventories at some of the customer levels just now being normal. So when we think about your discrete business, is it in the third quarter sort of flattish sales, down a little bit year-on-year and in the fourth quarter in discrete, you're up year-on-year and sequentially? Is that the recovery slope? Ram Krishnan : Yes, sir. Yes, quarter-over-quarter, flat in Q3, slightly positive in Q4 is kind of how we're looking at orders. We saw a recovery in the fourth quarter, correct. And then for Test & Measurement, which is also exposed to the discrete markets but a different type of discrete market exposure, recovery into the first half of '25 primarily because of the heavy play in semicon and a bigger portfolio of business in China. Two of those markets are seeing slower recovery than our broader Discrete Automation business within the core Emerson. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. And maybe just on the Aspen side of things, Lal, you'd mentioned the CFO change and reiterated there's no big portfolio actions at Emerson this year. Maybe just characterize sort of with Aspen in general, how you're thinking about your discussions with them on their capital deployment plans. I've seen they've continued to do the share buybacks. And when you look a little bit further out beyond this year, the appetite on kind of software acquisitions, please? Surendralal Karsanbhai : No, sure. No, first, very -- continue to be very excited about the partnership that we have with AspenTech. I do believe, Julian, that together, we have a highly differentiated tech stack that we bring to the customer base. And I think that's been highly substantiated by the synergy wins, the level of customer engagements that both Antonio and I have around the world. And we continue to believe in the premise that 1 plus 1 equals 3 here.  In terms of the CFO, rightfully, I think you said it right, I'm excited from a perspective of the processes and structure that can be brought in. I think there will be a really good working relationship between Antonio and David Baker. And he brings a lot of the Emerson Management System into AspenTech with him, which we believe is important from an operating perspective.  And then lastly, look, no, no comment on the go-forward. We're going to operate the structure as is, keeping in mind, Julian, that we're only in the second year of this journey. And we believe that there's value to be created out there in the structure. So for now, no change. Operator : And the last question is from Andrew Obin, Bank of America. David Ridley-Lane: This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin. Just wanted to circle back, I know that there was some pull-forward of orders last quarter. How does that -- if you kind of normalized your first quarter and second quarter for that, what did that trend look like? And just to put a little finer point on it, should we be expecting low single-digit orders growth in the third quarter before stepping up in the fourth? Ram Krishnan : Yes. So we were plus 4% in Q1, down 1% in Q2. So low single digits for the first half, greater than 1 book-to-bill. And then in the second half, you are right, low single digits in the third quarter and arguably, the fourth quarter which is, at this point, baked in better than the third quarter. Let's put it that way. David Ridley-Lane: Got it. And then on the sustainability and decarbonization project funnel, I know that's nearly doubled over the last 18 months. Are these projects kind of getting closer and closer to final investment decisions, kind of like the carbon capture when you cited with Shell this quarter? Ram Krishnan : Yes. I mean, in certain segments like biofuels and carbon capture, the hydrogen projects, which are large, are probably slower movement through the funnel. But I think we see considerable activity globally, certainly big in Europe, here in North America as well. But the pace of progression of these projects through the funnel is varied depending on the segment. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to the management for any closing remarks. Colleen Mettler : Thanks so much for joining the call today, and we look forward to callbacks later this afternoon. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I am moved by our customer focus and the deep care you have for each other, and I am proud and honored to work alongside each of you. Thank you to the Board of Directors for your support of the management team and to our shareholders for your trust in us. Since I became CEO in 2021, we have talked openly about the transformation of Emerson driven around the three pillars of culture, portfolio and execution. We have moved rapidly to improve across all three. And before we discuss the quarterly financial results, I want to highlight the results of our latest employee survey to show our employees are with us on this journey as our culture continues to evolve. Our latest company-wide engagement survey, inclusive of Test & Measurement had a participation rate of 89%, up 1.4 points from our 2023 survey. We had an engagement score of 79%, a 1-point improvement and only 1 point from world-class levels of 80%. While this is an evergreen journey, and we still have work to do, I am excited about the tangible steps we have taken to create a more inclusive and engaged organization. Now let's jump into the operating results. Q3 was another solid quarter for Emerson. Orders in the quarter returned to growth and were up 3% year-over-year, driven by strong project activity in our Process and Hybrid businesses, especially across life sciences, energy and power. Notably, we won several large life science projects in North America and Europe focused on expanding production capabilities for advanced medicines. The Middle East and Latin America saw exceptional demand, and we were awarded several large projects in each. As we expected, Process and Hybrid markets remained steady at mid-single-digit growth as we continue to see investments, particularly in LNG, life sciences, energy and sustainability. While capital project investments continue to progress, MRO orders were slightly softer than expected in the quarter. Discrete Automation orders were softer than expected, down low single digits both year-over-year and sequentially as factory automation end markets remained weak. The green shoots we were beginning to see through April and May took a step back in June, and we are now expecting a slower recovery, though we expect Discrete Automation orders to be flat to slightly positive in Q4 on a low base of comparison. Excluded from underlying, Test & Measurement orders remained soft, down 11%. Additionally, for total Emerson, we saw a weaker demand environment in China across most of our business segments. We now expect low single-digit underlying order growth for the second half and for the full year. Emerson delivered strong operating results with margin leverage, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow all exceeding expectations. Sales came in at the low end of our guide, and I'll provide additional color on the next slide. Due to weaker orders, Test & Measurement sales also came in slightly below expectations. However, profitability met expectations as we are seeing the impact of our synergy realization. Transportation and semiconductor markets remain weak, while aerospace and defense performed well, and we saw continued government spending and research. The European market was softer than expected amid lingering EV demand concerns, and China remains sluggish across most Test & Measurement segments. Due to this, we are looking into second half of 2025 for recovery in this business. With softer orders, we are adjusting our full year sales to be $1.45 billion to $1.5 billion, but the accelerated synergy actions we have taken will help protect profitability and position the business well for a return to growth. We continue to be excited about the value creation potential of our differentiated portfolio. Emerson's strong performance through the first 9 months and resolute focus driven by our Emerson management system gives us the confidence to execute on our 2024 plan. We expect underlying sales of approximately 6% and are increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guide to $5.45 to $5.50 and we are raising our free cash flow guidance to approximately $2.8 billion. We look forward to a strong finish to 2024 and are energized to deliver continued value creation for our shareholders. Please turn to Slide 4. Underlying sales growth was 3%. Life sciences and power markets continue to perform well, both up double digit as we executed key projects across North America and Europe. Europe is seeing continued strength in energy, power and sustainability markets as well as our MRO business, particularly in Western Europe. In the Americas, broad-based healthy growth across Latin America was slightly offset by slower MRO in North America. Robust performance in the Middle East, driven by strong project activity was offset by broad-based weakness in Asia. Continuing the exceptional gross margin performance from last quarter, gross margins were 52.8% in Q3, a 230 basis point improvement from the prior year. Our gross profit percentage year-to-date is 50.6%, even with the acquisition and integration costs incurred in Q1. This gives us confidence in our expectation that this portfolio will deliver greater than 50% gross margins as we look forward. Operating leverage was 67%, significantly stronger than expected due to better performance from AspenTech, project mix and realization of more cost reductions than expected from actions taken throughout the year. Adjusted earnings per share exceeded expectations at $1.43, above the top end of our guide and up 11% from 2023. Emerson generated robust free cash flow of $975 million, up 27% year-over-year and with a free cash flow margin of 22.3% for the quarter. Mike will walk through additional details on our results in a few slides. We are pleased to deliver another strong quarter and are excited to continue demonstrating the value creation potential of our transformed portfolio. Please turn to Slide 5. We continue to see strong capital project investments with our strategic project funnel now at $11 billion, up approximately $200 million from Q2. The funnel growth demonstrates the strong sustained capital cycle aligned to our growth programs. As the increase predominantly came from projects supporting energy transition, life sciences, sustainability and decarbonization. In the third quarter, Emerson was awarded approximately $350 million of project content, consistent with prior quarters. We had wins in large traditional energy projects as well as additional awards from offshore vessels in Brazil, as mentioned last quarter. Our growth programs also performed well in the quarter, accounting for a little under half of the awards, and I want to highlight a few key wins. Emerson was selected to automate Nemaska Lithium Whabouchi Mine at the B\u00e9cancour lithium conversion facility projects in Quebec, Canada. Based on our proven ability to provide a differentiated solution, including a common control platform across sites. This mine is one of the largest high-purity lithium deposits in North America. Fueled by hydroelectric power, the B\u00e9cancour facility will convert to spodumene concentrate to lithium hydroxide. This is the first such conversion in Canada and Nemaska Lithium projects will play an important role in the North America battery value chain. Emerson will provide much of our leading technology to automate both facilities, including DeltaV control systems and software, reliability solutions, valves and instruments. This example highlights the breadth of the Emerson portfolio and demonstrates how we are well suited to serve this emerging market. Next, I'd like to highlight Emerson was selected to support one of the largest renewable energy park projects in India, spearheaded by one of India's largest and most prominent renewable energy companies. Emerson will provide our Ovation Green SCADA solution, including pitch control and park power management for the wind turbines. Emerson was chosen for our scalable automation software and technologies that enhance wind turbine performance as well as our comprehensive local support capabilities, including engineering, fuel support and production. Finally, Emerson was chosen to automate a key green hydrogen project in Uzbekistan, which will use a 52-megawatt onshore wind farm to produce 3,000 tons of green hydrogen annually, which will be used to manufacture 500,000 tons of ammonia fertilizer. ACWA Power, a first mover on green hydrogen and part of the NEOM Green Hydrogen project will operate the plant and H-TEC [ph] will design and construct the facility. Emerson was selected for our advanced technologies and domain expertise and will provide several technologies from our hydrogen portfolio, including instruments, control valves and our Ovation Green control system. Turning to Slide 6. We remain focused on driving our strategic priorities, including accelerating innovation for profitable growth and enhancing our position as a global leader in automation. One of our breakthrough innovation priorities is software-defined automation. Our industry-leading Ovation Automation platform just launched a software-defined AI-ready platform for the power and water industries. The Ovation Automation Platform 4.0 builds upon our boundless automation vision to bring a unifying data fabric across the organizations to optimize operations from device to enterprise. Ovation 4.0 brings customer-focused innovation, such as secure generative AI models to offer prescriptive operations and maintenance guidance together in a robust solutions portfolio. It also offers integration with our Ovation Green software to improve holistic awareness across traditional and renewable power generation and storage to aid customers who have an increasingly complex mix of generating assets. Customer-focused innovation is a hallmark of Emerson, and I wanted to highlight one of the key methods we have for formal engagements. Our Ovation business recently held their 37th Users Conference in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with 70% of U.S. power utilities participating in a multi-day event focused on the power and water industries. This conference featured interactive technology exhibits, customer case studies and collaborative industry sessions focused on emerging technical and business topics. Ovation Users Group creates a world-class engagement as users provide direct input for potential product enhancements, which helps inform our strategic product development plans. We also took a key step forward in our transformation and simplification journey in Q3 as we announced a definitive agreement to sell our remaining interest in the Copeland joint venture. Private equity funds managed by Blackstone will purchase the equity stake, while Copeland repurchased the sellers note. The transaction involving the Copeland note receivable closed on August 2, with pretax cash proceeds of $1.9 billion, which will be used to pay down debt. We expect the equity portion to close by the end of August. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mike Baughman to walk through our financial results in more detail. Mike Baughman : Thanks, Lal, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 7 to discuss our third quarter financial results. Underlying sales growth was 3%, led by our Process and Hybrid businesses and partially offset by continued softness in discrete. Price contributed 2 points of growth. Underlying growth was similar across regions, with Europe up 4%, the Americas, up 3% and Asia and the Middle East, up 2%. Intelligent Devices grew 2%, while software and control grew 7%. AspenTech sales were stronger than expected, growing at 7%. Discrete Automation was down mid-single digits, lower than expected due to a slower pace of recovery amidst continued market weakness. Test and Measurement, which is not included in the underlying metric contributed $355 million to our net sales, slightly below expectations for the quarter. As expected, backlog decreased slightly from Q2 and exited Q3 at $7.4 billion. Adjusted segment EBITDA margin improved 20 basis points to 27.1% due to strong gross margin performance, favorable price cost and the benefit of cost reductions. This quarter's adjusted segment EBITDA margin of 27.1% is a record high compared to 26.9% last year in Q3, which was the previous record high. Test and Measurement adjusted segment EBITDA margin was 21.4%, sequentially flat on slightly lower volume as we continue to see the benefit of our synergy actions. Operating leverage, excluding Test and Measurement was 67%, exceeding expectations. This outperformance was driven by a higher portion of software revenue and fewer lower margin project shipments than expected, offset by negative geographic mix. Strong quarters from AspenTech and Control Systems and Software benefited leverage. Discrete Automation had sequential margin improvement from cost actions we took as we saw market conditions continue to decline. The operating leverage from our measurement and analytical business was dilutive in the quarter, primarily due to geographic mix and slower MRO. Adjusted earnings per share grew 11% to $1.43, and I will discuss that in more depth on the next chart. Finally, free cash flow was $975 million, up 27% versus the prior year and above expectations. This was driven by earnings and improvements in working capital, especially in inventory and receivables. Free cash flow margin in the quarter was 22.3%, inclusive of $40 million of cash outflow for acquisition-related costs, integration activities and elevated capital expenditures. To date, we have incurred $210 million of the anticipated $250 million headwind we discussed last November. Please turn to Slide 8. Our adjusted earnings per share increased $0.14 from the prior year. Strong performance from operations, especially in our software and control businesses contributed $0.16. Corporate was a $0.02 drag due to a higher income tax rate caused by an earnings mix skewed toward higher rate jurisdictions. AspenTech contributed an incremental $0.03 versus the prior year, higher than expected due to outperformance in GACV and higher revenue. Test and Measurement contributed $0.09, slightly below expectations driven by lower volume. We also had a $0.01 headwind to expectations in Q3 as we stopped accruing interest income from the Copeland note receivable when we reached a definitive agreement to sell it on June 6. Please turn to the next slide for details on our updated guidance for 2024. Fiscal year 2024 underlying sales are now expected to grow approximately 6%, in line with the midpoint of our May guidance, which is supported by our process and hybrid businesses, which continue to perform well amid a delayed discrete recovery and a weaker China. Reported net sales growth is expected to be approximately 15%, with Test and Measurement contributing approximately 9.5 points of growth, offset by a 0.5 point drag from FX. We are increasing our operating leverage expectations to the mid- to high 40s, driven by the strong leverage performance through the first 9 months and strong leverage expected in Q4. We are raising the midpoint of adjusted EPS guidance and expect $5.45 to $5.50. Test and Measurement is now expected to contribute $0.42 to $0.44. Test and Measurement is a business with very strong leverage, so the impact of our synergy actions are helping maintain profitability despite a weaker volume environment than initially planned. For the full year, we expect Test and Measurement's adjusted segment EBITDA margin to be approximately 23%, a couple of points above the prior year benefiting from the synergy realization. With AspenTech's strong results in Q3, we are bringing their expected EPS contribution back up to $0.32 to $0.34. We are also raising our free cash flow expectations for the year to approximately $2.8 billion, driven by the working capital improvements and Q3's performance. Dividend and tax rate expectations are unchanged, and we now expect approximately $300 million of share repurchase. We have been focused on debt pay down, particularly with short-term interest rates staying higher for longer, and we retired \u20ac500 million of term debt that came due in Q3. Our performance through the first 9 months has exceeded expectations, and we are excited to continue delivering strong results. Our transformed portfolio has meaningfully improved with higher profitability driven by gross profit margins above 50% and higher organic growth driven by secular trends, and our Emerson management system is driving operational excellence. With that, I'll turn the call over to the Q&A portion of our call. Operator : Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question we have will come from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Two questions, one big picture and one smaller picture, I guess. First off, kind of the big picture stuff. Lal, this idea of kind of software-defined automation and what you're doing with Ovation. I think this is also sort of instrumental to better collaborating, integrating whatever you want to say, between DeltaV and Aspen's offerings. Maybe you could kind of address that, if I'm correct in that assumption and where you're at and sort of kind of propagating that change in technology posture across rest of the portfolio. Lal Karsanbhai : Yeah. Good morning, Jeff, good to hear from you. No, you're absolutely right. As we laid out that vision, it certainly is designed to accomplish a couple of factors. The first being to liberate the data that exists in silos across operations in broad industry. And the second then is to actually use the analytics power to drive productivity, efficiency, higher levels of safety and efficiency with analytic packages inclusive of much of what AspenTech can bring to the table to optimize facilities and production. So that vision certainly exists. We are on the path to bring compute out of centralized siloed data approaches into the edge, which is the first step with products that have already released in the marketplace with DeltaV, and we'll continue to move forward to deliver on the vision. But this step with Ovation was very critical as well because, as you know, that serves the power and water industries exclusively and to be able to bring that capability into those markets was critical. Jeff Sprague : Great. And then kind of more near term, and I may have missed it. I was on 5 or 10 minutes late. But kind of the shorter-cycle elements of the portfolio, just your view on when discrete bottoms when NI bottoms, you brought down the order outlook a little bit for the year, which is probably tied to those end markets. But maybe just what you see as we start to look into 2025 and the eventual bottoming and turning in those end markets? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. No, certainly. So the discrete cycle recovery has been slower than expected. We certainly believe that we can get to close to positive orders in the last quarter of the year here on discrete, but that will be, of course, based on some very weak comparisons. But that will start us on the path to recovery into 2025. Test and Measurement, a little slower. We're watching our customers very carefully there, speaking, engaging with them. We're watching our peers in the marketplace as well and their performance. And we foresee sales turning positive there in the second half of 2025 with orders turning positive in the first half of 2025. And then lastly, Jeff, I'll just add that offsetting a lot of that is what continues to be a strong capital cycle formation cycle here with process and hybrid markets and also momentum in what we see at AspenTech. And so those offset a little bit of how we're thinking. Certainly, I believe that as we think about 2025 and start to guide that we will be probably towards the lower end of that range that we've given on our through-the-cycle expectations, but well within that. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you. Operator : And next, we have Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. Just want to pick up on the last question from Jeff there. The $1.45 billion to $1.5 billion range for Test and Measurement in 4Q is obviously quite wide. I think just given the expectation that we don't get to revenue growth until the second half of the year, it seems that we're tracking towards the lower end of that range. Just wanted to make sure that was correct. Lal Karsanbhai : We guided because we still have confidence that we can hit within that guide, Nigel, I certainly don't -- wouldn't write it up to the low end of the range at this point. This is the best guide that we feel we can commit to as a management team. Obviously, at some point in the midpoint is how you can think about it. Nigel Coe : Okay. Great. And just to kind of zooming out a sort of a general comment on the environment out there. Obviously, we've seen deterioration in sort of general industrial markets, it feels like some projects are again delayed with some of the uncertainty, maybe higher rates. Just give an overview in terms of what you're seeing out there from customers, maybe a bit more of an end market overview. And just wondering, obviously, the funnel remains very vibrant, increased slightly Q-over-Q. But what about this funnel to order kind of conversion process? Are you starting to see longer decision-making? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. Thanks, Nigel. Yes, I'll comment. Of course, the funnel did grow, as you noted. We booked approximately an equal amount that we've been booking historically on a quarterly basis, $350 million in value. The mix changes a little bit depending on end market timing, and we shared that with you as well in the deck. So I continue to look at this the funnel and the capital formation cycle in a positive manner. I haven't seen degradation of projects or projects being eliminated. I haven't seen any slowdown in the expansion of the journey -- the sustainability projects or the LNG, particularly as it relates to the Middle East and Africa. So I'm still very optimistic there. Now what we do -- we are watching very carefully is that projects that have been booked, the pace at which our customers are willing to accept product whether there are delays that are being implemented around inspections and other areas, we're watching that very carefully, and we have experienced some of that in the quarter, which obviously contributed to our lower sales 3% versus the low end of our guide versus the expectation. But that -- there's some of that going on, which obviously we're watching very carefully. Mike Baughman : I would just add to that, Nigel, some of that read through in the leverage this quarter. We talked in the comments about some projects that did get pushed out, which was a little addition by subtraction because those projects are generally lower margin. So it was part of the 67% in the quarter. Lal Karsanbhai : That's a very good point. And of course, lastly, Nigel, to the question. Our process and hybrid orders are still up mid-single digits, and that's important to recognize. Nigel Coe : That's great. Thanks, Lal. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, sir. Operator : And next, we have Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, everybody. And congrats on navigating through the choppiness here. I kind of curious, I mean you're going to have a fair amount of cash on hand. Once you get this Copeland thing done, seem kind of in a good spot from a leverage. Do you feel like you -- I mean, I guess my question really is, what do you plan to do on the proceeds, but I guess more explicitly is, do you feel like you have the capacity to do M&A? Or are we still digesting NATI [ph] this point and want to focus on that? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. No, certainly, I feel great about the balance sheet and what we have to do in terms of maintaining our investment grade. And I think that's very important. We are working very hard to integrate National Instruments and feel really good about the progress that, that team continues to make. It's a set of markets that we like that will drive differentiation and through the cycle growth for our company. And I think that's -- that we feel very good. Now having said all that, we will have the capacity, if we wish to put that balance sheet to work. And that's something that, Scott, as you know, will continue to evaluate the time and what the right move would be in terms of the majority position that we own in AspenTech. Scott Davis : Okay. Fair enough. And then I wanted to follow up on Jeff's question on Ovation because I think it's -- you put it on a slide, and it's not a product line. I think historically, you guys have talked about it a lot, but it is a pretty powerful installed base that you have. I mean how big a deal is this 4.0 upgrade? And is there a way for us to think about like what percentage of your installed base you would expect to upgrade? Or is there some sort of kind of way to tangibly think about the impact of this iteration? And is iteration even the right word to use? Is it a step change, a meaningful step change where you kind of hit that tipping point where people -- like you said 70% of the people came to your event, where people just generally hit the bid on that more so than maybe they did in the past. Any color there would be helpful? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. From an Ovation perspective, we've continued to have significant releases in the capabilities of that technology over time. And this is certainly a significant one, which incorporates a lot of technology from Aspen and fundamentally from an optimization perspective, from an analytics perspective, from -- in terms of copilots provides capability that we've not had innovation before. And I think it is significant given the fact that the investment in the power generation infrastructure in this country and globally is at a tipping point. And just given the boom in AI and data centers, and we talked about it in the last earnings call, we expect the power generation investments as well as transmission and distribution and renewable to be a very, very important growth vector for us. Innovation 4.0 certainly positions us very well in that capacity. And frankly, on greenfield, our modernizations are lifetime extensions of power plants, but also the opportunity to go in and upgrade existing systems with the new capabilities that we have in 4.0. So that's really what we're very excited about. Mike Baughman : And I think the step change here to your question, Scott, lands on the use of the AI models, which will enable planning purposes around maintenance, taking down assets for turnaround activity. It will give a higher probability that you're actually going to work on the maintenance records and elements that are -- that most needed in the plant. And I think that's incrementally new and different in the marketplace. And then lastly, Scott, we're highlighting this innovation, but innovation is a core pathway as we've talked in the past, of how we drive differentiated growth at Emerson. Accelerated innovation across our businesses is critical. And we've seen that. You see that as we report R&D spend as a percent of sales, then we have stepped that up, and this is an element in one of the results of that. Scott Davis : Okay. Appreciate the color. Thank you, guys. Mike Baughman : Thank you, Scott. Operator : And next, we have Deane Dray of RBC Capital. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : I'd like to go back to Page 5 and ask whether you're seeing much demand or overlap with the mega projects. I guess the latest count is 440 projects over $1 billion. If -- how much does this funnel overlay to those? And what kind of visibility do you have? Lal Karsanbhai : So in terms of -- I'm not quite sure the reference you made, Deane, can you clarify the mega projects you referenced? Deane Dray : Yes. This has been a big focus across the industrials for the past year, looking at North America, non-res construction projects over $1 billion, and it encompasses everything from software to batteries. But it's just -- it's a way for us to look at all these secular drivers and how are they translating actually into projects. So it's become this benchmark indicator that we're using now. And so that's the reason I'm asking. You're looking at this funnel, it's a global funnel, I get it, but within -- for North America, how much overlap do you have with these so-called mega projects or maybe you have that information. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, we'll go back and map that, but what I will tell you is in terms of LNG, in terms of energy, in terms of life sciences and frankly, also semiconductors and EVs, we have our own map of all the project activity in North America. We'll go back and map it with what you're referencing, but I will tell you that we are certainly participating and every one of those projects are in our funnel with very, very good win rates. And -- but it's an action we'll take away and work with Colleen and get that map. But our participation in North America on those large projects remains very solid. And we had a very good level of project activity in North America, particularly in life sciences and power in the control systems business even in the current quarter. Colleen Mettler : Yes. And as a reminder, that funnel represents our automation content versus what the entirety of a project is out there in the universe. So that's also to keep in mind. Deane Dray : Of course. All right. So we'll be looking forward to that. And then second question is a bit of a follow-up from Scott on the balance sheet and the cash. Just can you talk to the decrease in buybacks? I know you said that your use of capital was buying back the Copeland note, but all cash is fungible and just directionally to be pulling away from buybacks. Just maybe -- I know it's early to talk about '25, but just where do buybacks fit in your priorities? Mike Baughman : Deane, it's Mike. Yes, buybacks are definitely still in the priority along with the dividend and returning capital to shareholders generally. We will exit the year with the commercial paper paid off and 3.5 - $3.5-plus billion [ph] of cash on the balance sheet. But our capital allocation will remain the same. We will continue to focus on funding our organic growth initiatives, we'll be continue to be committed to the dividend and bolt-on M&A that improves the portfolio. And then, of course, there'll be share buybacks. So yes, we will continue with share buyback. We'll be in the market this quarter at, we think, roughly $125 million, which gets us back to that roughly $500 million a year pace. Deane Dray : Thank you. Operator : Next, we have Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Good morning. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning. Steve Tusa : Could you just talk about like the seasonality of your underlying cash flow putting Aspen aside Typically, I think you have a pretty strong 4Q historically. And you're raising it this year. I guess, how do we think about cash in the fourth quarter and then into next year? Mike Baughman : Yes. So we took the guide up to 2.8 and -- which would imply about $800 million coming through in the fourth quarter, which I think is reasonably consistent seeing a fourth quarter increase. So this third quarter was particularly good. And remember, that has Test and Measurement in there, which they had a great quarter and peeled [ph] about $50 million off the balance sheet, which did skew the numbers this year. So we feel good about the 2.8 for the year and looking at the 800, it looks pretty in line with some of the prior years. Steve Tusa : And then just looking out to next year, anything in the bridge that's more mechanical that you know of today, whether it's merit increases, bonus payments or anything that's kind of outside the normal operating leverage dynamics that we should be aware of? Mike Baughman : I can't think of anything in the kind of run the business. But at corporate, I would say we are looking at a headwind and a tailwind that will largely offset and be a slight headwind. And we will have an increase in pension expense, all things equal, just given the way the deferral accounting works. And then we'll have a lower interest expense because of the Copeland proceeds that come in. Lower interest expense overall with more cash yes. So that should net to a pretty small headwind at corporate. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then one last quick one for you guys. What are the plans for Aspen? Are you guys planning to move on that this year? Lal Karsanbhai : Not in this fiscal, as I said, we'll continue to evaluate Steve as we go through time here. Steve Tusa : Sorry, sorry, I'm already on the 25. I meant fiscal '25. That's I'm already thinking about next year. Sorry about that... Lal Karsanbhai : And forward-looking... Mike Baughman : No comment there. Steve Tusa : Okay, thanks. Operator : Next, we have Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, everyone. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Well, operating leverage for Emerson has continued to be impressive. And obviously, you raised your guidance for this year to mid-40s, which is higher than the algorithm you gave us at your last Investor Day. We know price maybe is fading a bit as a help, maybe supply chain wins are less likely to help in FY '25. I think you just answered Steve's question about sort of other puts and takes, but can you sustain incrementals in the 40s in '25 from what you see today? Mike Baughman : Yes. Thanks for the question. We believe we can. We have a significantly higher margin portfolio today with a 1,000 basis point move over the transformation of Emerson to plus 50% GP portfolio. And I think our expectation certainly is that next year will be very similar to the leverage rate of this year. Andy Kaplowitz : Great. And then, Lal, you mentioned you have decent visibility towards, I think, the low end of your 4% to 7% due to cycle revenue growth as an initial read into FY '25. I guess what do you need to see to achieve that kind of growth for instance? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, go ahead, Ram. Ram Krishnan : Yes. So I mean, obviously, what we're seeing right now is based on the order rates that the second half of this year will generate and that points to the low end of the 4% to 7%. Now what has to change, obviously, at the areas we're really focused on is pace of discrete recovery, the amplitude of the recovery and then China. And now the North American KOB3 or the pace of business is something we're watching. We're not really concerned. Our process hybrid business continues to have order rates of mid-single digits. The capital cycle still remains strong. So that we feel very good about. It's really the pace and amplitude of discrete recovery in China is going to dictate how we guide into next year as we come off that low single-digit order growth we've seen in the second half of 2024. Andy Kaplowitz : Lal, you've seeing China stable at low levels? Or is it getting worse? What's China... Lal Karsanbhai : I'd suggest stable, Andy, at this point. Andy Kaplowitz : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Next, we have Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. I think... Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Good morning, Lal. Maybe where I wanted to start was just around the different end market verticals because I suppose the lowered orders guide and the slight miss on sales in Q3. Was that solely tied to discrete automation? Because I suppose listening to an automation peer half an hour ago, they do talk about weaker energy transition CapEx, weaker chemicals and mining spend and Aspen last night referred to some weakness in those types of process verticals as well. So just trying to understand that element of sort of process versus discrete the outlook there? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. No, I'll answer and let Ram add some color as well from his perspective. Certainly, we continue to see strong capital formation cycle here, particularly as it relates to energy, energy transition, power generation, life sciences, metals and mining. And that is relatively broad from Western Europe through the United States and into Middle East and Latin America. And I -- so I haven't -- I don't have a whole lot of concern today around those markets. We -- I highlighted a few specific wins, but there are others in that $350 million bucket that we won. So mid-single-digit order growth in process and hybrid in the quarter, low single digit for the company impacted by the discrete automation business in the discrete orders, which remains negative to the quarter. Ram? Ram Krishnan : Yes, you said it. I mean I think the cap for us, energy, power, life sciences is driving a majority of our capital project wins as well as the momentum in our process hybrid business. Certainly, we are not a big player in hybrid markets like food and beverage, which could be the dynamic you're referencing in terms of some slowdown. But our life sciences business continues to be very good. Our metals and mining business continues to be very good. So no slowdown, we're not seeing any kind of slowdown in that area. But the area we're watching very carefully, as I referenced, is the pace of discrete recovery, particularly markets like semiconductors and EVs which impact NI, but also our markets like automotive, which impact our broader discrete automation business. Now the one segment of Test and Measurement, where we've seen good momentum is aerospace and defense, driven by government spending. It's 25% of their overall mix. So that certainly come out strong, and that's driven growth in North America, but we are yet to see sustained recoveries in semis and EVs, which are markets we're watching closely. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. And then just my follow-up, somewhat related. But if I look at your backlog, I think that was $7.4 billion at the end of June, so sort of down a little bit sequentially and down a little bit from where it was in December as well. When you think about that backlog, it's moving around entry-year [ph] on seasonal factors as much as anything else. Do you still feel confident about sort of decent backlog growth as you enter fiscal '25? Mike Baughman : Yes. Yes, we do. That backlog reduction for us, frankly, about $100 million, it was all in Test and Measurement. Our backlog in the base Emerson business held effectively flat. Now we typically see a backlog reduction in Q4, but it will be up year-over-year, and we feel pretty good about backlog levels as we enter 2025. Lal Karsanbhai : And I would add to the earlier comment about the capital formation, Interestingly, in the quarter, the control systems business actually had a book-to-bill above 1 record order... Mike Baughman : Record levels. And for the full year, we expect Emerson at right around 1... Lal Karsanbhai : Book-to-bill. Mike Baughman : Yes. Julian Mitchell : That's great. Thank you. Operator : And next, we have Brett Linzey of Mizuho. Brett Linzey : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Just wanted to come back to the discrete comments around pace and the amplitude of the recovery. As that business comes back, should we think about the operating leverage above the 45% framework given some of the cost containment and some of the actions you've taken there? Mike Baughman : Yes. I would say for our discrete automation business, it will be right around in the 40s. Certainly, the other business that's exposed to the discrete end markets, Test and Measurement, given that 75-plus percent GPs will be much higher. Brett Linzey : Okay. Got it. And then just on power generation. So you've talked about some of the momentum there in that business. I think the grid results at Aspen look pretty encouraging. Any update on the strategic funnel and how that tracked through the quarter and some of the activity you're working on there? Mike Baughman : Yes. I mean I think our -- so Aspen clearly referenced the capital formation in grid modernization, which is fundamentally transmission and distribution investments. So our exposure to the T&D side is through OSI at Aspen. On the power generation side, which is the Aviation business, that project funnel continues to build both in North America, Europe, but also we're having a very, very strong year in China interestingly. So overall, the generation capacity that is being invested in across the globe continues to be robust and the innovation that we're driving with the likes of Ovation 4.0 as well as our Ovation Green that is positioned for renewable investments. The activity there is very robust. Lal referenced that one project in India with a very strategic investment that's happening in India and the renewable space is just an example of the types of activities we're involved in with the Ovation platform. Brett Linzey : Okay, great. Appreciate the color. Operator : Next, we have Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn : Thanks. Good morning. I had a question on the MRO. Curious if -- how that performed specifically in the quarter, sorry if I didn't catch it. But wondering if there's an impact of some customer inventory rebalancing, if you're seeing any of that from maybe accelerated lot sizes in prior years? Or if end markets are mainly what you're seeing on the MRO side? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. This is Lal. I -- certainly, in totality, MRO didn't really change a whole lot. It remains at 64% of the revenue in the quarter, which is relatively consistent with where we've been and well within our expectation for the year. Having said that, there were a few ebbs and flows, as I discussed on the call, European MRO was very strong in the quarter. North America MRO was softer in the quarter. We haven't seen anything there that is alarming in any way. We're not a heavy inventory-driven company from a distribution or customer level perspective. Our equipment is generally bought and put into operation shortly thereafter. And so consequently, and nothing alarming on the MRO side. But again, strength in Europe, weakness in North America or softness in North America characterized the quarter for MRO. Mike Baughman : Yes. And just to build on that a little bit. The North American softness, you'll recall in prior quarters, we had talked about how, particularly in the measurement and analytical business, there was some strength, and we saw a little bit of that reverse in the quarter. But as Lal said, nothing concerning. Christopher Glynn : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Next, we have Nicole Deblase of Deutsche Bank. Nicole Deblase : Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys. Colleen Mettler : Morning. Nicole Deblase : Maybe just starting with the T&M business. It sounds like the synergy progress is going a bit better than planned. Are you guys actually raising the synergy guidance there? Or is it more about timing, like coming through faster than expected? And maybe any updated thoughts on synergies in fiscal '24? Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning. No, look, we raised the guide a few quarters ago. We continue to execute across that pace. So no change to the synergy guide, but we are maintaining the pace certainly to be able to deliver these results. Nicole Deblase : Okay. Got it. Thanks, Lal. And then if I could ask a bit of a detail -- a little bit more detailed question. The discrete automation comps do get a lot easier in the fourth quarter. Is it possible that organic revenue could turn positive? Or do you think that that's more of a 1.25 [ph] event at this point? Lal Karsanbhai : Go ahead, Ram. Ram Krishnan : Yes, it's a 1.25. I think orders turned positive in Q4. At this point, we're planning on a first half 25% recovery in sales for the discrete automation business. Nicole Deblase : Thank you. I'll pass it on. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you. Operator : Well, this concludes our question-and-answer session and today's event. I would like to thank the management team for their time today, and thank you all for attending today's presentation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines. Thank you, and have a great day, everyone.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to our host, Colleen Mettler, Vice President of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead. Colleen Mettler : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Emerson's strategic announcement and fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings conference call. This morning, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; Chief Financial Officer, Mike Baughman; and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with both slide presentation we have prepared this morning, which are available on our website. Please join me on Slide 2. This presentation may include forward-looking statements, which contain a degree of business risk and uncertainty. Please take time to read the safe harbor statement and note on GAAP measures. Please turn to Slide 3. Today, we have two presentations that we will discuss. We will first go through our strategic announcements presentation and then we will go through our 2024 financial results and guide for fiscal '25. I will now pass the call over to Emerson's President and CEO, Lal Karsanbhai, to discuss the strategic actions we announced to complete our portfolio transformation. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Colleen. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4. 2024 is an exciting year where we closed our National Instruments acquisition, did excellent work driving synergies and integration and celebrated 80 years as a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Operationally, we performed at a high level and we'll go through our results in a few minutes. 2025 is a milestone year for Emerson as we commemorate our 135th year as a company. This longevity is only possible due to the talent, dedication and innovative spirit of our Emerson employees through the decades and I'm grateful for their continued contributions. Emerson has undergone many transformations during this storied history, and I'm excited to announce our final steps to complete our portfolio transformation, which started 3.5 years ago. Our intent has been unwavering in the execution of our vision to create a cohesive industrial technology portfolio. Transformation and evolution have been hallmarks of past Emerson generations. [indiscernible] Chuck Knight and David Farr all had visions and reinvented this great company. And now this is a trademark of this management team that I have the privilege to lead. Please turn to Slide 5. First, Emerson has made a proposal to acquire the remaining shares of AspenTech for $240 per share in cash, which values AspenTech at an EBITDA multiple consistent to our original transaction. Given our position as a 57% shareholder of AspenTech, our proposal must be made public and filed under our 13-D reporting obligations as and when delivered to AspenTech. We were prohibited from engaging in any take private discussions with AspenTech ahead of such public disclosure. Now that our proposal has been made public, we look forward to engaging privately with a special committee of AspenTech's Board to reach a definitive agreement that will benefit both Emerson and AspenTech shareholders. If we reach an agreement with the special committee, Emerson's proposal is that the transaction be affected by a tender offer that would be subject to a non-waivable condition that at least a majority of the AspenTech common stock held by minority stockholders be tendered in accordance with the MSW framework. I wish to emphasize that in our capacity as a stockholder of AspenTech, we are only interested in acquiring the shares of the Company that we do not currently own. And accordingly, we have no interest in a disposition or sale of our holdings in the Company. This is an exciting opportunity to bring two exceptional companies fully together and unlock significant value creation potential for shareholders, employees and customers. Since completing our initial investment in 2022, our partnership with AspenTech has been highly productive and has advanced our capabilities in software-defined automation. The success of our operating partnership with AspenTech over the last two years gives us confidence that the time is right to bring Emerson and AspenTech together. The combination of Emerson and AspenTech would advance key initiatives, create new opportunities through full integration as a single company and further accelerate Emerson's industrial software strategy. Additionally, as a single company, leveraging the proven Emerson Management System, we expect there to be immediate additional cost synergies from the transaction. Finally, we believe this transaction and the simplified structure would make it easier for our investors to value and model our company. Second, we have commenced a process to explore strategic alternatives, including a cash sale for our Safety & Productivity business to maximize shareholder value. This segment, which includes Emerson's legacy tools businesses, is approximately 8% of 2024 revenue and comprises the remaining businesses not related to automation in Emerson's portfolio. This business has industry-leading margins and cash flow, but does not fit our automation thematic. Third, we announced that we are increasing our return of capital to shareholders. We plan to repurchase approximately $2 billion of common stock in fiscal 2025, and expect to complete $1 billion by the end of the fiscal first quarter. Together with the dividend, we expect to return approximately 100% of our guided free cash flow in 2025 to shareholders. The repurchase underscores Emerson's commitment to driving shareholder returns as we believe the current multiple does not accurately reflect Emerson's strong outlook, significant free cash flow generation and benefits of the strategic actions announced today. It's important to note that post transactions, we expect to maintain our A2A credit rating. Please turn to Slide 6. AspenTech is a leading industrial software company that delivered $1.1 billion in revenue and $941 million in ACV in 2024. AspenTech's process simulation and optimization software delivers efficiency and productivity gains in mission-critical environments for its global customer base, including top EPC, utilities, chemicals and energy companies. AspenTech's innovative software product capabilities are critical to helping these customers address the dual challenge of maximizing production output while also achieving sustainability goals by enabling digital transformation at scale to optimize asset performance across its life cycle. Their software portfolio includes their heritage AspenTech businesses as well as the two businesses we contributed to the initial deal, SSE and DGM. Today, Emerson's leading Automation Solutions and AspenTech's industrial software capabilities provide our customers with an unparalleled portfolio of offerings. Our future vision as an integrated company would accelerate innovation to deliver significant value and move the industry forward. Please turn to Slide 7. We believe bringing AspenTech fully under Emerson's ownership at this time would enable us to combine technology capabilities to rapidly accelerate our vision of moving the control system landscape to a software-defined enterprise automation architecture. In today's typical manufacturing facility, there are clear delineations between different levels of the automation technology stack. Field devices send data through a variety of communication protocols into control hardware and embedded software in a distributed control system that runs the production and safety operations in the facility. This automation loop is the traditional strength of the Emerson portfolio. AspenTech's optimization software sits on top of this architecture providing design, operations and maintenance suites to improve overall plant performance. Today, even within a single plant, field devices and control hardware typically come from multiple manufacturers with complex web of connections that are designed to provide data up the stack to specific departments. For example, production and maintenance data are separately managed for those departments. This inherently siloed approach limits customers' ability to drive maximum efficiency, uptime and reliability in our operations. With a fully aligned portfolio and technology road map and use of the latest technological developments that Emerson is pioneering, we believe we can move the industry to a software-defined approach in which field devices for mobile manufacturers feed data seamlessly into edge controllers that make use of a unified data fabric democratizing operational data. That data fabric would then be available to a suite of control and optimization software modules that will vary depending on specific customer needs. We call the full suite of software modules, Emerson's Enterprise Operations platform, which will run production into our safety, reliability and optimization at the site regionally, and eventually at the enterprise level for all our customers. Please turn to Slide 8. Our customers continue to evolve their production to improve efficiency and apply the latest technologies to operational footprints. While today, they continue to value the traditional benefits of the automation technology stack including security, reliability and redundancy, they are increasingly looking to benefit from new technologies that enable step changes in the productivity and longevity of facilities and production assets. Emerson's Enterprise Operations platform will connect the field, edge and cloud across manufacturers to provide customers with the flexibility to manage the operations of assets from individual sites to the broad enterprise in whatever way is best for their needs. We will deploy this capability in phases, moving from foundational integration of our various software modules to site level and then eventually enterprise-wide control and optimization. Fully alignment of technology road maps between Emerson and AspenTech is crucial to realizing this vision. We believe this approach will move the existing $30 billion control system and optimization software TAM from its current construct of 1/3 software, 2/3 hardware and services for a predominantly software-based market, growing high single digits with a significant proportion of recurring revenue. Please turn to Slide 9. The breadth and depth of Emerson and AspenTech's software capabilities across engineering and design, operations, asset performance and data management is unparalleled in our space, providing a broad set of customers with unique value across the full life cycle of their assets. Customers use our suite of applications to design and simulate their processes, control and optimize production to maximize throughput and quality, proactively monitor their capital assets and take action before an issue emerges and more effectively utilize the wide variety of structured and unstructured data that they generate. By fully integrating AspenTech within Emerson, we'll be able to align our technology road maps more effectively and rapidly thereby accelerating the achievement of our vision of software -- automation and delivering significant value to our customers. Please turn to Slide 10. Across the key capabilities required to offer customers an Enterprise Operations platform, we believe the combination of Emerson and AspenTech would have unique offerings relative to our leading automation competitors as well as to nontraditional players like ERP and cloud providers. In particular, our extensive experience integrating software modules to our distributed control system suite, our leading approach to zero trust cybersecurity and our insights into native connectivity with field devices enable us to provide compelling value to our customers. For total clarity, AspenTech's suite of optimization software solutions would continue to be actively sold on top of third-party control systems as they are today. Turning to Slide 11. We believe this transaction would create significant value for our shareholders as well. We see meaningful opportunities to leverage Emerson's management system to improve operating margins, cash flow and innovation productivity as we have demonstrated with test and measurement. The primary areas for synergy targets include corporate costs and G&A where we would strive to streamline duplicative functions, leverage a regional best cost model, consolidate facilities, and use Emerson's scale to reduce third-party spend. For R&D, we can enhance the productivity of spend and leverage common capabilities while supporting accelerated investment as we build out the Enterprise Operations platform. We believe the transaction will meet Emerson's return thresholds, and we expect the impact to adjusted earnings per share to be neutral in fiscal 2025 with synergies. Please turn to Slide 12. Now is the right time to acquire all outstanding shares of common stock of AspenTech. The combination of Emerson and AspenTech would accelerate the achievement of our software-defined automation strategy and provide unparalleled value to customers. As a single company, leveraging the proven Emerson management system, there would be immediate additional cost efficiencies from the transaction in addition to opportunities to enhance operational performance at AspenTech. Lastly, a single integrated company reduces structural complexity for our investors. We are excited by the opportunity to bring AspenTech fully into Emerson. Please turn to Slide 13. Our second announcement this morning is that we have commenced a review of strategic alternatives for the Safety & Productivity business, including a cash sale. This business is a $1.4 billion global manufacturer of professional plumbing and electrical tools as well as wet dry and commercial vacuums with leading gross margins and strong free cash flow generation. Safety & Productivity is a technology-based business with premium brands, including RIDGID, Klauke and Greenlee that is exposed to attractive growth drivers such as reshoring and domestic manufacturing, but is not aligned to our strategic road map. There is no deadline or definitive timetable set for the completion of the strategic alternative process or assurance the process will result in any transaction. Please turn to Slide 14. We are focused on our value creation road map. And at the successful completion of these strategic actions, we will have created a highly attractive $16 billion global industrial technology company with a comprehensive portfolio of software-defined and hardware advantaged automation solutions. Our cohesive portfolio generates strong profitability and cash. And our growth platforms are aligned to underlying secular market trends, which will deliver significant growth going forward to support our 4% to 7% through-the-cycle organic growth framework. Industrial software is our largest growth platform, and software represents approximately 14% of post-transaction sales, which is well positioned to increase as we drive the software content in our business higher. ACV, which is an operating metric used to gauge the underlying health of software businesses is $1.4 billion and grew at 10% year-over-year. We will simplify the reporting segments with these transactions moving from seven to five as we intend to consolidate AspenTech into Control Systems & Software. We have conviction in the profit and growth potential of this premier collection of industrial technology assets centered on an automation thematic and we are excited to deliver further growth, margin expansion and shareholder value creation. The AspenTech proposal was made public today pursuant to regulatory obligations and we have walked you through our plan and why we are pursuing this transaction now. The next steps in both of the portfolio transactions announced today will be done privately. We do not intend to make any further public statements or announcements regarding the proposal or review of the strategic alternatives until such time as a definitive agreement is reached or a further disclosure is appropriate. We will not be taking or answering any questions on the AspenTech proposal today or until such time is appropriate. I will now turn the call over to Mike Baughman, to review our 2024 results and 2025 guidance. Mike Baughman : Thanks, Lal, and good morning, everyone. We will now go to the next presentation, shifting the call to the earnings press release and discuss our 2024 financial results and 2025 guidance. We will also share with you what we are seeing in our funnel and end markets. Please join me on Slide 16. We continue to deliver on our value creation framework. As you can see in this chart, 2024 was another excellent year that met or exceeded guidance. Underlying sales grew 6% and operating leverage was 47%, both in line with August guidance. Adjusted EPS was $5.49 at the high end of August guidance and free cash flow was $2.9 billion, which exceeded our guidance. Quarterly underlying orders growth exited the year at 2% and our full year growth is also 2%. This order's growth was led by our process and hybrid businesses, which were up mid-single digits for the year. Discrete Automation orders were down mid-single digits for the year, but turned positive in Q4 as we expected. Though not included in the underlying for 2024, Test & Measurement orders in the quarter were down 7% but improved 2-point sequentially, and we remain optimistic about a recovery in this business in 2025. Additionally, we executed approximately $435 million of share repurchase above the August guidance as we saw an opportunity to buy our 2025 dilution in advance at an attractive valuation. Our 2024 performance was another year of strong operating results and demonstrates the work of our transformed higher-growth, higher-margin portfolio. Please turn to Slide 17, where I will provide additional color on our 2024 performance. Underlying sales growth of 6% was led by our process and hybrid businesses, which were up high single digits for the year. Intelligent Devices grew 5%, while software and control grew 8% and price contributed two points of growth. Asia, Middle East and Africa led the growth of 8% with exceptional performance from the Middle East and Africa led by strong project activity in LNG and chemical. China was down 3% for the year as chemical and discrete were low amidst weak demand. Europe was up 7% with sustained strength in LNG, sustainability and decarbonization and life sciences. Americas also performed well, up 4%, led by power, LNG, metals and mining and life sciences. Test & Measurement, which was excluded from the underlying metric, contributed $1.46 billion to our net sales, down 12% for the year and within our expectations. Following our typical seasonality, backlog increased in Q4 from Q3, and we exited the year at $7.2 billion. Excluding T&M from this backlog figure, our backlog grew $150 million driven by process and hybrid investments that were slightly offset by the decline in our discrete and other businesses. Adjusted segment EBITDA margin was 26%, up 100 basis points from the prior year due to favorable price cost and cost reductions. Operating leverage, which excludes Test & Measurement in 2024 was 47%, reflecting the strong operational execution and profitability of our business. Test & Measurement delivered an adjusted segment EBITDA margin of 24%, including the realization of $100 million of synergies and a 130 basis point favorable impact from the timing of the acquisitions closed in Q1. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $5.49, up 24% from 2023. Operations contributed $1.06 of growth with a $0.01 offset in nonoperating items. Test & Measurement exceeded our initial expectations and delivered $0.45 as increased and accelerated synergies offset lower than originally expected sales volume. AspenTech contributed $0.35, slightly above our expectations of $0.32 to $0.34. Finally, Emerson delivered stronger-than-expected free cash flow of $2.9 billion, up 23% year-on-year despite a headwind of approximately $235 million from acquisition-related costs, higher CapEx. Higher earnings and inventory improvements drove the year-on-year improvement in cash. Free cash flow margin for the year was 16.6%, a 110-basis point improvement from the prior year. Please turn to Slide 18. Before discussing 2025's guidance, I'd like to review the exceptional financial performance of the Company over the last three years. Our portfolio transformation began in late 2021, and the gray bar shows the pre-transformation results for that year. The bars represent the results for the Company we have today, inclusive of Safety & Productivity from 2021 through 2024. We have delivered three years of underlying sales growth at the high end or above of our long-range framework of 4% to 7% through the cycle, which demonstrates a structurally improved and more cohesive Emerson that is aligned to secular growth drivers. Our differentiated technology and innovation leadership are evident in the remarkable gross margin performance. In 2024, we delivered gross margins of 50.8% for the year, a record for Emerson, and up nearly 1,000 basis points from our pre-transformation portfolio in 2021. We have also significantly improved adjusted segment EBITDA, closing 2024 at a record high of 26%. Our higher-margin portfolio, coupled with the processes driven by our updated Emerson Management System has enabled several consecutive years of outsized leverage performance. All of this has produced three consecutive years of adjusted earnings per share growth over 20%. We are proud of the leading industrial technology company we created and our accomplishments over the last three years. As we take the final steps in our portfolio transformation, we are energized to continue creating shareholder value. Please turn to Slide 20. I would now like to talk a little bit about our funnel and what we are seeing in our served markets. We continue to see strong project activity with our large project funnel exiting the year at $11.2 billion, up approximately $200 million from Q3. Customers are continuing to invest in areas aligned to our growth platforms. LNG, life sciences and sustainability and decarbonization drove the increase versus the prior quarter. The three-year visibility of projects within the funnel, size of the funnel and the continued growth give us confidence that we are in a capital formation cycle where our customers need automation content to meet their complex objectives. We performed well in the quarter, winning approximately $400 million of project content with nearly 60% in our growth platforms. Wins in LNG, chemical and sustainability and decarbonization led the conversion in the quarter, and I'd like to highlight a few notable lens. First, Emerson was selected to provide our leading instruments to Porthos carbon capture and storage project in the North Sea. Porthos will store approximately 37 million tons of CO2 transported from the Port of Rotterdam from customers such as Air Liquide, Air Products, ExxonMobil and Shell. Next, Emerson was chosen to automate a new world-class petrochemical complex in Saudi Arabia. Emerson will provide control and safety systems and software, asset management software and valves. Third, Emerson was recently awarded a large enterprise contract for Test & Measurement software with a semiconductor company that is a leader in the GPU space driving the proliferation of AI. This multiyear contract will support an enterprise-wide semiconductor and electronics production analytics platform to help maximize this customer's production capacity and product quality. Emerson will provide our OptimalPlus production analytics platform, along with customer engineering, operations and support capabilities. Both large project and MRO business performed well in the year, with MRO representing 64% of sales. Emerson serves an expansive set of customers in diverse industries demonstrating our relevance across the process, hybrid and discrete landscapes. Our top 20 direct customers made up only approximately 9% of sales with the largest being around $180 million. Emerson has consistently proven it can capture price in the market, driven in part by the long tail of the customers we serve. Turning to Slide 21. We will now discuss our outlook for 2025. We expect process and hybrid markets to be resilient with moderating growth, discrete markets to turn positive and sales growth in all world areas. We are seeing customers continue to invest in digitalization and automation technology to enhance plant efficiency, reliability, output and sustainability. We expect sustained demand in process and hybrid markets with the capital cycle remaining constructive, as shown in our project funnel with projects continuing to move forward at a healthy pace. We expect MRO to continue to perform well with stable demand in North America and Europe. The demand in both capital projects and MRO is driven by secular trends of energy security and affordability, sustainability and decarbonization, nearshoring and digital transformation, and we continue to see strong activity across many verticals, led by LNG and other energy transition segments, life sciences, power and metals and mining. Overall, we expect our process and hybrid businesses to grow in the mid-single digits for the year. We are still looking for a meaningful recovery in discrete market demand in the first half of 2025, which we expect will lead to a second half sales recovery and mid-single-digit sales growth for the year. The majority of our discrete served markets appear to have bottomed, and we have seen positive indicators of early-stage recovery in semiconductor, industrial and factory automation markets. However, automotive markets, particularly EV, remain weak, and we will continue to watch these closely. Additionally, our Test & Measurement business will benefit from further synergy actions in the year, and we are now targeting $200 million by year three from our previous target of $185 million due to faster execution of our overall synergy plan. We anticipate growth in all world areas led by Middle East and Africa, India, Southeast Asia and Mexico from continued investment in energy and energy transition projects. We expect China to return to growth by the second half for being down low single digits in 2024 as we expect investments in self-reliance programs and sustainability to continue, coupled with recovery in discrete markets, as we begin to lap easier comps. North America is expected to grow in the low single digits, aided by LNG life sciences and a strong outlook for power generation, transmission and distribution due to the significant demand growth for electricity related to AI and data centers. Finally, we expect mid-single-digit growth in Europe from continued investments in the energy transition. Please join me on Slide 22 for details on our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2025. It should be noted that our 2025 guidance is based on the current company without the impact of today's announced portfolio actions. We have provided the relevant Safety & Productivity contribution of the guide to help investors size the potential impact of the strategic review of that business, and we have continued to detail our expectations for our 57% ownership stake in AspenTech. Underlying sales are expected to grow 3% to 5% in the year. Safety & Productivity growth is expected to be approximately flat for the year. And because it is only about 8% of total Emerson sales, it is not expected to have a material impact on the overall growth rate for the year when it exits our results. Operating leverage, which now includes Test & Measurement, is expected to be in the mid-40s. We expect adjusted earnings per share for the year to be between $5.85 and $6.05. AspenTech's contribution is expected to be $0.44 to $0.46 for the year, and Safety & Productivity is expected to contribute approximately $0.48. Full year free cash flow is expected to be $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion with approximately $0.2 billion from Safety & Productivity. For the first quarter, we expect underlying sales to increase 2% to 3% with leverage in the mid-50s. We expect adjusted EPS of $1.25 to $1.30, of which $0.10 to $0.11 comes from AspenTech. As discussed earlier, we expect approximately $2 billion of share repurchase for the year and the current plan is to complete $1 billion in the first quarter. Finally, we expect dividend payments to be approximately $1.2 billion and our tax rate to be approximately 22% for the year. Please turn to Slide 23. Emerson remains committed to disciplined capital allocation and is increasing return of capital to shareholders in 2025 as we complete our portfolio transformation. We continue to have four primary capital allocation priorities. The first is reinvestment in the business, and Emerson spent approximately 8% of sales on RD&E in 2024 and we expect a similar level of spend in 2025. Both Test & Measurement and AspenTech spent around 20% of their sales on RD&E and growth opportunities in these businesses, which is a reflection of our commitment to realize these growth opportunities. As discussed previously, we are increasing our share repurchases to approximately $2 billion and expect around $1 billion in the first quarter. We are also entering our 69th year of increased dividends per share. And this quarter, we increased the quarterly dividend per share to $0.5275. Capital returned to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchase is expected to be approximately 100% of free cash flow in 2025. Over the past three years, we have been focused on portfolio transformation and allocated capital primarily to strategic M&A and paying down debt. We have also returned $6.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks during that time. After the successful completion of the actions announced today, we expect our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to be under two and well within the credit rating agencies' metrics to maintain our A2A credit ratings. As we move forward beyond 2025, we plan to maintain our A2A credit ratings. The Company's expected future free cash flows and debt capacity within the range of the A2A metrics provide sufficient flexibility to continue meaningful returns of capital to shareholders and execution of strategic bolt-on acquisitions. Finally, I would like to echo Lal's earlier comments and thank all the Emerson employees, the efforts are the real force behind these excellent financial results. It's your dedication to our company and our customers that will drive our customers' success and our shareholders' returns. I will now pass the call back to Colleen. Colleen Mettler : Thank you, Mike. As we turned to Q&A, I will ask that you please limit your questions to one, so we can get to as many folks as possible. Please also limit your questions to those related to the quarter and outlook with respect to Emerson. I'd like to remind you of Lal's earlier comments, we will not be addressing questions on the portfolio announcements beyond the information we shared today in our slides, prepared remarks, and press release materials. We will update the market as and when appropriate or required with respect to AspenTech's proposal and the Safety & Productivity strategic review. With that, I will now turn it over to the operator to start the Q&A. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question. Andy Kaplowitz : Congrats on the announcements today. Well, so $7.2 billion of total backlog at the end of Q4 was down a little bit, as you said it would be, but your pipeline of new awards were up. So, can you talk about how you're thinking about Emerson's overall book-to-bill for '25? Do you think you could grow backlog? Could you elaborate on when end markets continue to drive process and hybrid markets to support your mid-single-digit growth expectations in '25? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, Andy. Look, certainly, the backlog come down from Q3 is part of our seasonality as we see these higher volumes being shipped in Q4. We believe the $7.2 billion is a very healthy level and supportive of the guide for next year. So, my expectation is I think about the order environment that we expressed today and the sales environment is a book-to-bill have gone into 2025. So, really no meaningful change there and really well positioned. Andy Kaplowitz : And then process and hybrid, Lal, like it seems like you actually had more new -- well, you had more new wins in Q4 than Q3. Did you see reacceleration, just stability? Like what are you seeing in those markets? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. No. Look, I think the projects continue to move in the right direction. As you know, LNG took a little bit of a pause on new awards in North America, but continue to expand globally in Africa and the Middle East predominantly, which was critical for us. But we continue to see very strong sustainability decarbonization activity in Europe, life science activity globally and power generation, particularly in the United States and Europe to support the data center requirements that are out there. So, feel very optimistic that we closed the year in the mid-single digits from process hybrid and that we have a strong outlook going into next year. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. Deane Dray : Add my congratulations. There's a lot of moving parts, but the slides were really helpful in the commentary. Look, it's -- this little bit of the dog that didn't bark, but you didn't talk about any sort of customer delays, push-outs, any hesitancy about committing on the approval process for projects. Did you see any of that? And then just separately, what's going into the assumptions about the second half recovery in China? Are you seeing any green shoots? Any specifics other than like an easier comp? Ram Krishnan : Ram here. Yes, we did not see any delays from customers. Certainly, nothing in the Middle East or North America or Europe. All of the project shipments that we had baked into our Q4 plan shift. So, we are not sensing any of that. And the capital cycle remains to be strong for us in energy, energy transition, power, LNG. So, the pace of business and process and hybrid continues. Obviously, the discrete recovery is what we're watching. Orders turning positive for our Discrete Automation business in Q4 is certainly a positive for us. And we're confident that Test & Measurement will see continued momentum going into 2025. And then what was your second piece of your question? Deane Dray : China. Yes, China. Ram Krishnan : In terms of China, obviously, the power segment in China is pretty good for us. It's really discrete and chemical recovery. Our hope is, obviously, there's a lot of stimulus. There's certainly some green shoots we're seeing in the chemical space we expect to manifest in the first half. it will come down, the pace of discrete recovery, which we're anticipating to happen in the second half of 2025. So, that kind of shapes up our China plan low to mid-single-digit growth for next year. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question. Nigel Coe : Lots to unpack here. That's for sure. So just on that last part, the DA kind of trends in the first half of next year. Do you think that -- are you confident that we're going to be sort of narrowing the declines in the first half of fiscal '25 from the exit rate from '24? And this is not a question on the transaction, but just maybe just clarify, when you talk about EPS neutrality, is that pro forma total synergies, i.e., not captured in FY '25, but those would be what was actually typically captured in FY '25? Lal Karsanbhai : Lal here. So, I'll take the first part and hand it over to Baughman on the second question. So, on discrete, certainly, we saw discrete turn positive in the fourth quarter, which is encouraging to see that bottom out and set for recovery as we go through '25. The elements of discrete in Test & Measurement sequentially were up as well quarter-over-quarter, down 7% orders in the last quarter, but that's a significant improvement. So, we continue to believe that we're seeing the early shoots, the green shoots of that market recovery, which gives us the confidence in the forecast that we put for the second half of 2025. Ram, any color? Ram Krishnan : Yes. And to add on the Test & Measurement, we're equally balanced across four markets : Semiconductors, ADG, transportation and our portfolio business, which addresses a broad spectrum of markets. Three out of the four, we see good momentum that supports the recovery plan that we've laid out to drive growth in the second half of 2025 -- orders in the first half of '25. The transportation piece, which is about 20% of our sales in Test & Measurement, which is exposed to the EV markets is one we're watching. That's where we haven't seen the turn, but three out of the four markets have turned. And if you saw some of the results are order pace reported by some of the players in Test & Measurement, the -- space, you can see that market has turned. So, it's supportive of a broad recovery in the industry. Mike Baughman : And Nigel, on your second question, just to be clear, you were asking about the comment with respect to AspenTech being neutral to '25? Ram Krishnan : Yes. Nigel Coe : Yes, neutral. Mike Baughman : Yes. Great. Let me do a couple of things to think about there, and we're obviously not going to talk specifics. But looking at models that have been out there, there are a couple of things to highlight for everybody. First is, synergies. As Lal mentioned, we are expecting synergies to come with this transaction. The second thing would be the seasonality of the AspenTech business. This is a process we've begun that will be one that takes months, not weeks to complete. And obviously, as AspenTech talked about on their call yesterday, and as their seasonality has traditionally been, it's weighted toward the back half of the year. And then the third thing that I would point out is that our modeling shows a closing balance sheet with increased debt, obviously, well within the metrics of the A2A ratings, but we do expect a significant portion of that increased debt to be short-term debt. And interest rates, while being persistently high at the long end of the curve, we do expect some decreases in the short end of the curve that we've modeled in. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Stephen Tusa : Just a quick one on the details. The backlog, you said that was up $150 million sequentially for the core, ex-T&M, or was that sequential? Or was that year-over-year? Mike Baughman : That's year-over-year, Steve. That's year-over-year. Stephen Tusa : Okay. Okay. Got it. And then -- sorry, just can you just walk us to that like neutral impact from Aspen for this year? Lal Karsanbhai : I'll take that one, Steve. No, I'm not going to go into the details of outline categories of synergies in my previous comments, but I'm not going to walk through the details of the math there. Stephen Tusa : Okay. But it is just the core Aspen performance. It's not like dependent on like these other transactions and what you do with the balance sheet. It's really just like core Aspen, what you're losing and then -- or what you're gaining, and then the synergies associated with that. Lal Karsanbhai : Correct. Yes, that's correct. Stephen Tusa : Okay. So just where did the T&M backlog end? Mike Baughman : $400 million. Stephen Tusa : $400 million? Mike Baughman : $400 million. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Andrew Obin : You guys highlighted power as a growth vector in '25. I think it's been a while since you've been excited about this. Can you just give us more detail as to what are you seeing in your traditional power business? Maybe update us what the mix is? And then as a follow-up, lots to talk on nuclear upgrades, bringing back mothball capacity, SMRs. What exactly is your nuclear exposure? Do you have N certification on your valves? And what are you seeing into '25 on that business? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, Andrew, Lal here. So yes, we did highlight that about two quarters ago in terms of the acceleration that we're seeing in power generation, transmission and distribution investments, particularly in that case, in North America, driven by data center investment and the requirements for power. It's been manifested in three ways, predominantly in the marketplace. Extension of life of existing facilities, the bringing back of certain nuclear facilities, which were mothballed years ago, and then the build-out of new combined cycle generating facilities. Alongside, of course, a very broad investment in the grid, which now needs to manage disparate sources of generation that impact what is a very aging infrastructure. Power generation represents approximately 9% of revenue in the Company today. It's -- we have seen order acceleration in that business into the mid- to high single digits over the year. That is a very differentiated performance for our ovation business, which today serves just about every segment of the power generation market from traditional power generation sources to hydro, solar and wind. And we expect that to continue as we go forward here in 2025. Lastly, on AspenTech, certainly, the GGM business has seen accelerated growth driven by the investments in the grid, and we're pretty excited about that. Let's say, low teens ACV growth that they've talked about and experienced. So together, that's a very significant portfolio of capabilities that we bring into a market that is reinvesting at a relatively high rate. Andrew Obin : How big is nuclear as a percent of power? Ram Krishnan : Nuclear is about 20% of our overall power business, the 9% that Lal referenced. We have a broad scope of capabilities for the nuclear business, obviously, instrumentation, valves, our control system through a particular channel, and then our solenoid valve category as well. And we have a leading position, particularly in our final control elements and instrumentation. And we have a very, very good presence across all of the nuclear facilities on a global basis. We participate in every region of the world. Andrew Obin : Congratulations on getting a lot done. Lal Karsanbhai : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead with your question. Jeff Sprague : You guys have been busy. Just back one more on Aspen. It might have been Nigel's original question. But I just want to clarify, obviously, you're not going to own it for the full fiscal year. A month that's already passed. Does the neutral comment assumes kind of midyear closing? Or is it a pro forma for the full year? Can you just clarify that? Mike Baughman : We're not going to get into specifics around timing, Jeff, but the comment was intended to be for the year. And as I mentioned, there's obviously a seasonality element to that business that is helpful to the back half of the year. So not going to get into specific timing. Jeff Sprague : And then Lal, it was interesting your choice of words on Safety & Productivity, I think exploring an exit, including a cash sale sort of makes it sound like that's the least attractive option. I assume there would be a fair amount of leakage on a sale, given how long you've owned these assets. Can you give us some context to that? And have you had an opportunity to maybe explore more creative options, spin, RMT, things like that, that wouldn't come with tax leakage? Lal Karsanbhai : No. Look, everything's on the table at this point. I just want to be fully inclusive of all the opportunities that we're considering. And beyond that, until such time that we deem appropriate, I'm not going to comment any further on the structure there. Jeff Sprague : And I'm sorry, just one quick one. The second half timing of kind of discrete recovery, does that apply equally in your view in terms of both legacy Emerson discrete and T&M? Or do you see them on a little bit different schedules? Lal Karsanbhai : No. Legacy discrete turned positive in the last quarter on orders, and we expect that to be in the cycle and recovering alongside T&M. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question. Joe O\u2019Dea: Congrats on the news this morning. Can you talk about this evolution toward more software-defined automation and the time line that you envision for that and how that gets implemented across MRO versus brownfield, greenfield? I'm not sure in terms of the challenges in sort of transitioning an operating system towards software-enabled the way you're talking about as opposed to starting fresh. So, how we should think about the time line towards this evolution? Lal Karsanbhai : Well, it's a journey. What I outlined there, Joe, is a three-phase approach starting at the foundational level at the site. And that's really what we're seeing today in terms of addressing the market needs that exist at a customer level, whether that's digital transformation, this conversion that we've been talking about for a number of years now of IT and OT, the democratization of data that needs to be available and accessible across apartments, asset optimization, which is incredibly important to drive reliability and safety and ultimately remote or autonomous operations as well. The second level as you go through that foundation is to drive it at a site level. And against some of those technology implications, you can probably think about this as a -- each of these steps as a three- to five-year potential journey really depends on the rate of adoption. We're going to be very intentional in how we engage customers, be some that cross that chasm before others and are going to innovate with the technology. And then lastly, on the third phase, that's an enterprise-level opportunity. That's really the proof point operating at the site and those customers that see an opportunity to really drive the same -- those levels of efficiency across the entire fleet of their assets. Ram? Ram Krishnan : Yes. And just to add to that, our technology road map will have a scalable enterprise operations platform solution that can be applied certainly in brownfield-type environments as well as greenfield. So, we won't limit the applicability of the solution to just greenfield. It's very important to understand that there's significant number of facilities that will require a digital transformation road map and the applicability of the solution to brownfield is an important element of how we're going to design the architecture. Joe O\u2019Dea: And then just quickly on megaprojects. We've heard a little bit more discussion of that this quarter. You talked about the pipeline. One of the markets you didn't talk about as much was chemicals in terms of accelerating. What we track is there could be an acceleration in those starts as well. Like Aspen's been still talking about some challenges there. But just overall, in terms of any acceleration on large project starts next year and then specifically within chemicals. Ram Krishnan : Yes. We've seen our chemical activity in the Middle East, for example, be particularly strong. We do expect chemical and petrochemical in North America post elections, obviously, going into next year, to return. We're watching China cautiously. It did slow in China, but we do expect with the stimulation of the economy that has happened that we will see chemical activity there as well as Southeast Asia. We haven't baked in a huge amount of chemical recovery, to be honest, in the plan. Our plan is really contingent more on energy, energy transition, LNG, sustainability, decarbonization, power, life sciences and metals and mining. If we have a strong presence in chemical, if chemical does surprise us to the positive, particularly in Europe, that's certainly promising to our three to five guide and then certainly China. Operator : And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Julian Mitchell : Just wanted to follow up on the organic sales guidance for Test & Measurement because I think the total for the year is sort of up 3% to 5%. It sounds like processing hybrid's up mid-single and discrete is up, I think, mid-single as well. So just wanted to sort of check that and what's embedded for Test & Measurement and how we think about sort of any first half versus second half T&M dynamics, please? Ram Krishnan : So, you are correct, mid-single for process, hybrid. Mid-single for discrete into the 3% to 5% plan. Test & Measurement sales is also mid-single, but high single-digit orders. We consumed backlog this year. So, our plan is to get orders growing at faster rate sales, but sales guide for Test & Measurement is mid-single digits for 2025 and ramping in the second half. Julian Mitchell : And then just my second one around, synergies. I guess sort of two pieces of that. One is Test & Measurement. There's $100 million of synergies to go over two years. Do we just assume a slight majority of that in 2025 to sort of $60 million or so? And really just clarifying from the prior series of questions. Is it fair to say at this point, you're not going to provide that kind of synergy run rate assumption for Aspen? Just wanted to make sure I didn't miss it from earlier. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, Julian. Yes, thank you. So yes, your assumptions on Test & Measurement is fair. And in terms of Aspen, we will provide that color once we have a definitive agreement, and we'll lay the details out for you. But until that time, no comment on the timing or the scale. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll be ending today's question-and-answer session as well as today's presentation. We do thank you for joining. Please have a nice day. You may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Colleen Mettler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Colleen Mettler : Good morning and thank you for joining us for Emerson's first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. This morning, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; Chief Financial Officer, Mike Baughman; and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan. As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with a slide presentation, which is available on our website. Please join me on Slide 2. This presentation may include forward-looking statements, which contain a degree of business risk and uncertainty. Please take time to read the Safe Harbor statement and note on GAAP measures. I will now pass the call over to Emerson's President and CEO, Lal Karsanbhai, for his opening remarks. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Colleen. Good morning. Today marks the anniversary of my fourth year as CEO of Emerson. I reflect on this time with tremendous admiration and gratitude for what we have accomplished as a team to deliver on our collective vision. Thank you to the Emerson board of directors for your trust and support, to the management team for your commitment and energy and most importantly to the 70,000 Emerson employees around the world for your dedication and deep care for our customers, our communities and each other. All of you make me better. Yesterday, alongside the Emerson board of directors, employees, community leaders, local CEOs and Emerson retirees, we held the grand opening ceremonies for our new global headquarters in St. Louis. It was an exciting day. The modern offices align our work environment with the industrial technology company we created, an environment that fosters innovation, collaboration and inclusiveness. Thank you to the Emerson leaders, who brought our new space to life. I remain as energized as I was on February 5, 2021 about the future of our company. Please turn to Slide 3. We are excited about our Q1 performance and the outlook for the year as healthy market fundamentals and our Emerson management system have positioned us to capitalize on value creation opportunities. Our process in hybrid markets continue to demonstrate stable demand as secular drivers propel continued investment in automation technology to drive efficiency, reliability and safety. Energy security, nearshoring initiatives and energy transition commitments are driving sustained spend in LNG, life sciences, power and metals and mining. We saw sequential orders improvement in our discrete businesses although the amplitude was a little softer than expected as momentum in industrial, semiconductor and discrete MRO was offset by muted performances in automotive and factory automation. We are expecting discrete orders to turn slightly positive in Q2 with a more meaningful orders ramp in the second half. We saw robust underlying demand for our software solutions across the portfolio with 10% growth in ACV, or annual contract value, led by double digit growth from control systems and software. Emerson again executed at a world-class level and demonstrated the profitability of our transform portfolio as margin leverage, adjusted earnings per share and cash flow all exceeded our expectations. Q1 underlying sales were inside the guide. Now I'll go into more detail on the next slide. We remain confident in our ability to deliver our 2025 plans and are energized by the robust operational start to the year and sustained high level performance. We are pleased to reiterate our guidance for underlying sales, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow with outstanding execution offsetting the profitability headwinds from the large movements in FX since our initial guide. Additionally, we are increasing our expectations for operating leverage for the year to the 70s from the mid-40s. The growth and profitability of the Emerson portfolio is evident supported by our exceptional team, world-class technology and differentiated Emerson Management System. Last week we took a significant step forward in the final phase of our portfolio transformation by reaching an agreement with AspenTech under which Emerson would acquire all outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock not already owned by Emerson for $265 per share pursuant to an all cash tender offer. You can find our comments regarding the AspenTech agreement and pursuant tender process in our January 27 press release. And we will not be commenting further until appropriate. The strategic alternatives process for safety and productivity is still underway and we will provide an update when appropriate. Now I want to spend a few moments to talk about tariffs. In 2018, the United States enacted Section 232 and Section 301 tariffs, primarily targeting exports from China. At that time, we acted immediately to use price and surcharges to protect profitability and we also embarked on a program to de risk our supply chain for raw materials, sub-assemblies and finished goods. The impact of those tariffs was de minimis due to our swift actions and ability to capture price. The current tariff situation is fluid, but based on our supply chain regionalization strategy, learnings from prior tariff responses and planned price actions, we feel very good about our position. Starting with China, we do not expect a material impact based on actions taken since 2018. Next, we expect the impact from Canada to also be de minimis as we do not have any material exposure there. Last, the situation in Mexico is evolving and we are prepared for a variety of scenarios. We are ready to implement price and surcharges to protect the P&L commitments of the company. And these assumptions are embedded in our guide. Please turn to Slide 4. Q1 once again showcased Emerson\u2019s ability to consistently execute. Underlying orders were up 1% year-over-year, led by healthy processing hybrid markets, which were up low-single digits despite a difficult comp from the prior year, which benefited from the timing of mega project bookings. Orders growth was led by robust demand in the Middle East and strength in the U.S., both from MRO business and several project awards. We saw exceptional demand growth in our power business, as well as continued strength in energy and energy transition projects globally. Chemical in the Middle East and Americas continues to see strong investment from capacity expansion and modernization efforts. Demand in China remained muted as strength in power was offset by weakness in chemical and discrete end markets. Underlying sales were up 2%, led by sustained strength in our process and hybrid businesses, which were up mid-single digits. We saw healthy activity in power and energy markets globally with sustained capital project momentum as customers are moving to meet the demand for energy security and affordability, as well as increasing electricity demand. Robust project activity in the Middle East offset softness in Asia and we saw strength in North America, MRO; and Latin America broadly. MRO also performed well in the quarter, representing 64% of sales. Gross profit margin was a record 53.5%, reflecting the value of our transformed portfolio. We also delivered record adjusted segment EBITDA margins of 28%, a 340 basis point improvement driven by strong operational performance including price cost management, mix, and the benefits of cost reductions and synergy realization. This profit performance in addition to the impact of FX, drove our operating leverage significantly above our guide. Adjusted earnings per share exceeded expectations, as $1.38 was above the top end of our guide and up 13% year-over-year. Emerson also delivered strong free cash flow of $694 million, a margin of approximately 17% and up 89% versus Q1 2024. Additionally, Emerson completed approximately $1 billion of share repurchase in the quarter as guided. Mike Baughman will provide additional color on our financials in a few slides. Please turn to Slide 5. Emerson\u2019s innovation and differentiated product portfolio continues to be recognized by our customers and industry experts. And I\u2019d like to highlight two recent awards recognizing our DeltaV business. In December, Emerson\u2019s DeltaV Edge Environment was one of 10 products recognized as a 2024 Processing Breakthrough Product. Processing\u2019s annual award honors innovative technology solutions that made significant contributions to increase efficiency, productivity, safety and profitability in industrial processing operations. DeltaV Edge Environment was selected, because it is its first of its kind, integrated software solution to help customers access and contextualize data to improve enterprise operational performance. It also enables customers to run AI tools on the edge, moving the compute process closer to the intelligent field to make better use of their data. We also recently released DeltaV Edge Environment 2.0, which now supports batch data integration to help life sciences, chemical and other batch processing industries bridge the gap between OT and IT applications. DeltaV Edge Environment 2.0 provides secure contextualized DCS data to help customers deploy advanced analytics, AI and machine learning at the edge or in the cloud to make better operational and business decisions. This release is another step forward in our vision to bound this automation. As it helps to eliminate data silos and drive competitive advantage. Emerson was also awarded the 2025 IoT Breakthrough Award for industrial IoT innovation of the year for its DeltaV workflow management software. This year's program attracted more than 3,850 nominations globally. And the award recognizes Emerson's next-generation Software-as-a-Service solution to help life science companies more efficiently develop, scale and manufacture life-changing therapies. DeltaV workflow management provides a cloud-based solution with simple recipe authoring, execution and electronic data capture, which helps life science customers scale and deliver drugs to market safely, efficiently and quickly. Emerson has been recognized every year by the IoT Breakthrough Awards since their inception due to our industrial technology portfolio, driving innovation across the world's essential industries. Please turn to Slide 6. We see significant opportunity in front of us for LNG. When we announced LNG as part of our energy transition growth platform in 2022, we expect that the current wave to add approximately 250 million tons per annum of operational capacity, predominantly across North America and the Middle East and Africa. While we are approximately two-thirds through the initial 250 MTPA, we are seeing large incremental opportunities as additional projects are announced to meet the world's growing demand for gas. LNG will continue to play a large role as a transition fuel, and we will also benefit from a rising demand for power generation. An important milestone in the LNG project timeline is when an EPC is selected because this typically starts the process to award automation, which can take up to a year. In 2024, only 18 MTPA was awarded to EPCs, partly due to the U.S. moratorium on export licenses. The LNG project pipeline continues to see significant growth, and we have solid visibility into a potential 80-plus MTPA per year being awarded to EPCs over the next three years as the moratorium has been lifted, and the LNG wave is proving to be larger than we had initially expected. These are large, complex projects in which our differentiated portfolio, global scale and demonstrated project execution capabilities to enable a strong value proposition for customers. We continue to see an opportunity for automation content of approximately $10 million per MTPA of liquefaction across our leading valves, instrument and control system and software portfolio. We have continued to see a win rate of approximately 50% for the full portfolio and greater than 50% for control systems in large LNG projects and are seen as a premier automation supplier globally. For example, around 70% of the world's LNG flows through Emerson valves. And we have won control systems on six of the last 11 projects awarded. Given the incremental opportunity for projects expected to move forward and our projects go, we see a potential for greater than $1 billion in Emerson orders over the next few years. We were recently awarded one such key win, Cedar LNG, a floating LNG facility in British Columbia. Cedar LNG is a partnership between Pembina and the Haisla Nation is being executed by a leading EPC, Black & Veatch. Emerson will provide our leading technology from across the automation stack, including valves, instruments, control systems and optimization software. Emerson was selected through our demonstrated FLNG expertise and global reach. Please turn to Slide 7. As we communicated last year, power is an area where we have seen strong orders growth as the fundamental opportunities in this sector continue to accelerate. As such, we are now classifying traditional power as a growth platform for Emerson. Power and Renewables represented approximately 10% of sales in 2024, and Emerson is poised to capitalize on positive trends across the power landscape as global project investment continues to increase in response to rising electricity demand forecasts and grid complexity. Installed renewable capacity globally is expected to triple by 2030, taxing an aging grid developed for the one way flow of electrons. It is estimated that over $3 trillion of grid infrastructure investment is required by 2030 to support electrification and renewable energy. Utilities are also making large investments for incremental generating capacity to a mix of greenfield, brownfield and modernization projects. Emerson has leading solutions across the technology stack to serve customer needs for power generation, transmission and distribution, including our industry-leading Ovation Control Systems, control valves and AspenTech\u2019s digital grid management software. Our Ovation Control System technology currently automates around 1.8 terawatts or 20% of the electricity generated globally, including 50% of power generated in the U.S. and we also have a large installed base in power across our instrument and valve portfolio. These projects include many types of generation and I want to highlight our strength in combined cycle gas plants and nuclear power, including a recent win in nuclear. Ovation automates 18 of the 20 largest combined cycle gas plants in the U.S. and approximately 100 nuclear reactors globally also use the Ovation technology. Our control valves were the first ever to receive ASME certification decades ago for use in nuclear facilities and have been installed in approximately 90% of the world\u2019s nuclear plants. Emerson has the most complete portfolio of nuclear grade isolation, control, and safety valves and has been serving customers in the nuclear power industry for decades. With nuclear power sales of approximately $325 million last year. Emerson\u2019s expertise in intelligent devices for the nuclear power industry was critical to recently winning an award for the Sizewell C project in the UK. Within the project, Framatome will deliver two pressurized water reactors that will generate 3.2 gigawatts of electricity, powering the equivalent of around 6 million homes for 60 years. Emerson will provide valves and instruments and was selected for our innovative technology and long history of high quality solutions. Please turn to Slide 8. We are in a resilient capital cycle with a healthy strategic project funnel and I\u2019d like to walk through some updates to align with our current portfolio and market opportunities. As discussed on the prior chart, we are now reclassifying our traditional power funnel as a growth platform. Additionally, we have owned Tesla measurement for a year and integrated into our processes including how we pursue projects and manage the business. While semiconductor has been in a tough cycle, we see it as a driver of future growth supported by macro trends such as near shoring, advanced packaging and ubiquity of chips. We have included the large semiconductor project opportunities currently valued at $300 million and are classifying it as a growth platform. With this addition, our funnel now is at $11.5 billion. Excluding semiconductor, our funnel is $11.2 billion consistent with last quarter and up 7% year-over-year. Many verticals in the funnel were up double-digit year-over-year led by Life Sciences, LNG, sustainability and decarbonization, nuclear and traditional power. Combined with the approximately $400 million of project awards in the quarter that exited the funnel, this showcases a constructive environment in which customers continue to invest and advance projects. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mike Baughman. Mike Baughman : Thanks, Lal, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9 to discuss our first quarter financial results. Underlying sales growth was 2% led by our process and hybrid businesses, which were up approximately 5%, while our discrete businesses including safety and productivity were down approximately 4%. We continue to see strong performance from our growth platforms, which were collectively up mid-single digits, led by industrial software, energy transition which includes LNG and Life Sciences. Investment across greenfield, brownfield and modernization projects continues at robust levels. Price contributed 1.5 points to growth. Underlying growth was up 4% in Asia and the Middle East and up 3% in the Americas. Europe was down 2%. Software and control grew 4% while intelligent devices grew 2%. Backlog increased slightly to $7.3 billion, sequentially and excluding FX, total backlog was up 4% led by our process and hybrid businesses, which were up mid-single digits while our discrete businesses were up low single digits. Adjusted segment EBITDA margin improved 340 basis points to 28% a record high. Margin expansion was driven by favorable price and net material inflation, mix, the benefit of cost reductions and synergy realization. Operating leverage of 265% exceeded our guide due to outstanding profit performance and the effect of foreign exchange rates on margins. Adjusted EPS grew 13% to $1.38, up $0.16 and is a strong start to the year. I will discuss adjusted EPS in more depth on the next chart. Lastly, free cash flow was $694 million, up 89% versus the prior year. This strong performance was driven by higher earnings, improved working capital and tailwinds from the prior year cash outflow of approximately $100 million for acquisition related costs and integration activities. Free cash flow margin for the quarter was approximately 17%. Please turn to Slide 10. We delivered another exceptional quarter operationally in Q1. Adjusted earnings per share increased $0.16 from the prior year due solely to operations. Software & Control led the growth contributing $0.09 and Intelligent Devices contributed $0.07. Corporate and other items netted to zero as headwinds from stock comp and pension were offset by an FX tailwind from an unfavorable impact last year. Overall, adjusted EPS grew 13% year-on-year to $1.38. Please turn to Slide 11 for details on our Q2 and full year 2025 guidance. The sustained momentum in process and hybrid markets and our strong Q1 operational performance put us in a position to reiterate our full year 2025 guidance for underlying sales, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. Overall, we expect our process and hybrid businesses to grow mid-single digits for the year, supported by backlog and a resilient funnel. We have lowered our full year outlook for our discrete businesses to the low single digit range. Our discrete businesses have started the year slower than expected, but we expect a meaningful recovery against easier comps in the second half. As Lal mentioned earlier, China demand has been muted, but we are looking to see growth in the second half as we are expecting recovery in chemical and discrete with power continuing to be strong in the region. We are holding underlying sales at 3% to 5% but lowered GAAP net sales guidance to 1.5% to 3.5% due to a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $350 million as the U.S. dollar strengthened at the end of Q1. This FX movement unfavorably impacted adjusted EPS approximately $0.08, which we have predominantly offset with our strong Q1 operational performance to hold our prior guidance of $5.85 to $6.05 per share. We are increasing our expectations for 2025 operating leverage to the 70s versus the mid-40s guidance from November due to the operating performance in Q1 and the impact of FX on leverage. We are reiterating our free cash flow guidance of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion. For the year, we expect to return approximately $3.2 billion to shareholders through dividends of approximately $1.2 billion and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion, of which we completed approximately $1 billion in the first quarter as planned. In the second quarter, we expect underlying sales to be up 1% to 2% and FX to be unfavorable by approximately 1.5 points. Our growth reflects tough prior year comps for our process and hybrid businesses and continued softness in discrete. However, discrete volumes are expected to be up sequentially and better on a year-over-year basis compared to the Q1 year-over-year change. We expect adjusted segment EBITDA margin of approximately 26.5% and adjusted EPS between $1.38 and $1.42. Consistent with November's guide, our current guidance includes safety and productivity and a 57% ownership of AspenTech. We have provided the contribution of safety and productivity as a reference for investors to understand when an exit of this business could look like. For the year, we continue to expect safety and productivity to contribute approximately $0.48 of adjusted EPS and approximately $200 million of free cash flow on flat underlying sales. Regarding AspenTech, we are expecting $0.11 in our Q2 adjusted EPS guide and $0.44 to $0.46 for the year, also the same as communicated in November. Finally, regarding the AspenTech transaction, while the effect of the pending AspenTech transaction is not part of our adjusted EPS guidance today, if we had assumed a successful close in the first half of calendar 2025, the minority buy in would not have changed our current guidance range of $5.85 to $6.05. And with that, we will now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just \u2013 and Lal thanks for the color on the geographic and congrats on the anniversary. I didn\u2019t realize today was the day. Could you just be a little more specific on Mexico? Maybe the size of your COGS down there and what parts of your business are most highly exposed? Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning, Jeff. Thank you. Good to hear you. Now, look, I think we feel very comfortable obviously with the understanding of the exposure related to potential tariffs in Mexico. We\u2019ve done the work with our businesses to assess the required price and surcharge activities that we\u2019d have to put in place and we\u2019re ready to go. But I\u2019m not going to go into the details on COGS, et cetera. Jeff Sprague : And then on the discussion on discrete that Mike went through. Your commentary on discrete is collectively legacy, Emerson discrete plus test and measurement. Is there any distinction to be drawn between what you\u2019re expecting for the remainder of the year in those two businesses in terms of their trajectory or other factors? Lal Karsanbhai : No, that\u2019s a correct interpretation. As we referenced the end market, we are referencing those two businesses. The color I gave really applies across both as we have exposure in all markets obviously certainly one or two weighted one way or the other. Strength in semiconductor in the quarter, which was encouraging to see, certain elements of MRO were stronger, and industrial applications of those products. The offset there we\u2019re watching very carefully is broader factory automation and of course automotive. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Hey, good morning. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Just a kind of a question on like a little bit of a nit, which is the forex side. I think it was a headwind on sales but looks in the earnings bridge on in the slides that it was a benefit to EPS of like $0.04 or something. Can you just explain what\u2019s going on there? Mike Baughman : Yes, Steve, it\u2019s Mike. The benefit of $0.04 was largely some transactional FX that was in the prior year that didn\u2019t happen in the current year. So we had a number of losses that didn\u2019t emerge. And again, that\u2019s not the translation of the P&L. That\u2019s just translating the non-functional balance sheet pieces. And that\u2019s the $0.04 that we\u2019re referencing. Steve Tusa : Okay. Great. And then just one follow-up on the incrementals. I mean like super strong core incrementals here. A little bit tough to explain just by operations. Is there \u2013 did you guys have raw material deflation this quarter or is that just a mix impact? I mean it was pretty much across the board. So just curious as to maybe a little bit more on the bridge for the profits, whether that\u2019s deflation or beneficial mix? Ram Krishnan : Yes, Steve, Ram here. Yes. I think we certainly had positive price, 1.5 points of positive price. We had favorable net material inflation, which is the deflation you referenced. We had strong mix, strong growth in AspenTech at good margins. So the mix was in our favor. So a lot of things went our way in the quarter as it relates to price cost, cost reductions and favorable mix to drive the incrementals that you saw. Steve Tusa : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Lal, so project funnel at $11.2 billion ex semi was pretty stable as you said versus Q4, but obviously there\u2019s a lot of geopolitical and macro noise out there. So maybe just stepping back and opining on the ability of the funnel to continue to grow. I know you highlighted LNG and power. So did they for instance now lead growth versus let\u2019s say clean energy type projects given the new U.S. administration\u2019s focus? And then could you comment on your visibility into process in hybrid markets continuing to grow mid-single digits? I know you reiterated that, but confidence level on that. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. Thanks, Andy. That\u2019s a great question. Certainly we have not seen any abatement in the commitment of our customers to not just make investments to increase energy security and affordability efforts, but also to decarbonize their operations. They seem to be working hand in hand and that\u2019s based on commitments that they have made to shareholders and employees and communities. So, we're continuing to see that across the world. Further, the investments in power generation seem to be relatively balanced. We certainly think that nuclear will have a \u2013 we're in the beginnings of a renaissance on the nuclear space with not just the extension of life of plants, but the recommissioning of \u2013 in the past mothball facilities. There's three such in the United States that have been publicly announced so far. But in addition to that, combined soccer will play a big role. So gas burning, which ties back to the investments made in the field. But we're continuing to see acceleration as well in hydro, wind and solar investments. And of course, the promise of hydrogen continues to be out there with significant investments being made in the Middle East, and use cases being developed in Korea and Japan for that energy. So watching all of those carefully don't really have a sense today or concern about a slowdown in a sustainability funnel and would expect that to continue to be robust through the quarter. In terms of process and hybrid. Yes, we are \u2013 we continue to be optimistic based on what we see in the marketplace. Not just driven by the capital, but also by the modernizations and certainly by the MRO. 54% of total revenue in the quarter continues to be a very significant driver of our business and the profitability in the business as well. Ram and I are going to be traveling around, Ram will be in India and Asia. I'll be in the Middle East next week. We'll continue to get a sense with our customers of the investment, but nothing that we've heard to date would give me concern on the strength of the funnel. Andy Kaplowitz : It\u2019s helpful. Maybe a preview of your trip next week. Like in terms of geography, obviously you mentioned China is still a little slow. Do you think China grows in 2025 and if it doesn't, can you offset it, for instance, with continued Middle East strength? Lal Karsanbhai : That's exactly right. We're down mid-single digits in China in the quarter. We do expect it to better towards the second half, but growth is something we're going to be watching carefully there. The strength really comes from two world areas, the Americas being one, driven by North America and the Middle east and Africa region. That's the press. And then I will say on a tertiary basis, India and other parts of Asia as well. Ram, anything to add? Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate it. Ram Krishnan : Yes, no, I think on China, certainly the one segment that we're watching very carefully, which is a significant part of our sales mix, is bulk chemicals. But there are pockets of activity in power, in exports. Certainly, we have a $20 billion installed base in China. We're driving that. But China overall to your point, I think if we can drive to a flat year in China, I think that's what's baked into a plan. And as Lal said, the upside for us or where we have to really press hard is North America and the Middle East. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate the color, guys. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O'Dea: Hi, good morning. Wanted to spend a little bit more time on the margins. It sounds like price cost was the biggest driver of the margin strength in the quarter and so maybe just confirmation around that and then as well, how you think about that dynamic moving forward is that easing and any color on the cost component of it that market-based costs or more Emerson actions? Mike Baughman : Hey Joe, it's Mike. On price cost. Yes, it was a driver as it consistently is for us. I would say this quarter cost reduction was actually a bigger driver. We did a lot of work last year in as you know, test and measurement with the integration and in the discrete business Measurement & Analytical. We did a lot of cost work that's reading through. We also got off to a great start on just discretionary cost control in the first quarter that I think we'll see some of that come back in the second quarter, and I'm really glad we did that given what we saw in FX and the FX headwind that we're going to face in the back half. The other thing that we thought that Ram touched on was mix. There's business mix in there. The Aspen contribution in the quarter was significant. They had a very strong quarter, which drove the adjusted segment EBITDA margin up quite a bit. Now again that impact in Q2 won't be quite as big. And then there was the FX that we touched on which also drove actually a full point of that 340 basis points in the quarter that we won't see. So, it was a combination of all of those things. We'll continue to see cost reductions in price as we do every quarter. And to give you a little more color, those are running ahead of inflation so it's accretive to the margin. Joe O'Dea: That's great color. And then, Lal just wanted to touch on your comment about being in the final phase of portfolio transformation, and how we think about that vis-\u00e0-vis sort of future M&A appetite. You think about sort of post portfolio transformation that we enter more of a bolt-on environment, but just overall what the future sort of portfolio priorities are? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, thanks Joe. Yes. So, I'll reiterate what I said. I think three months ago. This was a very significant transformative effort for the company. A significant amount of M&A activity to put us in the position that we are in now. And so on a go-forward basis, our focus will be on disciplined M&A around bolt-ons. We believe there are continue to be billion \u2013 sub billion dollar opportunities to bring technology into the company and expand our customer relevance. But certainly returning cash to our shareholders through the dividend, share repurchase where appropriate as we committed to and investing back into our businesses. We have a great portfolio of technology opportunities for organic investment and that\u2019s where the focus will be as we get through this transformation here, which is right in front of us. Joe O'Dea: Thank you. Lal Karsanbhai : Thank you, Joe. Operator : The next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just want to come back to the second half inflection in the Discrete Automation and National Instruments. I mean easy comps I get and that\u2019s very clear. But what about any sort of near-term KPIs you\u2019re tracking? I mean, obviously, we\u2019re seeing some good news on ISM, but are you seeing any kind of orders inflection or book-to-bill above one? Anything to kind of give you confidence that that\u2019s actually playing out? Ram Krishnan : Yes, Nigel, here \u2013 Ram here. First off we saw sequential orders growth in the Discrete business in the first quarter. So that\u2019s a positive sign. Certainly segments where we\u2019re seeing inflection is semis for National Instruments on the Test & Measurement side and also the broader business, the portfolio business, which is again representative of our customers, the broad-based 35,000 customers stocking up and distribution and integrators putting stock back in. So that\u2019s a good sign. Certainly, the North America activity in our traditional Discrete Automation business has been promising. So some green shoots, but again, the way the second half recovery for us will work is certainly sequential growth to the first half which I think is built in at a pretty nominal rate to the plan. But certainly on a year-over-year basis, the second half comparisons given the second half of last year will be more promising. And so I think it\u2019s a thoughtful plan as it relates to how we expect the markets to come back. And the green shoots have certainly been semiconductors portfolio and North America in our Discrete business. Nigel Coe : Thanks Ram. That\u2019s helpful. And then just switching to the LNG slides. Number one, did the moratorium have any impacts in terms of the \u2013 I mean, I\u2019m sure it did, but how significant is the lifting of the moratorium on new LNG permits? And then the pipeline, 35% in North America is a stunning number. Does your win rates vary across regions? I\u2019m just thinking do you have a stronger win rate in North America versus global? And do you expect any sort of big order inflection in the back half of the year? Thanks. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes. No, good question. No, certainly, the moratorium had an impact as investments paused. It was difficult, obviously, to think about financing \u2013 obtained financing in an environment where there was uncertainty on whether you could actually export the product. So we saw the delays in place there, which resulted in a significantly lower amount of awards to EPCs in 2024, as I described. In terms of the win rate itself, no, look, we put significant effort over the last 2.5 years to create an understanding and develop relationships in North America to ensure that we could be in a winning position. But our story is even stronger, to be very honest, if you look at Middle East and Africa where the early projects existed in Qatar predominantly. And so we feel really good globally and our teams continue to operate and pursue in a very consistent fashion, and we\u2019re in a very consistent action around the world. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : The next question comes from Brett Linzey from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Brett Linzey : Hey, good morning all. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning. Brett Linzey : Yes. I wanted to come back to the power and renewables portion of the funnel, pretty healthy contribution in the first quarter there on the project wins. Any context you can offer on the elongation of the sales cycle there or when these wins might begin to convert to the order backlog? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, no, not really a whole lot of color. You can imagine, I think much like LNG; these are large, particularly when you're talking about additional capacity. Those are long lead time projects that take time to work themselves through backlog. I will suggest, however, and I'll ask Ram to add some color that in the modernizations or capacity expansions those go pretty quick. They're a little faster to bring online. So it really varies when you're thinking about building a new combined cycle power plant, that's a five-year or six-year type of venture. Ram? Ram Krishnan : Yes, I think you said it. The modernization projects which actually had a significant impact in Q1 orders performance for us in power will go through faster in terms of conversion to sales. But certainly the nuclear projects which is a good portion of our funnel as well as the combined cycle greenfield plants take much longer to convert to sales. Brett Linzey : Okay, got it. And then just a follow-up on orders, so up 1% in the quarter. What are you assuming for order growth for the year as part of this operating framework on the sales side? And then any color on book-to-bill embedded as part of the planning assumptions? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, Brett, we don't forecast the orders publicly, so we're not going to comment on that. Book-to-bill was greater than one in the first quarter. Book-to-bill was greater than one and we will see our typical seasonal book-to-bill with the first half being greater than one and the back half being under one. And for the full year, I'll tell you that we're expecting book-to-bill to be about one. Yes. Brett Linzey : Okay, great. Appreciate the detail. Best of luck. Operator : The next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Lal Karsanbhai : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Hey, I signed on a bit late. I'm not sure if I missed this, but any comments on how January has gotten off? Lal Karsanbhai : The good news is being you didn't miss anything. We didn't comment on January. I'm not going to comment on it, but beginning of the quarter and we feel good about the guide we just put out there. Deane Dray : Okay. And I know there was a reference to mega projects and there's still lots of focus on where and how they play out. There was a reference to them in on the automation side. Just what's your setup? What's your expectation? How might there be some ways you benefit and some of the tarts that are coming, we think over the next 12 months? Ram Krishnan : Yes. Deane, Ram Krishnan here. On the project funnel, the areas where I think we are well positioned to certainly capitalize are twofold. LNG, which Lal described and in very much a detail and there's a big pipeline of new capacity \u2013 liquefaction capacity coming down the pipe, both in North America as well as in Qatar where we're well positioned and then certainly the power industry. But across the board, activity in terms of chemical modernizations in North America, greenfield chemical in the Middle East, certainly life sciences diabetes driven drugs investments in the U.S. So there's a plenty of activity across life sciences and metals and mining as well where we feel pretty good. So the $11.5 billion funnel, which if you take semiconductors out was $11.2 billion and up 7% year-over-year represents a pretty robust set of activities across a diversified set of industries we're pursuing. Deane Dray : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Saree Boroditsky : Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned some of the cost and synergy actions you realized in the quarter is driving the margin. Could you just talk about how that plays out over the remainder of the year? I think you talked about some discretionary costs coming back starting in the second quarter. So maybe if we should expect a less of a benefit going forward? Thank you. Mike Baughman : Well, yes, there will be a certainly compared to the first quarter; there will be a tempering of some of that cost reduction, but the cost reduction benefits will continue throughout the year. I think the other thing that we touched on that's important to think about is gross margin in the first quarter was particularly high due to mix and that will temper a bit as the year goes on as well. So, I touched on the other drivers as you think about moving forward in comparing the first quarter to the rest of the year, particularly around FX, which was the one point in the quarter. But we will continue to drive cost reductions throughout the year and that will be an uplift to the margin as we move forward. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, you said it, Mike. I think price cost, which was positive in the first quarter, continues through the year. Cost reductions, which was positive in the first quarter continues through the year. What will change is fundamentally the mix dynamic, which was hugely positive and Q1 and drove the 28% EBITDA margin at the segment level will change. We've modeled that into the year as well as dynamics around discretionary spend, which was throttled in the first quarter. Some of that, as Mike referenced will come back. So that's how I would think about modeling margins for the rest of the year. Saree Boroditsky : Great. And just a quick one on the discretionary commentary you talked about factory automation and auto as markets you're watching. Just maybe comment on what you're seeing from both of those and how you expect those to potentially accelerate in the second half? Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, I mean both those markets have remained pretty depressed auto very depressed, particularly on the EV side. And then certainly on the factory automation though, we've seen pockets of activity in North America, Europe, Germany and then certainly China where we have that exposure, have been muted. We are not expecting significant recovery on an absolute basis as we move into the second half. But the power of easier comparisons in the second half will drive growth in both those segments and that's how it's modeled in for the rest of the year. Operator : The next question comes from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Christopher Glynn : Yes, thanks. Just wanted to ask about the overall pace of control system competitive conversions. I think that's part of your story, a lot of end market focus today. But curious about win rate trends as you leverage the combined technology portfolio across Emerson for competitive displacement and any updates on any revenue model changes there in terms of the install value versus recurring maintenance with the control system side of the business. Lal Karsanbhai : Yes, I mean no major changes as it relates to, I think the K [ph] as the installed base win and the MRO conversions. That's pretty consistent with how we have traditionally operated in our control systems business, both with DeltaV innovation. I think the competitive displacements, particularly in our power business continue. That's been a strength of how we've driven differentiated growth in that space and certainly with DeltaV as well. But we couldn't point to any significant change in the level of activity there. I think it's consistent with how we've performed in the past and we continue to gain momentum. Christopher Glynn : Great. And then you talked a lot about margins on an overall Emerson level. I think in particular, Measurement & Analytical and Control Systems & Software hit kind of new threshold levels of profitability. And that doesn't get explained by AspenTech having a really strong quarter for Emerson's overall mix. So curious if you could talk a little bit about those couple segments profitability. Mike Baughman : Yes. So, for the systems business, they had a very strong gross margin quarter. They had some favorable closeouts of projects due to strong execution. And they also benefited quite a bit from the SG&A spend during the quarter. And then on the MSOL business, the Measurement & Analytical business, they had pretty consistent gross margins quarter-to-quarter, very good gross margins, but consistent and benefited from the SG&A. And that was in part due to the work that was done last year to take some cost out of that cost base. And they had some discretionary as well. So that's what was going on with those two. And we're really pleased with the performance there. Christopher Glynn : Sounds great. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session and the conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
