[Operator Instructions] Later, we will conduct question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Emily Duncan, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin. Emily Duncan : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first Constellation Energy Corporation earnings conference call as a stand-alone company. Leading the call today are Joe Dominguez, Constellation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Eggers, Constellation's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Constellation's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Constellation's website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates regarding Constellation and its subsidiaries following the completion of the separation from Exelon that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Constellation's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other circumstances and considerations that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. I'll now turn it over to the CEO of Constellation, Joe Dominguez. Joseph Dominguez : Thanks, Emily. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call and for your interest in our company. As you can imagine, there's quite a bit of excitement here in Baltimore as we gather as senior executives to celebrate the occasion and milestone of our first earnings call. We had a strong quarter with good performance and across the board here at Constellation, exactly the way you want to start off. Our nuclear team, our power and renewables business, and our commercial business all performed exceptionally well throughout the quarter. It's a strong start, and I just want to pause for a second and give a shoutout to the talented women and men for everything they do for our company. You're the reason for our success. Since this is our first quarter, I wanted to start on Page 5 of the deck and take a moment to remind you what we're all about here at Constellation. As you know, we produced the most carbon-free energy in America and have one of the lowest carbon intensities of any large power company in America by a very wide margin. But we're not resting on our laurels. We announced on Analyst Day our goal for our generation to be 95% carbon-free by 2030 and 100% clean by 2040. That's not net clean. That's clean. Our power and renewables business has some of the best natural gas and renewable energy facilities in the nation, and they are producing some strong results. And finally, our commercial and customer-facing business deliver sustainable energy solutions to millions of families and businesses across America, including many of the nation's leading companies. We support our communities by providing good-paying jobs, generously contributing to charitable organizations, volunteering and delivering clean energy and solutions everywhere we sit. All of this work is supported by a strong investment-grade balance sheet that we carefully manage to provide liquidity throughout the commodity cycle. In sum, we are committed to being a leader in solving the climate crisis. We have the financial tools in place to provide maximum flexibility, and we remain a stalwart presence in the communities that we're privileged to serve. Let me flip to Slide 6. Delivering the results that we report today in a very complicated energy world is, of course, challenging. But it's only part of the challenges we faced here at Constellation during the first quarter. In addition to running the business and delivering strong results, our folks have handled the corporate separation with Exelon, standing up new teams and capabilities. We have many leaders in new roles, and I'm proud to say that the separation has gone smoothly and without disruptions. Our IT platforms have had no issues. We're on track to separate the platforms and terminate the transition services agreement between Exelon and Constellation on time and on budget. Thanks again to the hard work and excellence of the teams at Constellation and Exelon who are working on those issues. Our plants continue to operate at world-class levels, and our customers continue to receive top-notch service and be linked to clean energy products. In fact, some of the highest customer satisfaction scores we've ever received as a company we've received this quarter. Since separation, we have delivered first quartile adjusted EBITDA of $866 million. We paid our first dividend. We reduced our debt by nearly $2.5 billion ahead of schedule, and strengthening that strong balance sheet that I mentioned at the outset is a core strength of ours and a competitive advantage. Dan will get into the details of all these achievements and more. But I want to say that, consistent with our past practice, while we are reaffirming guidance today, we will not revisit guidance until we get through the summer. From a policy standpoint, states continue to lead on addressing climate change. Maryland enacted the Climate Solutions Act, which will help the state reach its greenhouse goals. Importantly, for the first time, it recognized nuclear energy as an essential resource in achieving these goals. In Pennsylvania, the regulations for the state to join RGGI are finalized. As a result, Pennsylvania is poised to participate in the program and reduce emissions by 225 million tons by 2030, producing cleaner air for families across the Commonwealth. Both of these important policy outcomes are the result of the excellent work by our internal teams led by Kathleen Barron and all of our community partners. We appreciate that partnership. At the federal level, we continue to work with industry, labor and environmental partners to ensure that nuclear energy is part of the next federal energy package, and earning the same tax credits that other technologies have enjoyed for a long time and ensuring that this vital technology is an American resource for decades to come. Now we all know that we're not across the finish line in D.C. with the anticipated tax package, but we believe that progress is being made, and we remain cautiously optimistic that a favorable outcome will be achieved this year. And look, I know that all of you, like the folks here at Constellation, like to look out the windshield at what's in front of us and not so much look in the rearview mirror. But I do think it's important sometimes to pause and remember the journey we've traveled. It wasn't so many years ago where policymakers and even climate scientists ignored the vital role of nuclear energy as part of an overall strategy to solve the climate crisis while providing affordable and reliable power to customers. Environmental groups, many who cut their teeth in the antinuclear movement, pressed hard to close plants. And unfortunately, some entire countries took that advice. The very thought that nuclear would receive state policy support was a joke to some. Well, obviously, all of that has changed in a few short years as people across the globe have come to understand the critical importance of clean nuclear energy. Unfortunately, the change in mindset came too late to save some plants in Europe, where the painful consequences of very poor energy decisions are revealed today in more pollution and less energy and national security. No one is happy about that. And although you know that we've been a strong voice and at the leading edge of this discussion about nuclear for years, I'm not reminding you of the history to tell you that we are right all along. That's not important right now. What's important is this, as you evaluate our company, our ESG bona fides and our staying power for decades, we believe that it is more evident than ever that we operate the clean energy assets that America needs to battle through the climate crisis. So as we all step back and look at the windshield of the future of energy policy and ESG considerations, we believe that Constellation is perfectly positioned to benefit from the continuation and expansion of policy support and should be a central part of the ESG interest. As I said at Analyst Day, ESG is not a bolt-on here. It's a strategy that we intend to grow. That is why in our first quarter, we established a sustainability council filled with leaders across the company to advise us on ESG issues. We launched 9 employee research groups, sponsored by members of the Executive Committee, and these groups demonstrate our core value of respect, belonging and diversity by bringing people together, respecting what makes us different and special while promoting inclusion at the best energy workforce in America. They also support learning and development of our people. Finally, we continue to strengthen our workforce. The photo that you see here on this slide is of the Simeon Career Academy electricity class at our Braidwood Clean Energy Center. Simeon is a public vocation high school on the South Side of Chicago, which provides college prep and career-focused education. Its student body is diverse, filled with many African-Americans and other groups that historically have not proportionately benefited from the jobs and economic opportunity in the energy field. At Constellation, we're determined to make this change. What I think is really cool here about this photo and what I've seen time and time again in my career is this concept that you can't be what you can't see. And we have here African-American leaders, managers here at the company, teaching African-American students about careers in nuclear energy. You can't beat that. As I turn to Slide 7, I want to talk a little bit about generation operating highlights. Overall, we produced 40.4 terawatt hours of carbon-free energy across our nuclear and renewable fleet, which avoided approximately 30.2 million metric tons of CO2 during the quarter. Nuclear had a 93% capacity factor, and performed 3 outages averaging each 22 days, well below the industry average. As you know, one of the ways that we manage cost after the Texas events last year was to push some work into this year. So our outages this spring were a bit more complicated than usual as we had to do some catch-up work. We did a good job getting after that work, and we have to-date completed our most difficult planned outages for the year, and we are happy to have it successfully behind us as we headed into the summer. The fall outages we have planned for later in the year are the easier ones. Good work by nuclear there. Our Texas fleet ran well during the winter, even during the extreme weather we saw in February. And overall, we had a 99.4% power dispatch match rate during the quarter. In my view, we validated last year's weatherization work on the Texas fleet, and we're done with those expenses. Finally, our wind and solar fleet had an energy capture of 96.1%, again exceeding our plan. Turning to Slide 8. Our commercial business performed very well during the quarter and delivered energy solutions to customers both new and old. During the quarter, we delivered 53 terawatt hours of wholesale and retail energy to our customers across the United States. On this slide, we show our trailing 12-month average win rates for power and gas and our renewal rates for power. As you can see, we've had a great deal of success in winning new customers and even more success retaining customers due to our product offerings and strong customer relationships. I'm not surprised that we didn't miss a beat here in the business. But look, it's very good to know that we retained and expanded relationships as we separated from Exelon. Our customers continue to look to us to provide solutions to help them meet decarbonization goals. We executed long-term deals with Comcast and Sheetz to provide them with renewable energy. These deals support 350 megawatts of new renewable generation being built, represent 12% of Comcast power needs for its operations, and will supply 70% of Sheetz's entire Pennsylvania needs, with nationally -- with national RECS that are energy matched. Great work there. Turning to Slide 9. At Analyst Day, we talked about how nuclear plants could do more than just supply carbon-free electricity to the grid. We can become clean energy centers that can solve the climate crisis by helping to produce the fuels that will help decarbonize other sectors of the economy. I want to talk about hydrogen here. With the right policy support, we've done enough work now to believe that nuclear power plants will be the most competitive place in America to produce clean hydrogen. As we speak, we are completing the construction of our first electrolyzer project in New York under a DOE grant to test the technology. Like many others, we believe that clean hydrogen will play an incredibly important role in mitigating that -- the air pollution that is causing the climate crisis and the local health issues in the communities that we serve. Hydrogen can be used to create clean aviation fuels, to reduce air pollution, reduce emissions in steel manufacturing and other industrial processes. It can be used to power fuel cells that power long-haul trucking and even to create fertilizers and other clean agricultural products. The opportunities for clean hydrogen are almost limitless. And again, we think we can make it at our plants cheaper and more effectively than any other place in the U.S. For the past 6 months, we've been working with a diverse set of public and private partners to develop a bid for a hydrogen hub, powered by nuclear energy and funded under the grants that were included as part of the bipartisan infrastructure bill. We'll have a lot more to say about this as we get closer to fruition, closer, frankly, to the submission of the bid, and you should look for us to provide a more detailed update next quarter. Finally, I want to end with the technology piece here with a new DOE grant that we received. We were awarded a multimillion-dollar grant to explore using new direct air capture technology, so-called DAC technology, direct air capture, that would help scrape carbon out of the air using our cooling towers at the clean energy centers. It's pretty cool how it works. Occidental has created a new membrane that we'll install in the cooling towers of our power plants. It's got a material that chemically interacts with high-moisture, higher temperature air. And as the water vapor from our cooling towers passes over the membranes, the membranes actually trap the CO2 in the air and could then be extracted. We expect this process will allow us to capture up to 250,000 tons of carbon dioxide each year, which will do something really unique at our nuclear power plants. These clean energy centers won't be -- won't just be this place where we produce as much clean energy as anywhere in the planet in a concentrated basis, but they'll actually allow us to remove CO2. So we'll be able to go net negative at these clean energy centers, and we'll be able to use that technology to meet our 2030 and 2040 emissions goals. Then lastly, on the commercial side, I want to say that we announced our 5-year collaboration with Microsoft for that 24/7, 365-day energy realtime matching solution. By combining renewable energy, clean energy, with exciting new battery storage, fuel cells, hydrogen technologies, we're going to be able to provide our customers with a realtime data-driven accounting solution that matches their consumption of clean energy with the production of clean energy on a geographic and time standpoint. As we develop the product, we'll be working with Microsoft to give customers a transparent and independently verified view of their sustainability efforts. We've also been working with the RTOs. In particular, we work with PJM and others to ensure that their systems give us the geographic and timestamp data so that we can match renewables and clean energy generation with the consumption by our governmental and commercial customers. We expect PJM to provide load-matching data to members this year. That's important because we're not going to be able to decarbonize the power sector with clean energy until we have the capability to do with clean energy what we've been doing with energy since the dawn of electricity. That's matched consumption to production. I want to thank PJM for acting upon our request and leaning into this body of work. And finally, before I turn it over to Dan, I'm going to touch on Slide 10 to reiterate our capital allocation strategy. We intend to deliver value to our shareholders through our capital allocation strategy and through a very disciplined strategy of capital management. We are committed to maintaining strong investment-grade credit ratings, which provide us a competitive advantage. We will provide a $180 million annual dividend growing at 10% per year. As I said, we awarded the first dividend in the first quarter. We believe that there are opportunities to grow our business organically and inorganically, and we will seek opportunities that exceed a double-digit return threshold and will deliver value over the long term to you, our owners. And where we don't find these opportunities or where they do not meet the thresholds, we will give money back to you, our owners, through special dividends or share buybacks. As I mentioned on Analyst Day, we'll provide you with that clarity on exactly how we will return value in the back half of the year. And with that, let me flip it to Dan for his update. Daniel Eggers : Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our first quarter results, power and gas markets, and provide an update on our gross margin disclosures and balance sheet. Starting with Slide 11. We delivered strong financial results in our first quarter as a stand-alone company. We earned $866 million in adjusted EBITDA, which is up nearly $1.3 billion year-over-year. These strong results reflect the absence of Winter Storm Uri from last year, which is a $1.2 billion EBITDA impact. This number is consistent with the first quarter 2021 impact at Exelon Generation of $0.90 per share on the Exelon share count or approximately $880 million after tax. We also benefited from higher hedge prices in the first part of this year with the reversal of retirements of Byron and Dresden in September, we're able to sell that output at higher prices, providing some timing favorability before the CMC contracts go into effect in June. We should see some of this benefit continue over the first 2 months of the second quarter as well. Our commercial business captured value through optimizing the portfolio and strong new business execution during this period of higher prices. Nuclear fuel amortization expense was lower in the first quarter of 2022 relative to 2021 primarily due to the absence of accelerated amortization following the reversals of the buyer and interest in retirements. Lower capacity revenues reflect less volumes clearing, particularly in the Midwest, and we faced additional costs for nuclear outages as we catch up from our COVID- and Uri-related maintenance deferrals that Joe referenced. We are reaffirming our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $2.35 billion to $2.75 billion. As you think about full year expectations, in the first quarter, we benefited from some unique opportunities, including the expected stronger power price realizations at Byron and Dresden and some timing opportunities in the commercial business. Also, we ended the year fully hedged in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic. And as I'll discuss in a few minutes, are now fully hedged across our portfolio, which limits the impact of rising prices in 2022 but is showing up in our 2023 disclosures. Turning to Slide 12. As you know, we have seen a dramatic rise in natural gas and power prices over the last 12 months or so, both in the prompt year and also across the 23 to 25 forward price curves, which you can see on these charts. Starting with Henry Hub natural gas prices, forwards have increased on average $0.75 per million BTUs since the beginning of the year through March 31 and $1.50 since the beginning of 2021. As of Tuesday, spot gas was $6.49 per million BTU, and forwards in '23 are at $5.25, levels we have not seen since 2008. The increase in gas prices are driven by a combination of growing demand post-COVID, lower storage levels and a tight supply and demand balance in the domestic natural gas market. In addition, the tragedy in the Ukraine has exacerbated the rise in gas prices as the EU and the U.K. look to replenish, depleted storage and find other sources of supply outside Russia. Unfortunately, for those involved, we do not see a change in these dynamics in the near term at the very least and expect higher natural gas prices to continue. As you know, higher fuel costs will have a significant impact on the price of power. The continued rise of both natural gas and coal prices have certainly supported higher power prices out the curve. Power prices are further being supported by a number of other factors, including clean air regulations expected to increase allowance prices in some of our key markets and the continued retirement of coal units. As you can see in the charts, 2023 NiHub and West Hub forwards are 80% to 100% higher since January of 2021. Turning to hedging. We've increased our hedge position since last quarter that can be put into 2 primary buckets. First, with these upward moves in prices, we have used the flexibility in our ratable hedging program to lock in more forward sales for 2023 and beyond. Locking in these prices reduces the volatility in our earnings outlook, provides more certainty to future earnings and cash flows, and provides us with greater visibility and confidence in future capital allocation decisions. Second, our New York hedge position is considerably higher than last quarter, which reflects the interplay of the New York ZEC program and forward prices. We have a refresher on the New York ZEC program on Slide 18, but in simple terms, the New York ZECs were designed with the consumer protection mechanism that adjusts the ZEC prices as we cross revenue thresholds, which we are now projecting for tranche 4 that begins in April 2023 for the next 2-year term. At current prices, we are effectively fully hedged for our New York output over the Tranche 4 ZEC term. With that context, looking at 2023, we are now 86% to 89% hedged on a fleet-wide basis, which is between 11% to 14% higher than where we were hedged at Analyst Day. And while we do not show it here, you're safe to assume that we have increased our 2024 hedge position by a similar amount, which reflects both our normal hedging activity and the New York ZEC effect. As a reminder, the carbon mitigation credits in Illinois represent approximately 27% of our hedge position in each year of the contract. Moving to our gross margin update on Slide 13, and I should note, these numbers are calibrated at March 31 to the prices and positions, as you may recall, the gross margin table that we shared at our Analyst Day in January were based on November 30 forward prices, but we included a $50 million downward adjustment in our EBITDA guidance to reflect the drop in prices during December. Accounting for these prices, total gross margin would have been $7.3 billion for 2022. Looking at the chart, you can see the total gross margin for 2022 is unchanged accounting for this adjustment. Open gross margin is up significantly since Analyst Day due to the higher prices across all regions, which is then offset by the mark-to-market of our hedges. We had strong performance across power and nonpower new business, executing $250 million of power new business and $150 million in nonpower during the quarter. As I referenced on the last slide, we're now effectively 100% hedged for 2022, so power price moves are having very limited impact on our results at this point. In 2023, total gross margin is up $300 million since Analyst Day to $7.95 billion, driven by higher prices in all regions. We executed $150 million in power and nonpower new business. Contracted revenues decreased by $50 million, driven by the interplay of current higher prices and the dynamics of setting the ZEC level for the next tranche of the New York ZEC program, which I said begins in April 2023. These higher prices resulted in a decline in the ZEC level itself but is offset by higher power prices that are showing up in our open gross margin calculation. Turning to the financing and liquidity update on Slide 15. As Joe said, our investment-grade credit rating is the cornerstone of our financial policy. Investment-grade ratings and a strong balance sheet provide us with many competitive advantages, including ample access to liquidity, the ability to participate in customer channels like wholesale load auctions and provides flexibility in how we provide credit support, such as using final guarantees in lieu of letters of credit. Our credit metrics remain very strong and are well above agency thresholds. Following separation, S&P raised their outlook from stable to positive and Moody's from negative to stable, both while reaffirming ratings at BBB- and Baa2, respectively. Since separation, we have retired or paid down nearly $2.5 billion of long-term debt and term loans, which completed our debt paid out for the next 2 years. We saw opportunities to accelerate our debt reduction this quarter and pulled forward a $523 million senior note due to be retired in June, and then in April, we paid off the $880 million term loan originally due in August for the CENG acquisition. Given the sharp rise in commodity prices and higher volatility, we've received a lot of questions about our collateral position. So I'm going to spend a moment on it. First and foremost, our investment-grade credit ratings provide significant advantages to our liquidity and our ability to run the business. In the bottom left chart, you can see we have access to $5.7 billion in liquidity facilities and use less than half of our availability, leaving ample capacity for times of stress. You will also see in our 10-Q that we have a cash position as of March 31 of $1.6 billion, much like you saw on our September 30 financials last fall, we have benefited from significant cash collateral postings to us, driven by the dramatic rise in gas and power prices during the quarter. As a reminder, we saw a significant amount of generation directly to customers through our retail and wholesale channels, limiting the amount of transactions across the exchanges, which thereby reduces our collateral needs when prices move in either direction. This arrangement positions us differently from some market participants. So let me now answer the question as to why so much cash collateral came into us again this quarter. Two primary reasons. One, we sell a significant amount of gas to our customers. Unlike power, we have generation length, we are naturally short natural gas because we don't produce the physical molecules. We procure the gas and they execute the sale to a customer, and given our contracting cycle, we procured gas at much lower levels than the market today. These rising prices have, in turn, required counterparties to post cash collateral to us. And two, we participate in some power markets where we have more loads than generation length with New England being a good example. Because we have procured power for these customer obligations, as prices rise, the counterparties, again, need to post to us. The combination of these 2 positions leads to the much higher cash balances that you see in our 10-Q. For those calibrating your models excluding these cash collateral movements, we'd still point you to a year-end net debt balance in the low $5 billion range, which would be consistent with the credit metrics on this page, assuming our free cash available for allocation is used for purposes other than incremental debt pay-down. I'd like to now turn the call back to Joe for his closing remarks. Joseph Dominguez : Yes. Thanks, Dan, for that good comprehensive summary. Look, as I think about the last quarter, I'm going to flip to Slide 15. You're familiar with our value proposition. But the things that were important for us were to get the separation done, demonstrate that we continue the performance in the commercial business and the other operating businesses to the same levels or better than what we had done when we were all part of Exelon. We've certainly benefited from some of the changing fundamentals around natural gas and coal. And well, I'm sure we'll get questions about our long-term views. I think it's safe to say that the short-term market, the 12- to 18-month market is something that is heavily influenced by a lot of behaviors. But we've seen fundamental changes. We're not going to go back to the gas price and coal price environment that we saw just really, frankly, 12 to 18 months ago. And that provides strong support for nuclear. I talked a little bit about policy where we have gotten some successes at the state level, and we're obviously still waiting on the federal government. Here's what we believe. Given the importance of nuclear energy, we don't think there will be an energy package that happens this year or anywhere down the road that isn't going to include nuclear energy. And that's a sea-change difference. And when you're an owner of this company, that's an option you have. Talked a little bit about the technical optionality we see with the nuclear plants becoming clean energy centers, where we can power the grid, but we could do much, much more than that. We can capture carbon at the sites, and we can make other hydrogen-related products at the sites that I think are going to be competitive advantages for years to come. You've seen a lot of supply chain issues, inflationary pressures occurring to other businesses. Not saying we're immune from those things. But certainly, given the composition of our fleet and the fact that our costs aren't rising with the oil and gas and coal costs, certainly to the same degree as others, gives us, again, a competitive advantage. And then finally, look, we're going to manage this business in a very disciplined way, both with regard to growth but also the balance sheet itself. Dan talked about that balance sheet giving us a competitive advantage, and it has. We're seeing margin expansion as others who frankly don't have the same balance sheet capability really having to increase margins, and we're getting the upside of that. So I like where we're at here at the end of the first quarter. We have hedged into higher-priced markets. And frankly, our objective is to ensure that we hit the targets we've given to the Street or do better. And so we've hedged, and we've continued to hedge, as Dan said, into '24 and beyond, into the higher prices that we like to see. I'm sure you'll have some questions about that. But I like where we are positioned. So with that, let me flip it back to you for your specific questions. As I said, the senior team here is ready to answer them. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. One moment for our questions. Our first question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd : Congrats on the great results. So I wanted to maybe focus first on just the outlook for federal legislation, and you provided some great commentary. How are you thinking just given the evolution of everything we've seen politically, could you just maybe speak a little bit more to your sense for the chances of success? I do agree with your point that, if anything passes, it does appear highly likely that nuclear support will be in that. So I think that's well-appreciated. But I'm just curious more about your sense of the prospects for something getting across the finish line? Joseph Dominguez : Yes, sure, Stephen. Look, as you all would well imagine, as a new CEO of a new company, spent a good bit of time over the last few months in Washington literally having dozens of meetings with White House policymakers and others. I still believe that there's a strong appetite to get something done on clean energy. I think they don't like to call them the Build Back Better tax pieces, but there's a lot in there that all sectors of the energy business like in terms of the tax policies. And I think there's strong support certainly continuing within the Democratic Party, Senator Manchin and others to get something done. What we're seeing is whether or not there's an appetite to do it from a bipartisan standpoint. And Stephen, as much as I think -- as I said, that there's something in it for Republicans and Democrats, we're all observing the challenges of getting anything done from a bipartisan standpoint, and certainly, this close to an election, that might be a lift. What I do believe is that the Democrats will try to get this done, in particular Senator Manchin will try to see if there's an appetite, but they're not going to be strung out forever trying to get bipartisan support if it becomes evident that the votes just aren't there to get to 60. So I think people are assessing that in D.C. One of the things that, honestly, I thought was a bit of a disaster with Build Back Better was the amount of which the kind of political interplay was being spelled out every day in the newspapers. It was counterproductive. Often is counterproductive in negotiations to have that kind of play-by-play going on and certainly was there. I think they've learned their lesson, and they're very clearly trying not to do that. But there's a difference between not being vocal about it and not doing something about it. We see activity on the ground. I think very clearly here, the next couple of months are going to be telling, right, whether or not there is something from a bipartisan standpoint or the Democrats can decide at the end of the day that they have to move their own bill. We're going to know that here in the next 4 to 8 weeks. But my point is, as I said, more fundamental, we're building this company for the long haul. And I think all of you need to kind of spend some time and take a timeout and remember how far we've come. And I think all of the momentum is at our backs. As at least I appreciate these bipartisan discussions, there's nothing but support for the nuclear components of the bill. And I'm happy to see that. We've worked on it for a long time. And honestly, as I said in my scripted comments here, the work or the problems that we've seen in Germany and Europe I think have simply reinforced the U.S. policymakers the importance of keeping this fleet alive from a national security standpoint, an energy security standpoint. And although we are hyper focused on those things right now, the climate change problems are not going away. That's what we built this company to address. That's what we will address, and I'm confident that policy will back it up. Stephen Byrd : That's super helpful color. Maybe just my last question, just building on your point on national security is uranium. I think you all have taken a very thoughtful approach to ensuring you have uranium supply. But we do get in the United States a decent amount of uranium from Russia. And I was just curious, what do you see as possible moves in terms of supply chain adjustments at the industry level? And then feel free to comment on your position, but I think you guys are in good shape. But more broadly, I'm interested in your take on what adjustments might occur at the national level in terms of how we procure uranium? Joseph Dominguez : I think -- it's not just uranium. I think it's all fuels and a lot of technologies, we're going to see an onshoring movement. And we certainly support that. I'm going to ask Bryan Hanson to provide some color. You pointed out that we're in a pretty good spot. And we are about what we're seeing in the marketplace. But as a general rule, Stephen, I think uranium and uranium-related services like other things in energy, we're going to learn from this situation, and we're going to decide to move those onshore. Again, what I'm liking in terms of what I'm seeing out of Congress is a focus on these areas. We're talking about it. And again, to the extent that there are limits on imports from Russia over some period of time, we support weaning ourselves off of Russian fuels, but it needs to be done in a pragmatic way. And I think policymakers understand that. Bryan? Bryan Hanson : Yes, I'd say we're working well with policymakers, both the industry and policymakers working together to expand the capacity and capability in the United States to provide enrichment conversion services. So I see that accelerating more so as we talk about it amongst the utilities. I think for our company, as we look forward, we've said we're good out through several years around our enrichment conversion capabilities. And if you think about the cost impact to us overall, 3 things I'd remind you : one is nuclear fuels, 20% of our production costs are nuclear plants; two, our fuel team does an outstanding job in their hedging policies and strategies to make sure we use multiple contracts, long-term contracts, different hedges collars around the high side, low side of the prices we would pay to ensure that we have a robust supply; and then finally, once that fuel is actually loaded in the reactor, it's amortized over 5 to 6 years, depending on the length of fuel cycle for that particular plant. The costs are really muted for us, maybe $1 a megawatt hour out through past 2025 for us right now. So we're sitting in a good spot. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : Yes. First, just on hedging strategy. Just given the change global environment and the fact that you have a lot more core hedged through the Illinois agreement, plus also, I guess, the potential PTC, are you thinking about maybe hedging less going forward than you have? Joseph Dominguez : Steven, I'm going to ask Jim to jump in here. We're not vigorously tied to the 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 that you saw from this company in prior years. We have, as you pointed out, through the state support mechanisms, a lot of our volume already hedged -- but look, we saw a good run of prices during the course of the quarter. And Jim's message to the team was opportunistically seasonally where it makes sense let's grab some of that value. And in point of fact, as we're sitting here today, some of the high points that we saw during the quarter have now worked their way back a little bit. And we're pretty glad that we had those hedges. So look, I don't think we're going to be slaves to 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, but we're going to see value. And you ought to know that, as we're going to run this company, we're going to be disciplined around the balance sheet, but we're going to be disciplined about making sure that every time we give a projection to you, we hit it or do better. And so we're going to continue to use the hedging strategy to give us that sort of assurance. Jim, jump in here with more color. James McHugh : Yes. Thanks, Joe. I guess what I would add to your question about, well, given that we have the policy deals, the way we think about this hedging window is typically in this kind of 3-year window, there's some customer contracts that go a little longer. So the way we think about that is we want to be able to Joe's point, capture the moments when we have the opportunity when you see prices run like this, and I think overall, we're still going to be able to have some flexibility, and Dan mentioned the flexibility. So we tie that in constantly to what are we trying to achieve in hitting the targets that we've provided, as Joe mentioned, and achieve with the balance sheet goal of keeping a strong balance sheet. So I think we'll continue the same general strategy with flexing up or down here and there as we see the market move in periods like this. I don't think there's a vast change to the overall philosophy of what we're trying to achieve. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And one other question. You guys probably saw the Energy Harbor announcement this past week with a contract on site -- 10-year contract on site, I think, with a data center host customer. And I'm just curious how much are you looking at opportunities like that? And is that another way to potentially get kind of above-market hedges or essentially contracts? Can you talk about that? Joseph Dominguez : Sure, Steve. We have looked at it. And as you know, we announced at our Analyst Day, we did a deal at our combined cycle machines down in Texas, where we get incredibly strong interest from data center companies that come behind the fence line, and not only at the fossil plants in Texas, but, of course, taking advantage of the clean energy production at our nuclear plants and the high reliability that they get sitting behind the fence line there. We've held back a little bit on that. First, not interested in getting into more commodity risk around bitcoin and cryptocurrency. And honestly, I think all of the events that have transpired since Analyst Day kind of reinforce that sense of running the business and not having commodity exposure in terms of the production. So far, that's the way we've run things. We will look at contracts. But right now, I'm holding tight to see what happens in Washington because I want to see how that policy would work and interplay with any contract we might have with a data center behind the fence line. But is it an opportunity? Sure, it is. The Tier 0 data center market is going to do nothing but grow even if the cryptocurrency piece of it starts to stagnate a little bit, and those will be opportunities for us. But they're not things that we need to jump at with our nuclear plants. I think hydrogen and certainly how the production tax credit work are things that we need to see pretty clearly before we enter into long-term deals. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Zimbardo with Bank of America. Paul Zimbardo : I wanted to continue on Steve's line of questioning. Just more specifically around retail. How have those conversations gone? Not talking about the crypto data mine but just large commercial, industrial, the Microsofts of the world chief in recognizing that 0 carbon value. Is it about higher margins, more duration? Just if you could give a little more flavor on those conversations? James McHugh : Yes, sure. It's Jim. I can start. I think the conversations with our large commercial and industrial customers is going very well. They're very interested in sustainability products in general. We're talking to them about a number of things, the least of which I think is 24/7 and 365 that we've talked about. And our partnership with Microsoft on that product is going really well. We plan to pilot that product in this quarter coming out with some customers with the plan to be -- have commercial offering towards the second half of this year for those products. And a lot of our customers are asking for different flavors from a type of carbon-free matching and generation supply as well as what percentage of an hourly match you're looking for. And this platform that we're building with them is going to help us be able to supply that. We do tend to see in these types of customized solutions higher margins than the pure commodity sales when we're just selling energy supply contracts. So I think that's a great opportunity for us in general as these kind of customized sustainability products that they're looking for. There's been, with the high-energy markets, customers have certainly wanted to understand what the sustainability of these prices are, and they've cut down their terms on some deals, but the margin expansion has occurred for us, as Joe mentioned. So we've seen good results in terms of margin expansion, even just on the supply deal, and then the sustainability products have margin on top of that. Lots of interest. We hear feedback all the time and get feedback from our customers about how we can help them go ahead and meet their sustainability aspirations and what are part of their ESG goals. Joseph Dominguez : Yes, Paul, I think if I could complement Jim's points here, just, there's one piece of it that the customers are asking us for the sustainability products. The other piece is we see, obviously, starting with the U.S. government, a focus on load matching from a geography and a time standpoint. This is following a trend we've seen in Europe where regulators, customers, governmental entities and producers are all trying to, as I said, bring together the production of clean energy with the consumption of clean energy. If we're really going to move to a clean energy economy, we've got to make sure that those things match up, we send the right price signals for things like storage and other technologies that'll help us match these things up. So beginning with the executive order that President Biden signed earlier in this year, there's been a growing focus on load match. The other piece of that is what's going to happen out of the SEC process? What are people going to have to demonstrate to support their assertions around sustainability? Those are all big focus areas. But we've got to be ready with the technology to fill the niche to be able to deliver that value to our customers. And I mentioned this earlier in my comments, the RTOs, too, have to provide the industry with the data that tells us when renewable energy is being produced, when storage is being operated, and where it's happening relative to consumptive load. And many folks are surprised to learn that, right now, the RTOs don't offer that capability. So we've worked with PJM and others, and I complemented PJM's leadership for getting after this. But there are a lot of pieces that still need to come together for the 24/7 business to really develop it's kind of full muscularity. There are a lot of these regulatory questions that need to be answered, technical capabilities. But what we're trying to do is move this business, and we obviously have the support of supply but move this business into a position where it anticipates the continuing trend in the direction of matching load and generation, which we have to do if we're going to make a dent in the climate crisis. Paul Zimbardo : Okay, very comprehensive. And then one other, if I can, just in light of the $300 million higher total gross margin for 2023, is there a refresh view or a way to think about the Analyst Day disclosure about the $2.8 billion to $3.2 billion free cash flow for 2022 and 2023? Joseph Dominguez : Yes, Paul, it's a good question. We're not going to remark that annual guidance or the multiyear guidance on a quarterly basis. But certainly, I think we talked about the idea, we're confident in our capital budgets and our cost budgets. So there's more at the top line. You can probably translate it down to what it means for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : I actually have two questions, one for Dan, one for Joe. Dan, kind of a little bit of a modeling or just kind of trying to think about the gross margin line. When we see forward curves move up a lot in a year like 2023, safe to assume that you don't get to capture -- for the unhedged portion or uncontracted portion of the portfolio, you don't get to capture all of that benefit simply because some of your retail contracts they have prices set, or if they're floating, they have caps. And therefore, when we think about kind of moves in the curves for the unhedged portion of the portfolio that there's some portion of that move that just won't kind of trickle down to your bottom line? Daniel Eggers : Michael, the forward sales for our customer business are going to be reflected in our hedge values, right? So those prices are locked in, and you'll see that in the hedge percentage and in the [indiscernible] value. So when prices move, that does translate through. We provide sensitivities in the appendix pages that can be sent [indiscernible] the prices. Those work awfully well, to be totally honest. And so when you think about the movements in the market, I think that's a good way to help calibrate where we're heading. But otherwise, we should capture. I mean, sometimes when you get into the final year and the small percentages, there might be some seasonality where our hedges are. But generally speaking, when you think about a 23 with our position, you should expect that to carry through. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then, Joe, you made a comment in your opening remarks, you talked a lot about how some parts of the world, and especially Europe, may not have focused on the criticality of nuclear generation. I want to talk about that a little bit, and I'm curious for your feedback. One of Europe's largest nuclear generators has made no moves to retire plants. In fact, they're building plants. But they have faced given legacy issues with the plants or simply just aged, massive operational issues that have brought plants off-line and have reduced the amount of nuclear power in France, and that impacts the broader European market. I'm just curious how you think and your team thinks about your nuclear fleet and the U.S. nuclear fleet and the potential whereas these plants age, that operational performance, which has improved dramatically in the U.S. over the last 10, 15 years for the nuclear fleet, actually turns the other direction or faces headwinds or risks? Joseph Dominguez : Yes, that's a good one, Michael. I think what's aged at our clean energy centers is the name of late. I think when you look at just about every other piece of equipment inside we've updated them aggressively. You know from watching this company for a long time, and I know you have, that we've invested capital in these machines even during times where commodities were, frankly, at a real trough level. And so it's -- I think some folks who are neophytes in our business look at the age when the plant was commissioned and think the plant is that old. When in reality, the pumps, the main pieces of equipment, oftentimes steam generators and other things that need to be replaced have been replaced -- turbines, we've effectively rebuilt computer systems and electronic controls and cabling systems. So we've done a lot of that work. The situation in France is one that we've talked about we don't have. The weld issues were a characteristic of the design they use that we don't. The other thing that tends to happen in France is, when they have an issue, they shut down the entirety of the fleet. The U.S. regulators have taken a more structured approach to dealing with issues as they come up and allowing operators to address them during outages. And it's presumptuous for me to question the way the regulatory environment works in France. But honestly, it's a big part of the story there. But I feel very comfortable about the investments we've made in the plants. And I don't think it's like a coal plant, as an example, where everything is of the vintage that it was when the plant was originally built, and you see kind of this sliding performance and increasing cost profile. We haven't seen that. I think one good illustration of that, frankly, is when we did Peach Bottom, and we went from 60 to 80 years and through the NRC licensing process. What we found was that the investments we have been making to get the plants from 40 to 60 years had a lot more life than that incremental 20-year increase in their license life and carried us through all the way to 80. And I think that's illustrative that a lot of the changes that Bryan and his team are making, the technology improvements we've made now for decades are things that will carry us for many decades without expecting any diminishment in the performance of the unit, in fact just the opposite, or any increase in the cost of operating and maintaining the units, in fact just the opposite. So that's the way I would summarize it. Bryan, anything more to add? Bryan Hanson : I'd just add just much to Dan's chagrin, we invest in the plants like they're going to run forever, Joe. So we just stay attuned to that, right? There's nothing significant in the future that isn't already on our forecast around making these plants [indiscernible] years. Joseph Dominguez : There you go, Michael. You got a little bit of flavor of the discussion in our management team. Operator : Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : Joe, can you just maybe elaborate on your capital allocation opportunities? It's kind of in light of the potential improvement in cash flows, especially as we're kind of thinking about growth. Are you seeing more organic or inorganic opportunities as we think about kind of asset-level opportunities? And then conversely, does this kind of environment kind of make your fossil fuel assets more attractive as we think about sale opportunities. So maybe some thoughts on accelerating decarbonization here, for instance, with ERCOT or the Eastern gas assets? Joseph Dominguez : Yes, I would say our Texas assets are worth more now in terms of our own valuation than 3 months ago when we kicked the company off. but they're also producing more value. And they remain some of the lowest-emitting resources in the entirety of the Texas market. Look, I think we own the 2 best combined cycle machines in Texas, not only in terms of their operational performance and their emissions levels but something we haven't talked about in Texas, but probably should is the ability to withstand drought conditions because we don't need cooling water. They're air-cold machines. So not only are they very good, but they're air-cold machines. So if you have drought, they're going to be able to run through that. We like where we're positioned there. And while the work certainly isn't done, and the Texas Commission has acknowledged as much in terms of market design there, they've taken a lot of risk off the table, and the weatherization efforts there have worked. Point is, yes, I see the rising value of those things, but they're also delivering a lot of value to our customers in Texas right now. No hurry to give them up. I think the trend in terms of upward value is going to grow even stronger there. Not -- but that's probably where things are going to stop. We're not going to be a company that is going to be buying a lot of additional fossil fuel units. We've made that clear from an ESG commitment standpoint, and that's where things stand right now on that. Does that address your question on fossil? Shahriar Pourreza : No, it does. That's super helpful. And then just really last thing, sort of maybe be beating a dead horse here on the hedge profile, but maybe just give a little bit more color as we're thinking about the efforts in '24 and '25? I mean some of your peers were able to at least speak maybe directionally with a stated EBITDA range, and the scale of the opportunity seems really large? Joseph Dominguez : Look, I think we have a much bigger open position out there. And as Dan said, we try to give some good sensitivities. I think those are projectable, and the prices are pretty healthy out there. But I'm going to kind of stick to where Dan and I have been throughout the call. We'll have a period of time later on in the year when we can provide the update we'll provide updates in terms of our performance this year. I want to get through the summer. I want to be able to see how the fleet performs this summer. I want to then be able to factor in things like capital return. We owe you a big update at the end of the year on those sorts of things, and then we'll start wrapping in '24 to '25. I'm cognizant of what some of the other players in this space have said. Obviously, the improved pricing has lifted our boats there. But I want to shy away from being specific until we get some more ground under our feet. Dan, anything more to add there? Daniel Eggers : Yes -- no, I agree. I mean, charter, just you're looking at hedge percentages and that sort of thing in 24. It is a starting point, A, we gave you '24 at the Analyst Day. We talked about the increase since then. I've highlighted the fact that the Illinois CMC is about 27% of our output. So that's going to be hedged as it is. The New York assets given where prices are with the ZEC mechanism is going to look like that going forward. You can get a handle on kind of the building blocks of some of those pieces. But as Joe said, you do the math, there's still a lot of open exposure there on our generation link. And we think that's going to be an opportunity, particularly with the prices you're seeing in the Mid-Atlantic. Joseph Dominguez : And hopefully, Congress will act, and we'll have some sense of what that looks like for us at the same. So still a lot of moving pieces but a great start. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Joe Dominguez, President and CEO, for closing remarks. Joseph Dominguez : Well, just -- I just want to end up where I started off. Thank you all for your interest in the company. I'm thankful for the men and women who run this company. They've been doing a great job. Look forward to continuing this discussion in our next quarter, and frankly, continuing the good performance. Have a wonderful day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Constellation Energy Corporation Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded.  I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Emily Duncan, Vice President, Investor Relations. Vice President Duncan, you may begin. Emily Duncan : Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Constellation Energy Corporation's second quarter earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Joe Dominguez, Constellation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Eggers, Constellation's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Constellation senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning, along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Constellation's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we will discuss during today's call, contain forward-looking statements and estimates regarding Constellation and its subsidiaries that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's materials and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Constellation's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other circumstances and considerations that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures.  I'll now turn it over to the CEO of Constellation, Joe Dominguez. Joseph Dominguez : Thanks, Liz, for getting us started and for Vice President, Duncan for her preliminary remarks, otherwise known as Emily to all of us, and thank all of you for joining us this morning and for your continued interest in Constellation and our mission to provide reliable, clean energy to families and businesses across America 24/7, 365. Of course, as we talked this morning, all eyes are focused on Washington and the proposed Inflation Reduction Act, which would be clearly transformational for Constellation, both in terms of support for our clean energy nuclear assets as well as creating new opportunities for clean hydrogen production and fuels. I'll talk a little bit more about that in a minute. But Dan and I will focus most of our time on the excellent quarter we just completed and the strong numbers and operational performance across Constellation. As always, I want to begin with a shout out to our talented women and men who work at our plants, sell power to our customers and work in our corporate centers. I know a few of you listen in to these calls, and we want to thank you for everything you do for Constellation.  As you've no doubt read in the release on -- turning to Slide 5, Constellation posted a second quarter EBITDA of $603 million, and we reaffirm our full year guidance. Our balance sheet continues to give us a competitive advantage in the market, and customers are increasingly utilizing our platform of sustainability solutions, setting the stage for the launch of our 24/7 product. Dan will walk you through the financial results in his remarks, and I've asked him to spend a few minutes this morning reminding you of how our hedge program works.  Turning to Slide 6. As you know, our people have led the way on the development of policies that support the continued operation of baseload clean energy nuclear assets. They produce the bulk of America's emissions-free energy 24/7, 365 days a year. So we're pleased to have that a small role in the crafting of the historic federal energy bill that now we believe is on the cusp of success. It recognizes the vital role of clean nuclear energy. In that sense, the drafters of the IRA reached the same conclusion that many of our states have already reached, namely that without baseload nuclear assets, we don't stand a chance of achieving our climate objectives, our affordability goals, or the need to have reliable and resilient power on the grid that could withstand the extreme weather we increasingly face. The provisions in the IRA, I'm going to stumble through that a couple of times, not only support the continued operation of our assets, but create policy support, which, if extended, supports the 80-year license life that our assets could operate to, giving Constellation and its owners long-term clarity. Let me put this in context for you. By extending the licenses out to 80 years, our existing fleet of clean energy nuclear plants would have an operating life that is longer than any new renewable energy source that is going to be put on the grid this decade. But it's not just the longevity and the electricity side of it that excites us, it's what we could do to provide sustainable jobs for the future of our industry and ensure that those jobs create opportunities where opportunities are needed. Let me give you a little bit of a data point on this, just to tell you how extraordinary it is. From a job standpoint, extending the licenses at our plants to 80 years will create over 453 million people hours of work in high-paying jobs across the country, making the nuclear energy provisions of the IRA one of the largest creators of family-sustaining wages. The provisions of the IRA concerning clean hydrogen and, specifically, the ability of nuclear plants that earn both the nuclear PTC and the hydrogen PTC means that nuclear plants will become a key cog in clean hydrogen and sustainable fuels. States that took early action to preserve their nuclear plants should be able to receive credit on their -- from the PTC payments so that state consumers get the benefit of the federal programs, and work is underway to achieve that result. All told, here's how we see it. Passage of the IRA would be a win-win-win. It preserves and extends baseload clean energy resources that are vital to America's energy mix and our fight against the climate crisis. It preserves thousands and thousands of family-sustaining jobs and creates even more jobs. And it saves consumers' money in states that have preserved these assets. For you, our owners, it means this. It resets Constellation's value as a critical infrastructure company with strong and more predictable financial results, unique growth opportunities and long-term durability on par with anyone. Turning to Slide 7 and our generation highlights. Our fleet performed extremely well during the quarter. Let me start with the fossil and renewable fleet, really focusing on Texas. During the extreme heat in July, our plants ran as expected with minimal outages, all that were scheduled with ERCOT to occur at times that they would not impact the grid. Our generation fleet's performance reflects the investments we've made in Texas along the way and shows how well we are positioned as a portfolio in Texas to serve customers well during extreme heat and price volatility. Our clean energy nuclear plants at a 94.2 capacity factor and power and renewables achieved excellent results. And preliminarily, in July, our data indicates that our nuclear plants ran at over 98%. I remind you, this is different than any other resource out there in the market in terms of its ability to withstand temperature fluctuations and operate 24/7, 365. There is no other clean energy resource out there that does anything near that. In fact, when our nation saw unprecedented heat, the performance of the U.S. nuclear fleet as a whole save lives, providing baseload clean energy during times of record demand. And as we see the continued evolution of the stack and the move away from fossil fuels to more intermittent forms of generation, we think the importance of these assets will only grow over time.  Turning to our commercial business and the summary on Slide 8. It again performed very well during the quarter, with strong volumes of electricity and gas delivered to our customers. And we closed a number of deals providing carbon-free solutions to help customers meet their sustainability objectives. Customer renewals picked up significantly compared to the first quarter as we saw more customers come forward and be willing to interact. We doubled our renewal volume, making Q2 the best second quarter of renewals in 3 years. These renewals and our C&I business generally are an important part of our hedging strategy, which Dan will talk about in a second. In addition, we're seeing margin expansion across the retail and wholesale channels, recognizing the higher risks in the market due to volatility. We also executed some of our largest core deals to date. Core deals, as a reminder, help our customers meet their carbon and energy goals, but they also support the development of new and additional renewable megawatts being added to the grid. We've highlighted a number of the customers, Bank of America and P&C, in particular, who entered into very significant deals. In the future, our 24/7, 365 product will include nuclear energy as companies endeavor to reach even greater levels of sustainability by load matching their consumption with power produced at the same time. This will be a natural evolution of the core e product and other sustainability products that we have in the market.  In terms of our commitments, Slide 9 reminds you of what they are. We must, as a nation, do more to increase our clean generation and reduce emissions, and we have to help customers do the same thing. The transactions I just talked about with our business partners are part of leveraging our key advantages in helping them meet their sustainability goals. But as we talked about on Analyst Day, to provide all of our C&I customers with the information they need, we need to give them reports explaining where they are on their path to sustainability. And I'm pleased to say that at the end of this month, we're going to have that in the hands of every one of our customers. The other pillars of our carbon commitments are to grow our carbon-free generation to 95% of our output by 2030 and 100% by 2040, subject to policy and technology. That means we will be at zero emissions from generation by 2040, not, net zero, zero. And we're going to reduce our baseline operations-driven emissions to zero from a 2020 baseline. When we announced these commitments on Analyst Day, which, unbelievable, was just 6 months ago, we told you that we did it with the intent to set the bar in the industry, to be a leader. It's terrific now to see that other companies are following in our footsteps. And I commend those companies and their leadership. We have to keep pushing each other.  Turning to Slide 10. This is a slide that should be familiar to you, and I just want to walk through it quickly before I flip things over to Dan. We intend to deliver value to our shareholders through our capital allocation strategy. We are on track to provide you that update later in the year. We are committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating, which provides us a competitive advantage. And you've seen that advantage play its role in our success already in the 6 months of history of this company. We'll provide $180 million of annual dividend growing at 10%. We believe that there are other opportunities to grow our business organically and inorganically, and we'll seek those opportunities, provided that they exceed a double-digit return threshold. And if we don't find those opportunities, we're going to provide capital back to our owners through special dividend or share buybacks. Again, we're going to see what happens here with the IRA. We'll gauge the reaction in the market. That will inform the decisions, but we are committed to providing you that information this year. I've heard some chatter and questions out there that maybe that slips, not going to slip. We will provide that information to the market. Now let me flip it over to Dan. Daniel Eggers : Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 11. We had another strong quarter financially, earning $603 million in adjusted EBITDA. As expected, year-over-year EBITDA was slightly lower. We benefited from higher realized energy prices and lower nuclear fuel costs, driven by the absence of accelerated amortization of fuel at Byron and Dresden. This was primarily offset by lower capacity revenues from both cleared megawatts in the Midwest and lower prices across PJM and New York. Higher nuclear outage costs were driven primarily by a long refueling outage at Salem and additional maintenance during our Byron following the reversal of the retirement decision last fall. We are reaffirming our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.35 billion to $2.75 billion. As a reminder, we saw some favorability in the first half of the year by selling output from Byron and Dresden at higher prices after the retirement reversal due to the passage of the Clean Energy Jobs Act. As of June 1, Byron, Dresden and Braidwood all shifted to the first 12-month cycle under the 5-year CMC program, with revenue starting at $30.30 per megawatt hour. This price is lower than the prices we realized for Byron and Dresden in the first 5 months of this year. We plan to provide an update for our 2022 EBITDA guidance range on next quarter's call.  Turning to Slide 12. Since we launched in February, we've gotten a lot of questions from both new and legacy investors about our approach to hedging, including how and why we hedge. So I'm going to spend a few minutes to revisit our hedging program. From a business perspective, there are several reasons why we hedge as we do. First off, we serve 215 terawatt hours of retail and wholesale electric load annually in our commercial business, which accounts for the majority of our forward power sales. Our C&I customers generally sign contracts on a multiyear basis with an average term of at least 2 years that are often signed as long as 6 months before going into effect. Each year, 60 to 70 terawatt hours of these contracts come up for renewal, where we have a renewal rate around 80%, depending on the year. And then we typically win 1 out of every 3 new contracts where we seek to add customers. This leads to a fairly consistent stacking of contracts that effectively takes the shape of 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 over 3 years. Matching our generation output to these customer needs provides transaction efficiency and liquidity, particularly in the out-years. Second, the CMC mechanism in Illinois represents about 27% of our generation, creating a hedge for the next 5 years. With the run-up in power prices over the last 12 months, the contract prices are now below market and benefiting the Northern Illinois customers. But as you know, the Illinois plants would have shut down without the CMC law, so we would have been receiving no revenues at these sites without the law. Instead, we are now in a place to potentially extend the licensed lives of these strong dual-unit sites, improving both the duration and economic value of these assets. Third and foundationally, delivering on our financial covenants is of utmost importance, and our hedging program allows us to do that by providing certainty in the near-term earnings and cash flows. Improved visibility helps us in several ways by supporting the balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings, a competitive advantage clearly seen in these recently volatile commodity markets, and providing confidence in our capital allocation decisions, including long-term investment needs and return of capital to shareholders. We do have some flexibility within our hedging program to be opportunistic when we see attractive prices or pull back when we don't. So we'll manage the portfolio accordingly to capture the most possible value as we see market conditions. You've heard this from us since our Analyst Day, meeting our financial commitments is paramount to us, and our hedging program allows us to meet these commitments, delivering value for our shareholders.  Now turning to Slide 13. We provided an update to our gross margin disclosures, which is marked to June 30, 2022, for prices and positions. Looking at the table, you can see that the total gross margin for 2022 is unchanged from March 31 as we are nearly 100% hedged across the major regions. Open gross margin is up significantly since the first quarter earnings call due to the increase in power prices across all major regions, offset by the mark-to-market of hedges since we are effectively fully hedged. The commercial team continues to perform well and executed $100 million of power new business during the quarter. In 2023, total gross margin is up $200 million since last quarter to $8.15 billion. Open gross margin is up $500 million, partially offset by mark-to-market of hedges and execution of $50 million of power new business during the quarter. Across all regions, we capitalized on higher prices during the quarter. Executing sales at price levels well above those of previously executed hedges, we are now 88% to 91% hedged across our portfolio. We've all watched the dramatic increases in forward gas and power curves over the past 12 to 18 months. But an interesting phenomenon also worth noting is the steep backwardation in the curves across our regions, with 2022 and '23 significantly higher than the out-years. There was around $30 a megawatt hour of backwardation in the forward groups at NI Hub and West Hub between 2022 and '24. This steepness in the curve is unique. Looking back at history, the past 3 years' backwardation would have been about $3 to $5 per megawatt hour. And the curves are pretty flat when we look back to the 3 years before that. I talked about the importance of our retail customers a few moments ago. Many of our retail power customers sign multiyear contracts at a fixed price, providing them with the visibility and certainty they need to manage their businesses and budgets. However, when combining a fixed-price contract with a steep backwardation in the commodity curve, we've been running into some margin pressure in the near term as we deliver at a lower-than-market price now and then make up for make up for the pressure in the out-years when the cost to serve is then lower than the fixed price contract. We are managing through this headwind, but wanted to flag since these are different -- use a different market conditions than we've encountered before. I should stress, as Joe pointed out, we have seen some margin improvement this year. There's a little bit of a timing phenomenon, but operationally, this is a good outcome for us.  Turning to the financing and liquidity update on Slide 15. Our credit metrics remain very strong. We have a BBB- rating at S&P with positive outlook and a Baa2 at Moody's with a stable outlook, and our metrics are 10% to 20% higher than our downgrade thresholds. As a reminder, we have already retired or paid down nearly $2.5 billion of long-term debt and term loans this year, completing our debt paid out for the next 2 years. And as Joe mentioned, the value of having an investment-grade balance sheet continues to grow and provide competitive advantages in today's market. We continue to be in a strong liquidity position, with more than $2 billion in unused capacity and a cash balance of $800 million as of June 30. We have received many questions about our pension since the separation. As of June 30, our pension-funded status is just over 93%, which has improved since year-end due to a combination of the $192 million pension contribution we made in February and the positive impact from higher discount rates on the liability that have collectively more than offset the impact of asset returns. As a result of the higher-funded status, we've been derisking the asset mix of the portfolio, which has helped to mitigate the impact of negative equity returns in the first half of this year. We will run a full remeasurement of our pension, OPEB and related trust assets at year-end in normal course. Any change that differ to the assumptions previously embedded in our projections are recognized over time rather than immediately in our financials. Therefore, such changes will have no impact to our current year earnings. Our financial strength sets us apart from others in the market. This strength provides us with more opportunities to transact in volatile markets, where margins expand as risk is more appropriately reflected in pricing, and we are better positioned to service our customers, all while meeting any additional collateral postings without the need for additional liquidity and those associated costs.  I'd like to now turn the call back to Joe for his closing remarks. Joseph Dominguez : Thanks, Dan. I want to just close by talking a little bit and summarizing Constellation's value proposition. It was a decade ago that we were really starting this discussion about the importance of preserving the nuclear plants. And I think just so much has changed during that period of time. And really, a lot has changed here in the last year or 2, where you've seen some of the horrible policy decisions that in closing these plants have an impact on electricity prices, reliability and, of course, the fight on the climate crisis. So it's just so great to see this package coming together in Washington. And we're confident it will pass, and it's going to really change America. So it's a great thing. We just think we're a unique company that cannot be replicated. We own 25% of the U.S. nuclear fleet. And we produce 10% of the carbon-free antigen, nearly twice as much as the next largest carbon-free generator. And these plants could run for 80 years, well beyond 2050, in most cases. We provide power to nearly 23% of all competitive C&I customers in the U.S., 3/4 of the Fortune 100. This puts us in a position to meet the growing demand for customer-driven carbon-free energy and sustainability solutions. We think we're the best operator of nuclear plants in the country, and the metrics back that up. We thrive in times of volatility, as both Dan and I discussed earlier. We generate strong free cash flow through our best-in-class operations, retail and wholesale platforms, and we support clean energy across the country with a good focus on cost and reliability. We have a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit rating is extremely valuable, and we deliver value to our shareholders through disciplined capital allocation.  I'll now turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first participant to come to the microphone will be Steve Fleishman, and Steve is with Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : Well, Joe, you even got the operator excited. So I think that's the first. Joseph Dominguez : Well, we thank Liz for that. Enjoy the show. She's a shareholder. Steven Fleishman : Yes. So this bill's not passed yet, and so I just want to just get a little more color on your confidence, such confidence that it's going to get done, and also make sure that the corporate min tax provisions would not impact Constellation. Joseph Dominguez : Yes. Let's do it backwards. Dan, why don't you talk about the AMT first? Daniel Eggers : Yes, Steve, thanks for the question. So when we talk about our cash tax exposure, I guess, number one, certainly, we're going to be over the $1 billion pretax earnings threshold as we look forward. So we'll qualify it in that sense. We've told you that we expect that our cash tax rate to be moving up from a modest payer this year to be a more meaningful payer next year and the years beyond. When we look at '23, our cash tax rate would be above the AMT under all circumstances. We would expect to be a cash taxpayer, absent the PCC, once that goes in effect in '24, we'll manage the credits to cover our tax liabilities and use the transfer market to monetize those that wouldn't fit and rate the AMT construct. Joseph Dominguez : Thanks, Dan. And Steve, as to your question on the IRA, it's -- look, there's just a lot of work that's been done, and we're pretty close. At this point, what we're seeing is probably what everybody is seeing who's following the bill. Strong progress, getting managed on board was key. Senator Sinema is out there, reports yesterday on some, what I would describe, maybe not others, but what I would describe as fairly modest changes to the bill. And so if that all holds true and the parliamentarian gets the work done, we see a pathway to passage here in August. And then, of course, they'll go to the house when they come back from recess. But there's no reason, at this point, that we could see not to be confident.  Kathleen, do you have anything to add? Kathleen Barron : No, I think that's right. I mean, I think, Steve, you've followed us for long enough. You've seen hurdles get cleared over the last couple of months. There are a couple of remaining, as Joe said, the problem with is getting to work on the tax title and the energy title. And we just -- we have a couple of more days here to let the Senate continue doing their work, but we're getting close. Operator : So the next question is [ tops wrapped ] up is going to be from Paul Zimbardo at Bank of America. Paul Zimbardo : Wanted to touch a little bit on the cost side of the business. Just given the inflationary pressures, are the guidances -- the multiyear guidance that you put out for O&M, maintenance capital, still good ones to focus on? Or are you starting to see some pressure on those numbers? Joseph Dominguez : Paul, I think we're -- like everybody else, we're starting to see some labor pressure. But we benefit from a few things here. We have -- for the O&M at our plants, we have long-term agreements to support the operation of the plants. And they have built in escalators at 2% to 3%. And that's something, obviously, we had already factored into our plan. So we -- that being probably one of the largest drivers of our cost is locked in. Most of our big labor agreements are also locked in, in some cases, through 2027 at 2.5%. So we're not immune in this environment to inflationary pressures, but we find ourselves in a pretty strong position. I'll also add, we carry -- and this is one of our strengths, we carry a lot of the nuclear parts inventory in-house so that we could quickly recover from maintenance events. And that's a benefit because it's already bought. It's already on the sidelines here. Dan, anything more to add on that? Daniel Eggers : I think that's right. We'll keep an eye on all the pieces, but certainly, between the labor deals that we have and the supply contracts, the delays that significantly played out at this point. Joseph Dominguez : Yes. I think we feel comfortable, Paul, is the bottom line. Paul Zimbardo : Okay. Great. And if I could quickly ask just about the nice uptick in new customer win rates, renewal rates, just how those conversations have evolved now that commodity prices have proven pretty sticky, to be higher than before? Joseph Dominguez : Yes. Well, I'm going to ask Jim McHugh to weigh in, but I think you just -- you've actually nailed it. I think in the early days, and we certainly saw this in the first quarter, renewal rates were down because our customers quite naturally were wondering if this is a short-term blip and things were going to kind of cascade backwards to where prices were before. And now we see a lot more renewables. Now some of that's just time-driven. Some of these contracts are coming up. Customers have to make the decision. But I think the conversations we're having, Jim, right, are that customers now understand we've had a transformation in energy pricing, and they're locking in deals. James McHugh : Yes, I think that's right, Paul. From a pure locking-in commodity perspective, they have to get their budget certainty, too, right? So they're coming up on their renewals, and they're coming up on when they need to kind of get their deals, unable to drag their feet for a little bit. But it's pretty apparent, I think, to them and to us that we're kind of in a different energy complex right now, and they're more willing to lock in. We saw that during the second quarter with the increased renew rates. We also saw increased -- during the second quarter, the terms stretched out a little bit longer from where they were in the first quarter. So both of those, I think, are indicators of what Joe just mentioned. And of course, these same customers are also talking to us about the future products, too, because they have an eye on their sustainability needs and their energy footprint. So those conversations are generally going pretty well right now. Operator : Next up to ask a question is Shar Pourreza with the Guggenheim. Jamieson Ward : It's actually James for Shar. Can you hear me? Joseph Dominguez : Yes. Jamieson Ward : So Joe, I guess, I wanted to start with your comments on growth in capital allocation and how that kind of ties into the IRA potentially passing this summer. Would that change your views at all around inorganic nuclear growth? And are you seeing any opportunities out there right now? Joseph Dominguez : I think I've talked a little bit about this before on last quarter's call. I always thought that with the IRA out there, and we were certainly seeing this, it was just going to be hard to pin down valuation. Sellers were always going to want to value the IRA. And we wanted to see the certainty, even though we were cautiously optimistic, and we saw the progress. So I think what the IRA does is narrows the bid-ask spread by effectively providing a strong price floor under the nuclear units at over $40 a megawatt hour. So that allows us to have conversations that we haven't had before. In terms of getting into specifics here, you all know that we're focused on acquiring assets, and that's part of the inorganic growth strategy, if the price makes sense to us. And if you see any nuclear plant transacting, I think it's fair to guess that Constellation is going to be involved in that discussion. But I wouldn't describe the pace as increasing or not. I think right now, people are just waiting for this to get done. And then I think maybe revisiting that question in the third quarter, it'd be interesting to see if there's an uptick in activity. But I think folks have to digest this. They have to understand what it means for their business. And then I think there'll be an opportunity to have a landscape where assets will become available. Jamieson Ward : Excellent. And I guess, just sort of on the hydrogen side of the legislation, the opportunity here as we look at the capital allocation, could you actually start spending growth capital in '23? Or is it really just something that has some technical [indiscernible] compared to the pilots? Joseph Dominguez : My thought on that would be that anything we spend in '23 would be relatively modest compared to the amount of cash that we'll be generating as a business. And I think capital in that area would probably scale up more meaningfully in '24. Operator : Next wonderful and exciting question comes from James Thalacker at BMO Capital Markets. James Thalacker : Just a real quick question, just sticking on the supply side. A lot of people are focused on the pricing side. But just wondering, I noticed that just yourself and Duke had signed LOIs with Global Laser Enrichment over the last couple of months. And just wondering if the -- there's been increased focus on energy security and domestic supply production, how do you guys see bringing uranium back in terms of both production as well as enrichment here in the U.S., and how this technology might sort of play into that? I know it's going to be longer dated. Joseph Dominguez : Yes. I think in terms of a U.S. strategy, I think policymakers are right to be focused on incentivizing more production capability in the U.S. I think that's a pretty exciting technology. Bryan Hanson, who runs our fleet, is here. And maybe, Bryan, you could add a little bit of color. Bryan Hanson : Yes. I just said it's important for the U.S. to reestablish itself as an international leader in enrichment services. As you know, we currently have very modest amounts in the U.S. today. So I think based on this desire, we're seeing a lot of new innovations come about, both in GLE, as you referenced, and a couple of other companies that are also looking at the United States to expand enrichment services. And we want to be an active part of that. James Thalacker : And just as a follow-up, I know that these things are going to probably take longer than probably most investors' attention span. But as you think about bringing back sort of domestic, not only supply, but also enrichment to the U.S., how long of a time frame do you think before we're kind of we've wrestled back a large chunk of what sort of currently offshore? Bryan Hanson : Yes, I think most of the manufacturers think somewhere after 2026, out in the 2028 to 2030 period. And again, through our contracting and contracts that we have, we're -- again, we're hedged for multiple years out in the future and feel comfortable where we are in our fuel position today. Operator : The next question comes from David Arcaro at Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro : I was wondering, just if the -- if you get the nuclear PTC, is there a like baseline EBITDA and cash flow level that you would have in mind as to -- if all of your plants would have received the PTC into that low 40s per megawatt hour level, what that would mean for the kind of stable, low-risk and derisked piece of the EBITDA profile? Joseph Dominguez : David, appreciate your question. We're working through that. The legislation still hasn't gone. We want to see the final language. Even after the legislation is done, there's going to be some elements of it that will be subject to treasury interpretations, where we're going to need some guidance to settle it out. It has -- the first year it's really effective for us is '24, which is outside of our guidance at this point. But we'll be working through that, quite obviously, and have devoted a good deal and thought to it. But at this point, I don't think we have all the data points yet to say. And secondarily, I just -- I don't want to be in the middle of this legislative discussion talking about profits until we see bills and see how this really translates to our business. David Arcaro : Understood. That's fair. I thought I'd give it a shot. And then you've mentioned some retail margin pressure that you're seeing this year. I was just wondering if you might be able to quantify that further as to how much that's impacting the EBITDA and how it might kind of come back in a positive way on the back end out in 2024? Daniel Eggers : Yes, Dave, I think [ that hard ] point, we just kind of highlight that this is a trend that we haven't seen historically, right? We reiterated our guidance comfortably for the year. So we still feel good that this is going to be a little bit in the friction of the year. So I wouldn't over rotate in it by any means, the origination, as Joe pointed out. We're having good margins on the business as customers are coming back, and they're looking at getting risk priced into those contracts. So we feel good about it. I guess a little bit of something we're keeping eye on for this year, maybe dragging in next year a little bit, but nothing has changed in our disclosures at this point. David Arcaro : Okay. Got you. That's helpful. And then just lastly, I was wondering if you could talk to how the 2024 hedge level might be shaping up just in terms of how much you might have layered on over the course of the quarter. Would it be similar to what we've added for the 2023 year? Or any color there would be helpful. Joseph Dominguez : Yes, David, I'm going to ask Jim to jump in and answer that. But just not to be nitpicky, but in your prior question, you talked a little bit about how we levelize prices and that we might get the value back in outer-years. There's no might about it. What we're doing is just smoothing the price trajectory for customers and levelizing that really over a period of years. We will get it back in the outer-years but by no means are we signaling that this has lost money and that there's any chance to it. Jim, why don't you cover the last question? James McHugh : Thanks, Joe. As it pertains to the 2024 hedging question, I'll kind of highlight where we are and what's been going on in the portfolio. I want to basically -- I want to start with just a reminder that, like Dan said in his opening remarks about having the CMC structure, that starts us out at about a 27% hedge level. And the way the -- in addition to that, the way the New York ZEC rate setting mechanism is happening right now with where prices are. That's also hedging a piece of our portfolio because as prices go up, we're able to -- we're offsetting the increase in generation value with the ZEC mechanism moved into. So those are 2 things that start our portfolio already hedging a bit ahead of unratable amount. But to give you some context of where we are, we had talked at the Analyst Day, we gave a number that we were 52% hedged in calendar year '24. In the last quarter, during Q1, we talked about we added a similar amount of hedges to calendar year '24 that we added to calendar year '23. So that would get you to the mid-60, like the 65% hedge level. Well, this quarter, we added right -- again, right about a ratable amount or slightly less overall. And we're sitting around the 70% hedge number right now. So there's 30% of our portfolio that's still open, participating in the market conditions. What we've been doing recently is just adding some of those incremental hedges as we've seen this gross margin moving higher with the forward markets and taking some opportunities to lock some of that in to achieve what Dan talked about during the opening remarks of the call, where we're looking at creating reliability and durability and stability in the gross margin EBITDA projections out there. So we have a 70% hedge number right now. The activity in hedging is coming from our customer business, primarily it's coming from -- or with the forward markets and taking some opportunities to lock some of that in to achieve what Dan talked about during the opening remarks of the call, where we're looking at creating reliability and durability and stability in the gross margin EBITDA projections out there. So we have a 70% hedge number right now. The activity in hedging is coming from our customer business, primarily it's coming from customer sales where we make those margins on the energy that we're selling. So it's been a good story for calendar year '24. Operator : So we have time for 1 more question, and that's going to go to Jonathan Arnold. Jonathan is with Vertical Research Partners. Jonathan Arnold : Guys, can you hear me? Joseph Dominguez : We can, Jonathan. Jonathan Arnold : Just a quick question to sort of ease off of the starting to talk about 2024 and hedging. As you read the IRA legislation as it's currently drafted, what is going to drive the PTC most likely? Is it going to be a market clearing the busbar type price of the unit? Or is it going to be some number that reflects hedges you have on? And then how do you think that would be determined? Or just any insight you can give on how you think that's going to work. Joseph Dominguez : Yes, Jonathan, we think it could be either. And that's the way that treasury will ultimately interpret it, either as a hedge or you could do it -- you can take it the spot. But that's -- when I talked earlier about one of the treasury interpretations that we're going to need in the long term to really add certainty, that's one of the things that we're going to look at. The reason -- look, the reason we think that the hedge should be one of the means of setting the value of the PTC is this, the way we've always done business. And in point of fact, if the IRS was telling us that the only way to guarantee the PTC at its full value is not the hedge and take everything to spot, then we would have to effectively stop participating to a great degree in some of these utility procurements that go out multiple years. And with 33-plus percent of the energy that's being sold in PJM as an example, coming from nuclear, without the participation of nuclear baseload in these auctions, our customers, at the end of the day, families and businesses won't be able to get the certainty through their hedges. So there's a number of examples where Treasury has used hedge values for for tax purposes. We think those will apply here. There's a lot of good reasons why it should apply to, again, facilitate these load options that all of the utilities seem to have and warrant. And those points will be made to treasury. And I think treasury will certainly accept it at the end of the day, but it's not a done deal just yet. It's one of these open issues. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. So the bill is sort of not definitive and something to work out after the after passage effectively. Joseph Dominguez : I think that's fair, right? I think the way we read the language is it's open to either. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. And then maybe I just want to make sure I have what you said on capital allocation.  I got a buzz on the line, do you say later in the year, was something or any more specific than that? Joseph Dominguez : What I said, Jonathan, I apologize if it was on our end. But what I was saying is this, with the IRA, if that were to pass and be enacted in September, we'd want to see a period of time to see how the market reacts. Is the market, in our view, treating us fairly? And does it reflect the enormous transformational value that the bill would have on our business? And so that will drive how we utilize our cash, and that may change the option. So I think we'll see this thing in September. We'll see fairly quickly how the market reacts. And what I was saying is that we are committed to providing that information before the end of the year. Is that going to happen on the third quarter call or sometime between the third and fourth quarter call? I don't know yet. We haven't made that judgment, but we're going to provide that information. And the year is going to be 2022 in which we're going to provide it. Jonathan Arnold : And then maybe if I could just sort of follow up on that, the question David asked about the baseline under the nuclear PTC. Do you think you'll kind of give the market an indication of that as part of this price discovery process? Or sort of let us figure that out and then decide what to do on capital allocation, depending on book value, which is what I'm hearing? Joseph Dominguez : Yes. I think in terms of the long-term value of our assets and our business, the market is going to be able to figure that out fairly readily. I know that the treasury interpretation on the reference point for setting the PTC is an issue, and certainly, in the earlier year of the program, perhaps it's an issue. But in the long term, you're going to be able to look at the number of megawatts we produce and evaluate it against low 40s megawatt hour price, and you're going to have a pretty good sense of what the value of these companies can be. Operator : That does conclude our Q&A session of the event. You may all over to Joe or Dan. I think Dan, may be. Daniel Eggers : Well, Liz, I want to thank you again for starting the call and your colorful remarks throughout and for all the folks who have listened in and the great questions we've received. So thank you very much, everybody. Have a great day. Operator : All right. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Constellation Energy Corporation Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Emily Duncan, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin. Emily Duncan : Thank you, Amy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Constellation Energy Corporation's third quarter earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Joe Dominguez, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Eggers, Constellation\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Constellation's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning, along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of the Constellation\u2019s website. The earnings release and other matters, which we will discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates regarding Constellation and its subsidiaries that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during the call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Constellation's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other circumstances and considerations that may cause results to differ from the management's projections, forecasts, and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted EBITDA, and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. I'll now turn it over to the CEO of Constellation, Joe Dominguez. Joe Dominguez : Thanks, Emily. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I especially want to thank the new owners of Constellation to the call. It\u2019s gratifying to see the continuing and expanding interest in our new company from all parts of the world. We had a strong quarter delivering adjusted EBITDA of 592 million, which is a result of the strong operations and performance across the business. Dan will go through some of the details in his remarks and we look forward to your questions at the end. As always, I want to start with a shout-out to the talented women and men who help us to run this company and who listen into these calls. Thanks for everything you do. [Plainly] [ph], the biggest news during the quarter was the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which recognizes the vital role that clean carbon free nuclear plays in meeting the country's climate objectives. We've had a little time now to absorb the transformational impact of the IRA to us and in our minds does four big things. First, it helps us to attract and retain talent. This business is about human capital and it's hard to keep people when you're constantly talking about plant closures. Thankfully, we're done with that. Second, and to the same point, the IRA keeps the plants open for our communities and for America. And it's not just about the carbon benefits. It's about the local air pollution reductions. It's the jobs and economic benefits, especially in hard hit areas of our nation, and it's about electric reliability and affordability. We've said this before, but it bears constant repeating. The most important energy commodity in the world today is a reliable zero emission clean energy megawatt. I don't care how you make it, but producing affordable clean energy that shows up whenever and wherever you want is the foundation of any modern energy system that deals with climate. The PTC begins to recognize the value of that scarce commodity and we make more of it than anyone in America. Third, the IRA provides our owners consistent returns by creating downside protection through commodity cycles with inflation protection. We wanted to take a minute this morning highlighting the inflation protection mechanism of the PTC, given the concern that all businesses and investors rightfully have about inflation at this moment in time. Our thinking is that inflation will be difficult to control for many reasons and that the Fed's stated goal of getting to 2% long-term inflation will be a significant challenge. Fortunately, the PTC automatically adjusts higher in these scenarios as you could see from the slide. In a 2% case, prices go to about $51 over the term of the PTC, and $57 a megawatt hour in a 3% case. This gives us great confidence in our ability to favorably manage longer-term inflationary risks. Fourth, the IRA gives us an interesting opportunity to grow by operating our plants and earn an enhanced PTC for incremental megawatts, to grow by investing in hydrogen and to grow by extending the lives of our assets to 80 years. I'll talk about a couple of these more in a moment. [In some] [ph], the IRA gives our investors a very unique investment opportunity. A clean energy investment with unlimited upside to higher commodity prices, downside commodity risk protection provided by the U.S. government, unique growth opportunities in hydrogen, life extensions, and upgrades and structural inflationary risk protection.  We were pleased to see that the S&P recognized that the IRA provides significant benefits as part of its reassessment of Constellation's risk profile and upgraded us to BBB, while maintaining a positive outlook. A good investment credit rating is more important now than ever. If I can turn to Slide 6, I think this is a slide I'm pretty excited to talk about. What it depicts is the life of our existing assets. The blue is the current license life of our fleet. And as you can see, it starts to dwindle down beginning in 2030s and phases-out by 2050. You could see in some of the other colors here, certain life extensions that we've already filed for or obtained in the case of a few of our plants. The green that's shown on the chart is the additional life that we will get by going to 80 years. And just to provide some context on how big that opportunity is for Constellation in America, just extending the life of Constellation's clean energy units, not all the units in the country, just ours, just extending ours will create as much clean power for America to fight the climate crisis as all of the renewable energy that's been built in America over the last 40 years. And it won't cost hundreds of billions of dollars to make it happen. It's there for us at a modest cost through the NRC life extension process. Last week, we announced that we will be asking the NRC to renew the licenses of Clinton and Dresden units in Illinois for an additional 20 years, allowing these plans to serve America to the middle of the century and beyond. The NRC process for renewals expected to take us about four years and it will allow Clinton to run to 2047 and Dresden to run to about 2050. This is Clinton's initial license renewal and with a subsequent renewal it has the potential to operate until 2067. With continued policy support, we believe that we'll be able to renew the licenses at all of our plants, which would mean parts of our existing fleet would be providing carbon free always on generation well into the [2060\u2019s] [ph] at least. Once license life is extended, our clean energy nuclear plants would have an operating life that is longer than any existing renewable energy source and in fact longer than any new renewable energy source that would be put into service in the next decade, but this isn't just about competition with other technologies. We need every zero carbon resource and license renewal is a hugely important part of the [Climate Tool Chest] [ph]. It gives our owners a unique investment opportunity for the long run. Turning to Slide 7, I want to talk a little bit about hydrogen. Like many others, we think that clean hydrogen will play an incredibly important role in mitigating climate change and reaching sectors of our energy and transportation industrial uses that can't be reached through traditional electrification. Hydrogen could be used to create sustainable aviation fuels for airplanes, reduce emissions, and steel manufacturing and other industrial process, for fuel cells that provide power for long haul trucking and even to create fertilizers and other clean agricultural products. The opportunities are virtually limitless, and the clean hydrogen provisions of the IRA, specifically the ability to earn both a nuclear and hydrogen PTC means that nuclear plants can become COGS in the clean hydrogen market. As you know, we will be the first to produce hydrogen from nuclear energy through our pilot project at Nine Mile Point. Last week, we also announced that we are a member of the Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen or MachH2, which will be applying for a hydrogen hub funding from the DOE. We see Constellation participating in three ways as shown on this slide. First, hydrogen by wire. They are thinking about customers that are already using hydrogen at their industrial processes and want to use clean hydrogen. In order to get the full tax credit, they're going to need to prove that they're powering their electrolyzers with clean energy, and that will translate into contract opportunities with us to provide cleaning 24/7 power through our Constellation business. The second opportunity we have is to co-locate electrolyzers and make hydrogen byproducts at our sites. And the third opportunity is to power fuel cells with hydrogen and that's what we're testing at Nine Mile along with NYSERDA and the DOE. There, you store hydrogen at times where the grid doesn't need power and then you run that hydrogen back through a fuel cell and produce energy to the grid when it's needed. The key thing we're doing here is exploring optionality, so that we could use these three strategies interchangeably. And one of the technical things that we're trying to work on is being able to move from producing energy and putting it on the grid to making hydrogen with that energy and going back and forth in a matter of 10 minutes to 15 minutes. That way we'll always be able to support the grid when the grid needs energy and when the grid doesn't need the excess energy, we could be making hydrogen. As we turn to Slide 8, I want to talk a little bit about our operations. Our power and renewable fleet performed well with power dispatch match rate of 98.8% and a renewable capture rate of 95.7%. Our nuclear fleet ran well, but not perfect at 96.4% in its capacity factor. Our fleet will end the year with industry leading performance. Performance that has led continually for a significant period of time now. We continue to operate at a capacity factor that is about 4% better than the industry average. And to put that in context for you, on an open position at the PTC price port, a 4% higher capacity factor for our fleet translates into over $300 million of incremental revenue. Turning to Slide 9 in our commercial business highlights. As I mentioned at the top, our commercial business performed well during the quarter with strong volumes of electricity and gas delivered to our customers and we closed deals that provide carbon free solutions to our customers. We delivered 56 terawatt hours of electricity during the quarter and we continue to see strong renewal and win rates across both our electric and gas businesses. Those win rates are reflected on the chart. We reached an agreement with the City of Chicago in collaboration with Swift Current Energy to purchase 100% clean renewable energy by 2025. As part of the agreement, the city will source its large energy uses with 300 megawatts of a new solar facility under construction in Illinois, and will procure renewable energy credits for its remaining uses. This agreement will help Chicago lead the way in the fight against the climate crisis and yet is another example of how we're helping our customers meet their sustainability goals. Finally, I want to spend a moment on used fuel. Turning to Slide 10, we often talk about the fact that nuclear has many ESG attributes. It's got the lowest lifecycle carbon emissions of any technology. It produces more carbon free power on less land than any other source because of its incredible power density. It provides unprecedented, reliable, and affordable energy to all communities because we think reliability is just as important to society as sustainability. It provides family sustaining jobs in many core communities across the country and has a strong industry safety culture. And as I mentioned through innovation, we could use that clean energy to decarbonize other sensors with hydrogen fuels, but one of the questions we often get from investors is about spent fuel or as we prefer to call it used fuel. So, I want to spend a few minutes talking about how fuel safety \u2013 how fuel safely and secured and stored at our sites. First, I don't think we get appropriate credit for this, but we're the only large scale energy producing technology that takes full responsibility for all its waste, plans for its eventual disposal, and we pre-fund all of our [plants] [ph] retiring obligations. That's not true for any other energy source, whether it's fossil fuels or renewable energy. We know where every gram of spent fuel is located and how it is packaged, tagged, and tracked. In terms of volume, nuclear energy is extremely dense and produces less waste by volume than any other type of energy. For context, all of the spent nuclear fuel produced in the United States from the dawn of the civilian nuclear era. When President Eisenhower gave his famous 1953 Atoms for Peace speech, until now all of it could fit inside a Super Walmart. By comparison, a single coal plant generates as much waste by volume in one hour as the entire U.S. nuclear power industry has produced during its entire history. Now, after our fuel is used to produce energy, it's placed in water [indiscernible] down. Then it's placed in these 16-foot stainless steel containers that are shown on the picture in this slide, and there the material can be safely stored for hundreds and hundreds of years. These containers are designed to withstand earthquakes, storms, and projectiles, and they're completely passive, meaning they don't need any power or any source of energy to continue to operate. There's never been any unplanned radiation release from the containers and they emit less radiation than a frequent flyer received in a year. The safe storage of these materials gives us time to finally resolve disposal or to reuse the fuel as many technologies now proposed to do. Look, it's not a perfect solution, but there are no perfect solutions in the energy sector. and we're extremely proud of what the industry has done. And we wanted to share this perspective because we know how important it is many of our owners. Now, with that, let me flip it over to Dan. Dan Eggers : Thank you, Joe, and good morning everyone. Starting with Slide 11, we earned $562 million in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, which was in-line with our expectations. The commercial business continued to produce strong results, benefiting in the quarter from favorability and customer load serving obligations, effective portfolio management, and some successful load options. This favorability more than absorbed the drag from the shaping issues we discussed last quarter, as well as higher bad debt expense with our residential customers. On the generation front, we ran into higher unplanned outages during the quarter, which Joe pointed to. Anytime we are running the plants, whether planned or unplanned, is an opportunity loss, particularly at these prices. And with the run up this summer in spot power prices, replacement power costs were much higher than they've been in recent years, which impacted our results even with overall output not down all that much. For context, everyday a unit was out this summer, cost between $1.5 million and $2 million a day in replacement power, compared to only $0.5 million to $1 million a day in prior years. Turning to Slide 12, let me start with the commodity market. [Spot natural gas] [ph] prices remained volatile, but somewhat higher during the third quarter, driven by a record hot summer and associated demand, higher competing fuel prices with international demand, and below average inventory. Spot power prices have followed the increase in gas prices, while energy demand also reflected the warmer than normal weather and post-COVID load recovery seen especially in Texas. ERCOT saw its warmest July on record, PGM and MISO each set records for their single warmest day, and NYISO had its second warmest day on record. Turning to forward prices. During the third quarter, we saw increases largely on the same factors driving spot markets, elevated natural gas prices, higher coal and emissions prices, having anticipated supply impacts of announced coal retirements. We continue to see backwardation in the 2024 and 2025 [curves] [ph] compared to 2023, although the steepness in backwardation has started to ease. Since the end of the quarter, forward prices for natural gas and power have remained volatile and this is likely to continue given an underlying tight gas market both domestically and globally. Uncertainty over winter weather here and in Europe and a potential return in the [Freeport LNG] [ph] facility during the fourth quarter. Moving to the gross margin table, 2022 total gross margin increased $50 million from the prior quarter as a result of the strong performance of our commercial team. Open gross margin is up $50 million as a result of higher power prices in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic, offset by the mark-to-market of hedges since we are effectively fully hedged this year. During the quarter, we executed $100 million of new business between power and non-power. In 2023, total gross margin increased by $100 million to $8.25 billion. Open gross margin is up 1.8 billion, largely offset by the mark-to-market of hedges and $150 million of power and non-power new business was executed during the quarter. We continue to sell at higher prices than in previous quarters and are now 92% to 95% hedged across the portfolio in 2023. When we look forward, we're excited about the structural price support the PTC will provide our generation fleet for nine years starting in 2024 through 2032. That said, recent prices have generally been well above the PTC drive support levels and we have and plan to continue selling power to capture prices in excess of the PTC4 values and to support our customer business. Turning to Slide 13. We are reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance mid-point of $2.55 billion and narrowing our range to $2.45 billion to $2.65 billion. We're happy with our operational performance this year and are confident in the decisions we are making for the long-term health of our company, some of which did bring us more toward the mid-point of our original guidance range. From an operations perspective, the commercial business is performing better than antic-pated with the cost of serving load coming in lower than expected, plus some optimization opportunities around our fleet and load given the market volatility. Our generation business continues to be an industry leader when we look at utilization rates expected to be over 94% for the year with cost still well below the industry, but we did have some in operating outages of both nuclear and power, that had higher replacement costs than we had experienced in a long time. And as I said, we've also made some strategic decisions around our business this year that have impacted current year earnings, but are the right decisions for our business going forward. First, we've been talking with all of you this year about the organic growth opportunities ahead of us, including our work on hydrogen. As we see our finish to pursue these growth outlets, many of us further benefit from the IRA as Joe discussed. We have made the strategic decision to take on more growth related O&M to advance these efforts. Second, as I talked about last quarter, we continue to find signed fixed price multi-year contracts for our customers in the face of an extremely backwardated curve. We have longstanding relationships with our customers in signing multi-year deals, provide them with a budget certainty and visibility that they need to run their businesses. These contracts are weighing on our second half results and will likely carry into the first half of next year, but have compelling economics for us over the full life of the contracts. Being a good partner to our customers is important to us, our commercial business, and positioning for a number of our future growth opportunities. Third, as we said before, we are not immune to the pressures of a tight labor market and wage inflation. Coming out of the separation, and reversal of plant retirements last fall, our vacancy rates were elevated and we've made significant progress in restaffing. We have reduced our vacancy rate from approximately 9% in February to 5% today. We [also ensured] [ph] that we have the best talent to run our plants, sell to our customers, and support our businesses. Accordingly, we took a look at our compensation packages and realized that we're out of staff in some areas and have made adjustments to ensure we provide competitive pay. Finally, as you all know and many of you have benefited from our stock prices performed very well this year. As part of separation, we wanted to have an ownership culture in reinstated equity as part of our long-term compensation for our key managers through executives. And while we would like to replicate this stock performance every year, this year is well above what was anticipated in our financial planning and is driving additional costs, particularly in 2022. We are happy with our results this year and remain focused on driving long-term value for the company and our owners. Finally, turning to the financing and liquidity update on Slide 14. Our balance sheet remains extremely strong and our risk profile has undeniably improved as a result of the IRA. As Joe mentioned, earlier this month, S&P upgraded our credit rating from BBB minus to BBB, while maintaining positive outlook, a significant credit positive story for us. Along with the ratings action, S&P revised its business risk to strong from satisfactory, reflecting their view of a material improvement following the passage of the IRA. We want to thank our colleagues at S&P for their thoughtful review of our business. The upgraded S&P is also a further evidence and acknowledgment of the stability of our cash flows and competitive advantages we have going forward. We are now two notches above investment grade of both S&P and annuities. We are maintaining our credit metrics that are well above our downgrades thresholds and remain committed to a strong balance sheet. Although we are also encouraged by S&P\u2019s openness to us taking advantage of our strong balance sheet to fund M&A opportunities as they come up over time. Beyond the validation of our metrics, business model, and outlook, the ratings and parity between the agencies have some immediate benefits, including more favorable collateral requirements and credit terms with counterparties that have lowered our posting by several hundred million dollars since the quarter ended, as well as lower rates on long-term debt in commercial paper. Our liquidity position remains strong with more than $2 billion in unused capacity as of September 30. As I close out, I'd like to remind everyone of the financial strength that sets us apart from others in the market. Our strength allows us to pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities to grow the business, while returning value to our shareholders. It also provides us with more opportunities to transact in volatile markets where margins expand as risk is more appropriately reflected in pricing, and we're better positioned to service our customers, all while meeting any additional [collateral hosts] [ph] without the need for additional liquidity in those associated costs. I'd now like to turn the call back to Joe for his closing remarks. Joe Dominguez : Thanks, Dan. The company is strong. It's built for the long haul and it's an essential company for America. As valuable as the IRA was to the company and to the nation, the thing I'm really proud on about is extending the life and beginning really to extend the life of what we did with Clinton and the announcement on Dresden. These are just the most important assets for America at this point in time. Financially, we're executing well and our balance sheet is in great shape. Our investment grade credit rating is extremely valuable. So, I'll close with the value proposition. We're a unique company that can't be replicated and our assets as I said are critical to meeting our climate goals. The IRA has de-risked the business providing four excellent inflation protection and an exciting platform for growth. We own nearly 25% of the U.S. nuclear fleet producing the most carbon free energy in the country, nearly twice as much at carbon-free energy as the next generator. These plants can run for 80 years, a useful life that's longer than any other carbon-free generation that exists today and in the case of renewables that will be built over the next decade. We provide power to nearly 23% of all competitive C&I customers in the U.S., including three-fourths of the Fortune 100. This puts us in the best position to meet the growing demand for customer driven carbon-free energy and sustainability products. We're the best operator of nuclear power plants in the country [indiscernible] and that delivers enormous value. We generate strong free cash flow through our best-in-class operations, our retail and wholesale platforms, and our support for clean energy and our focus on costs. And finally, we intend to deliver value to you, our shareholders through our capital allocation strategy. We told you that we provide you with an update this year and we're working on that, but as many of you know, there are some meaningful potential inorganic growth opportunities that align with our strategy and we need to see how these things play out before we could provide an update. But as a reminder, our capital allocation strategy starts with maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings, which provide us a competitive advantage. We provide an $180 million annual dividend growing at 10%. We believe there are opportunities to grow our business organically and inorganically and we will see growth opportunities that exceed a double-digit unlevered return threshold and will deliver long-term value to our customers. And when we don't have those opportunities or don't have those opportunities in a particular time frame, we will return capital to our owners through a special dividend or share buybacks. With that said, I'll open it up for questions and I apologize for the noise on our end, there was a little glitch with the mic. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Shar Pourreza : Hey, good morning, guys. Joe Dominguez : Good morning, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Joe, maybe we can start with an update just on the market for the nuclear assets now that IRA has, kind of been digested, a couple of processes going on. What have you been seeing in the market? And is M&A just more or less likely at this point based on recent dialogues you've had? And then do you have a firmer date in mind on when we could see a capital allocation update if inorganic opportunities don't meet your threshold at least in the near term? Joe Dominguez : Yes, sure. Let me answer that last part first. I think these inorganic opportunities will play themselves out by the time we speak again on our fourth quarter call. So, my view is, we'll know whether this stuff is going to be actionable for us by that point in time. But we are looking at some stuff right now. I think the fact that the IRA got resolved gives us some sense, gives everybody some sort of uniform sense around the floor price for these assets. And that's very good. It doesn't resolve every valuation question, and each asset is very different. I spoke frequently about the importance of the size of the particular near asset and why we like dual units a lot better than we'd like single site units? So, those variables are going to exist as we look at any particular asset going forward in [the period] [ph]. I think I could speak that obviously there was a talent process to look at the sale. Its asset, that was a very complicated situation because it wasn't just a nuclear cell, but it involved some fossil cells. So, any involvement we would have in that would require us to marry up with another buyer that would take the fossil assets. And Talent announced recently that they didn't have any conforming bids that would buy all of the assets. As other things come on the market, we'll take a look at them. We\u2019ve talked to all of you about that and we're going to take a look at everyone. We're going to be very disciplined. We think the business will consolidate, but we don't have a timeframe that we're necessarily looking at, right. It's owners' willingness to transact that's going to drive it. So, I don't know, Shar, it's going to \u2013 this all of the floodgates, certainly starts to settle a little bit of the valuation, but in the short-term, looking to the extent that we're looking at things. I think those will resolve by the time we're having the fourth quarter call, and then we will be able to return to a discussion of what capital return to shareholders should look like. Shar Pourreza : Okay, perfect. That's what I wanted to level set. So, if something inorganic doesn't transpire, it takes some time, you're not married to having to disclose capital allocation before year-end, so we can maybe expect it around the February call when you report year-end results? Joe Dominguez : Yes. I think, look, I think on the last quarter earnings call, I indicated that we would like to provide that information to our owners by the end of this year. And we are aiming for that, but things happen that we don't control and opportunities develop and we're going to explore those. Shar Pourreza : Okay, perfect. And then lastly, I don't know, this shouldn't be a surprise, but I mean obviously you guys like everyone else are seeing labor and material inflation. We're getting a lot of questions on it this morning. Have you seen \u2013 Joe, have you seen any moderation more recently at a higher level? How should we, sort of think, should we be thinking about maybe the potential pressures in 2023 and beyond as it relates to your initial guide you guys rolled out with the Analyst Day earlier there's year, which was just shy of $4.5 billion per year? Joe Dominguez : Yes. Look, Shar I don't think we're seeing anything unusual in this business. What is unusual about our business is the protection that were afforded through the IRA. So, we wanted to spend some time at the top of this call because I don't think folks necessarily focus on the price escalator that's built into the IRA in the event we're in an inflationary environment. But let me give it to Dan to maybe \u2013 Dan maybe you could unpack some\u2026 Dan Eggers : Yes. Thanks, Joe. Thanks, Shar. It's a good question. And I think Joe kind of hit off on the point that we are having the inflationary production of the IRA. If you think about this year, right, the inflationary environment has really been good to us from power prices moving higher into levels we haven't seen in a real long time, which is clearly helping the business. When I look at the cost of human indulgence for a second, I'll kind of break down our costs a little bit more for you from an overall O&M budget perspective. First off, a little bit under half of our O&M spend is associated with labor, right. So, we\u2019ve got half labor, half supplier, and contract work. Of that O&M bill for labor, about 25% to 30% is going to be for our workforce, it\u2019s going to be the represented population. Our longest labor contract [since go until 2027] [ph]. So, we have pretty good visibility on labor inflation rates on that piece of our labor bill, kind of in the 2.5% range. On the non-union side, I think that we saw some of that this year with the hiring and recalibrating some of our pay levels. We are seeing upward wage inflation just as you're seeing everywhere else in the economy, kind of top to bottom. So, that's something keeping an eye on. Our focus is making sure we pay our people fairly and well. And so, we're managing that, but that\u2019s something I think this is kind of the reality of the world in which we operate right now. If I go to the contracting and supplier side of the equation, and really this is predominantly nuclear and power related spend when we get to this side of our dollars. About half of that spend is kind of with 20 major partners, so large partners to the company of big providers. We generally sign multi-year contracts with them, with inflation caps or bands around them. That's helped to manage some of that inflation in the Q3 percent range. Obviously, there's some sensitivities as we go through renewals and there are some causes for things like commodity escalation and things like that. It hasn't been a huge drag so far, but something we're keeping an eye on, and on the other half of the supplier, right, these are going to be a wider range of suppliers, smaller, shorter contracts and things like that. So far, we've managed that inflation pretty well and certainly well below what we've seen in the market, but it's something we'll keep an eye on. Given our size and how we buy, we get benefits of both buying. We also buy in inventory, so we spaced out some of those costs they roll through, particularly when we think about nuclear inventories or things like that, which will help us to manage our costs. A couple of things that I called out in my script today, [that you think about] [ph] for kind of next year, the growth spending that we had this year, I think you should expect us to continue to make some investments in growth. This is an important opportunity for us and putting money to work there to help fuel that opportunity is important. On the stock comp, which was fairly notable amount of money this year, the tails on that are pretty small to be honest. Most of that gets timed this year just on how the true-ups work. So, there's a little bit there, but in the scheme of what our O&M spend is, it's [pretty tiny] [ph]. So, that's probably how I would think about O&M as you kind of look at your model and our plan will be to refresh all these numbers for all of you on the fourth quarter earnings call in our normal course. Shar Pourreza : Perfect. Thank you guys. Very helpful disclosures. Thanks. Bye. Joe Dominguez : Thanks, Shar. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steve Fleishman : Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thanks. So, just on the \u2013 Joe, one of the growth avenues you mentioned is [uprates of nuclear] [ph], could you talk to what the uprate potential might be in the fleet and any timing on that? Joe Dominguez : Yes, Steve, first of all, good morning. So, as we dug into the IRA, a little \u2013 one of the things that we're saying is that the way we interpret the [indiscernible] I think everyone interprets the bill is that for incremental [carbon-free megawatts] [ph]. This isn't perfectly accurate, but you basically get a double PTC for those incremental megawatts. So, Bryan Hanson and our Chief Nuclear Officer, Dave Rhoades have kicked-off a process to look at different upgrades that might be available to us as of \u2013 we've looked at these for a number of years, so we're not starting from scratch. We'll be looking at the economics of those upgrades over the fourth quarter. I think we're being in a position where we'll start to be able to provide an update on the fourth quarter call. I think it's fair to say it could be hundreds of megawatts, but we need to look at the economics to see if they make sense. What's good about them, right, is that when you increase the output of the machine, you're not adding people. So, there are upgrades without incremental O&M associated with running the machines. And in some cases, it involves adopting technologies that actually allow us to become even more efficient from an O&M perspective. So, we need to get costs from vendors and we need to study the implementation cost, but that's something I think that's going to be available to us now. And we'll be able to talk on the fourth quarter call. I don't think I'd give you more color than that right now. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And the double PTC would essentially be, kind of one for being like a new carbon-free megawatt and then another for being nuclear PGC, essentially? Joe Dominguez : Yes. Let me \u2013 I'll turn it over to Kathleen Barron who's here with me, who could explain how it works. Kathleen Barron : Hi, Steve. Yes, Joe\u2019s talking about the tech neutral credit that is for any carbon-free resource that goes into service at the end of 2024. So, you would no longer be eligible for those incremental megawatts for the existing reserve PTC. You would transition into that new carbon-free tech-neutral credit that's roughly double the value. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Joe Dominguez : [Indiscernible] what is pipeline credits, right? Kathleen Barron : That's right. Steve Fleishman : Yes. Okay. Thank you. And then just going back to the prior question on O&M, I know you don't want to really define all that at the moment, but just with respect to the [part] [ph] that's related to growth initiatives, can you give us a sense of, kind of how much you're willing to size that? And then to the degree that you start moving forward, projects, would it get capitalized into those? So, it's kind of temporary. Just how to think about how big the [Multiple Speakers]? Joe Dominguez : Yes, Steve. You know, I don't want to put it too fine a point on us. We're still trying to understand of these opportunities [indiscernible]. I don't want to give you an exact number, but it's going to be less than 1% right now of our O&M is going that kind of spend just by context, okay. So, that's probably how I think about it. I don't think I'm seeing it getting any number above that, if that's helpful. As we look forward and as we go from, kind of this work to moving forward on projects, you're right, we will start to capitalize them once we have a sizable project with a plan and a business commitment to move forward. I think we'll probably have some level of O&M spend is not going to capitalize on growth for maybe several years to come or longer because there's always going to be work on trying to develop the next project even as one gets underway, right? So, one hydrogen project could go and it'd be the work on the next one or the other behind [indiscernible] cycle, have some sustaining growth O&M there, but as we move to commercialize any project that would be capitalized. Dan Eggers : And Steve, it's kind of everything. It's the hydrogen stuff, we started from a position earlier in the year where frankly we just needed to learn a lot before we get into this track. The hub work, the work is investigating upgrades and other growth opportunities. All that stuff as a starting company essentially that hasn't done a lot of those investments over the last few years, required us to bring in some talent, some consultants and other experts to get smarter about that. And that's at a cost this year. It's smart. It's good investments. It's what we need to be doing. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Paul Zimbardo with Bank of America. Your line is open. Paul Zimbardo : Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Just to kind of fold together this stream of questions. Could you give expectations on all-in how much you expect O&M to change year-over-year into 2023? Joe Dominguez : Paul, as I said, I think we'll give that update on the fourth quarter earnings call when we kind of give a comprehensive view of all the pieces put together, including the roll forward on our gross margin outlook. So, it's probably a little bit early. I think it's kind of fair when you think about some of the things enumerated on a prior question, with Shar that we are seeing some pressures where we do our best to mitigate that as we can. But I guess, fair to understand that there are some challenges out there in this inflationary environment. Paul Zimbardo : Okay. Understood. And then secondly, could you just elaborate a little bit on how the change in interest rate influences the plan for capital allocation and more specifically the right level of leverage prospectively. Just kind of how you think about that, whether it's on a, floor from a PTC level of EBITDA or the higher market levels as well? Joe Dominguez : Yes, I think we're comfortable with the balance sheet [is right now] [ph]. I think the flexibility that affords us is attractive, right? And we saw the support of the agencies, which we're happy about. We also kind of look at the balance sheet as a tool we can use and we look at some of these potential larger investment opportunities. The idea of using the balance sheet to support them is going to be available to us. So, we're good with where the leverage is right now and the ability to flex it when opportunities come up. When I think about the return on capital as we make new growth investments or a threshold we look at for M&A or anything else, we talked about a double-digit unlevered return at the Analyst Day. That is still our North Star as we\u2019re evaluating opportunities and projects internally and I don't see that changing at this point in time. So, that's pretty well where we are. Paul Zimbardo : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Joe Dominguez : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Joe Dominguez : Good morning, David. David Arcaro : Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. Good morning. On hydrogen, I was wondering, what's the current state of commercial discussions with partners or suppliers? Wondering if any of the different, kind of business opportunities the by wire or co-locating [a fuel cells] [ph] might be farther ahead than others at this stage? Joe Dominguez : Look, we're in kind of NDA space with a lot of folks here. So, I would say that there have been very extensive conversations on all fronts. in both the colocation, as well as providing energy to customers who want to reduce hydrogen at their own site. And what we're hopeful is that by the first quarter, we'll be in a position where we're going to be able to start to announce some commercial deals and commercial activity. The hub proposal is going to take a little bit longer, Kathleen, if you want to share a little bit of your thoughts on the timeline for that work, but that also has some commercial contracts that will be a significant part of that work. So, in a sense that stuff has to be done before the DOE could that the [funding] [ph]. Kathleen Barron : That's exactly right, Joe. It is a deployment hub. So, the announcement that went out last week about the MachH2 coalition in Illinois and the breadth of that demonstrates how many commercial parties are involved to create a bid to the DOE that demonstrates all the different potential production cases and use cases and the midstream, sort of connection between the two. So, as part of that announcement, we have a number of different hydrogen producers, transportation companies, greenfield producers, national labs, NGOs, and a number of governors and senators expressing support for the alliance as announced, the next step will be to get the bid together for the DOE, which is due in April. And then later in 2023, we'll find out where DOE is going to direct that $8 billion of government matching dollars to get the [indiscernible] into development and ultimately into production later in this decade. But as Joe said, we have had some really great conversations across the hydrogen value chain, just to pull together that just for that alliance to be pulled together, which is making folks at least in the Midwest super excited about potential there for building out the clean hydrogen economy. David Arcaro : Okay, great. Thanks so much for the color there. I was just wondering in the quarter on the unplanned outages that you saw, wondering if there were any common, kind of underlying causes there or any need that you might fee for additional kind of spending related to the issues like maintenance CapEx or anything that might be lingering beyond last quarter? Joe Dominguez : Yes, nothing unusual and nothing that we think is going to affect future operations or projects. We had some one-off issues in probably the longest outage. We had a vendor provided part that didn't perform up the expectations. And missed the specifications for that part, that created an issue for us. The reality is, these sorts of things happen every year, but every year, we're not talking even in the Exelon days about outages. But at these very high prices, you lose 10 days or a little bit more at Nine Mile, which is one of the outages that we \u2013 that occurred during the quarter and it becomes a significant drag. It adds up quite quickly. So, let me flip it over to Bryan Hanson to see if there's anything else he wants to share here? Bryan Hanson : No, I think you covered it, Joe. There's nothing extraordinary about any of the issues we had. We'll provide some more vendor oversight to make sure the quality of parts that we get meet our standards. And again, we have very high expectations of how we operate these plants. And so, when a piece of equipment isn't performing right, we'll take the plant down made to repairs and to restart it. And I'm just still pleased that wrapping up our refuel outage season here in the next couple of weeks with the four outstanding refuel outages this fall and we're on track. And like Dan said, better than a 94% capacity factor for year-end, which will be industry leading as always. David Arcaro : Okay, understood. Thanks so much. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our last question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, good morning team. Thanks for giving me time here. Just \u2013 hey, Dan, just wanted to check-in on the Analyst Day, you have this free cash flow, unidentified free cash flow guidance of 1.8 billion to 2.2 billion. The gross margin is tracking higher since then, but then you have some O&M as you articulated towards some growth projects. So, how should we think about \u2013 where are we tracking in that range if you could just update us there? Dan Eggers : Yes, we're not refreshing that specifically here, I would say, on the year as the EBITDA is [indiscernible] our CapEx is tracked online and I think our performance this year is certainly consistent with our expectations that we have underline that page in the Analyst Day. As I think about next year and we're always going to go through a budgeting process, but the price outlook and the market conditions have improved for next year. Obviously, we can't have a cost discussion what's going on today, but I think we feel good about the numbers we shared with you in the spring. Durgesh Chopra : Awesome. Thanks. And then just maybe a finer point. On the Q4 call, what should we be expecting? Should we be expecting \u2013 2023 guidance looks like, but could we expect a longer dated EBITDA guidance? Some of the investors have talked about perhaps providing a floor. So, in addition to the capital allocation update, how should we think about, sort of pro forma EBITDA guidance ranges? Dan Eggers : Yes. I think we'll give you the 2023 guidance for sure. We'll give you some gross margin disclosures and head disclosures certainly through 2024. There's a little bit of complexity, as you're well aware, without clarification from treasury on how gross receipts are going to be calculated. That does have a varying [bolt on] [ph] EBITDA and free cash flow and how they're going to look. So, I think we want to get through that process and have a little more clarity there before we probably extend beyond the 2023, 2024 look. That could also complicate a little bit how we talk about it, a base EBITDA number, but it's something we\u2019re trying to getting our arms around because we know that you guys would like to see it, but we also want to make sure we have a well-reasoned number that's supported by, but we're going to get our treasury. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. Thanks so much guys. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Joe Dominguez for closing remarks. Joe Dominguez : Well, thanks everybody for joining us today. And like I said at the outset, to many of our new [owners] [ph] for their interest and involvement in the company. It was a terrific quarter. We knew, look, we knew walking into those call folks, we're looking for us to probably increase guidance. And we've talked a little bit about the inflationary pressure with [indiscernible], but that's a piece of it, but there's growth costs that we had this year as we investigate opportunities. There are stock compensation issues because our employees are enjoying the upside that many of you have enjoyed already, and we've had a fairly significant shaping situation with our contracts, contracts that we like very, very much and happy to have been able to do that business. And then we had a few extra days of unplanned outages. But other than that, the business has been performing just to all of our expectations and we're very excited about the future. So, look forward to entertaining you again on the fourth quarter call and until then be safe. Take care of yourselves and we'll end the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Emily Duncan, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin. Emily Duncan : Thank you, Justin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the Constellation Energy Corporation's fourth quarter earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Joe Dominguez, Constellation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Eggers, Constellation's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Constellation's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.  We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of Constellation's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates regarding Constellation and its subsidiaries that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Constellation's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other circumstances and considerations that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations.  Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. I'll now turn the call over to the CEO of Constellation, Joe Dominguez. Joseph Dominguez : Thanks, Emily. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. We've been a stand-alone company for a year now, and what a year it's been. We really appreciate the confidence our owners have shown in the company and its future.  I'm going to start on Page 5 of the deck with language that ought look pretty familiar to you. A year ago, we laid out our strategy for the company and made commitments to you focused on creating value, namely that we create an enduring business with the unique ability to tackle the climate crisis, that we'd operate a premier and transformational ESG companies that sets a high bar and leads the way for others and we'd protect our balance sheet and deliver exceptional value to our shareholders. Thanks to the hard working women and men that run our power plants and serve our customers, along with the corporate teams that support them, we're well on the way to delivering on these commitments.  This year, we produced 180 terawatt hours of carbon-free clean electricity from nuclear, wind, solar and hydro, which we estimate to be about 11% of all carbon-free energy produced in the U.S. in 2022. On the customer front, retail customers ranked Constellation as the #1 retail energy supplier. We continue to offer strong pricing and innovative solutions like CORe and carbon-free energy matching, what we call 24/7, that are meeting customers where they are today and anticipating where they're going to be a few years down the road.  Following a bumpy 2021 marked by challenges in Texas during super storm Uri, our power business, which includes all of our hydro, renewables and natural gas plants has bounced back and arguably has had its finest year ever. The investments we made in the Texas fleet worked. Our clean nuclear energy centers continue a string of excellent years. Once again, our nuclear performance led the industry. And to put this in context and give you perspective, our capacity factors have been the best in the industry for over a decade. Now that track record ought to give you great confidence in our ability to sustain performance. But there's a much bigger meaning to having the largest, most reliable and most resilient clean energy fleet in America. It means when the chips are down and the grid is facing a crisis moment, like PJM faced during winter storm Elliott, just the latest example of these harsh storms, Constellation's plans are the difference between keeping the lights on or having a Christmas without heat and light for millions. That's dramatic but it's also correct, and it's just that simple. And storm after storm demonstrates the same thing.  I know this morning, you likely read the news in our release about the financial benefits we'll receive in PJM capacity bonus payments, payments that we earned during Elliott. And we'll talk about the PJM a little bit more this morning. But it's part of a much bigger story in energy and it's part of the value thesis for this company. In 2022 at long last, clean nuclear energy finally got appropriate credit for the environmental value, the E, if you will, in ESG. That drove the IRA and it drives interest in our stock. But candidly, however, our view is that clean nuclear energy continues to remain undervalued from both a policy and ESG perspective. Because it's not just the E part of the ESG story that makes our assets important. It's the S, too. And what I'm talking about here is the enormous societal benefit of having affordable clean energy, together with high levels of reliability and resilience. It's what makes our assets among the most important of any class of energy assets in America, and it's what you will own here at Constellation.  In this regard, I to your reading Constellation Sustainability Report, which explains how clean energy pieces fit together and how Constellation's customer-facing business is helping C&I customers to develop and expand their sustainability plans by providing greenhouse gas emissions reports and clean energy products. As you know, providing highly reliable clean energy to power the grid is just the beginning of the future we see for the company. The IRA unlocked many opportunities. It gives us unique opportunities grow by upgrading our existing plans and earning an enhanced PTC with those incremental megawatts to grow by investing in hydrogen and to grow by extending the lives of our assets to 80 years and increase the number of megawatts to our fleet producers. These are the opportunities and investments you will see today -- in today's presentation.  Finally, we talked at Analyst Day about giving back to society. In 2022, we walked the walk. One of the best ways to give back is to create family-sustaining job opportunities for people and communities that need them. That's why I'm happy to report that this year, we hired 2,000 new people across all of our businesses that will earn good wages and benefits and bring that value back to their communities. Earlier this month, we announced a historic pledge with the North American Building Trades Union to increased diversity in the graft jobs that are in the backbone of our company and the backbone of this nation. They're essential to the clean energy future. Our spending with diverse businesses increased by $200 million. Our people showed their heart and their passion and their generosity by volunteering 80,000 hours to their communities, and they gave along with the company $12.5 million in charitable contributions.  Now all of this was done as we executed the financial commitments that we're here to talk about this morning. We achieved 2022 EBITDA of $2.667 billion, taking the top of our guidance range. We paid down $2.5 billion of debt and generated robust free cash flow to support our strong balance sheet, a strength that was recognized by the S&P and their upgrade and in their continuing positive outlook for our business. We distributed $185 million in dividends to shareholders and we delivered total value return of 75% versus negative 14% for the rest of the S&P 500. It was a good year. And as promised, we're meeting our commitment to you to provide an update on capital allocation.  So let's flip to Slide 6, and I'll walk you through it. At Analyst Day, we laid out our capital allocation philosophy. We've maintained a strong investment-grade credit rating. You saw we enhanced that this year. We provide annual dividends growing at 10%. We grow the business organically and inorganically where returns exceed a double-digit unlevered threshold. And where we don't have those opportunities or they don't meet the thresholds, we're going to return value to you, our owners. Now over the course of the year, we have significant developments. The IRA was enacted, it opened the door to the growth opportunities that we discussed in nuclear and hydrogen and will provide a floor of support for our business. And the whole geopolitical and energy world got turned upside down due to the war in Ukraine with long-term effects.  Given these developments, we made a number of decisions to support long-term value creation. We have secured nuclear fuel through 2028, which will allow us to withstand any future Russian supply disruption. We're investing in our nuclear fleet so that it could provide clean energy on the grid for at least 80 years. And we've begun implementing a plan to upgrade plants to achieve more output with no incremental O&M. Our balance sheet and credit metrics remain strong and continue to be the backbone of our financial policies and they provide an enormous competitive advantage to us. We will double the share of dividend starting with the March 23 payment and we'll then target 10% growth beyond. We will continue to invest in our assets, which will supply the grid with clean energy from our nuclear fleet for decades and help decarbonize America.  I said a moment ago that we have the best assets and best operations. Our mostly dual unit fleet cannot be matched by any other asset class in America. We will remain disciplined in our evaluation of M&A opportunities, which includes making decisions informed by our own assets and how they compare it to others. We've explained how we look at value and our strong bias to purchasing well-maintained and well-supported multi-unit sites. At this moment in time, we haven't found an actionable opportunity, but we continue to believe in the consolidation of the industry and we will continue to be patient and disciplined as we explore every one of those opportunities. With that lens, we and the Board believe it is more valuable in the organic opportunities we have at hand as well -- that there is more value, excuse me, and the organic opportunities we have at hand as well as in our company's own shares. Accordingly, we're going to invest $1.5 billion in organic growth that meets our double-digit unlevered return threshold, including uprates at Byron and Braidwood, the first we've authorized; investments in 300 megawatts of wind repowering and refurbishment; and we've allotted $900 million in capital to begin to satisfy the growing demand for clean hydrogen in our regions. Now Dan in his remarks is going to go into detail on those investment opportunities.  In addition, our Board authorized $1 billion in share repurchases, a direct investment reflecting our belief in the strength and value of our company. And even with these investments and the enhanced shareholder return vehicles we've announced today, we still will have approximately $2 billion in additional capital to be allocated in '23 and '24. This will allow us to pursue additional organic growth opportunities that meet our return thresholds, provide strategic flexibility for M&A. And to the extent that these opportunities do not materialize or if they don't materialize in this time frame, we'll look at opportunities to return the value to you.  Now turning to Slide 7. I already touched on this. I mentioned at the top of our call that our power generation business had an excellent year, tying our best ever dispatch match, meaning our ability to respond and operate the plants when grid operators order us to do so. Our nuclear fleet continues to lead the industry. 94.8% capacity factor makes it the seventh year in a row with a capacity factor over 94%, the best in the industry, as I said, for over a decade. Our 11 refueling outages averaged an industry-leading 21 days, matching our fleet record.  Turning to the customer business on Slide 8. Our team had an exceptional year and was able to create significant value managing the portfolio through a very volatile year. We had strong and effective portfolio management success and load options. All whole, we served 208 terawatt hours of wholesale and retail load, and we continue to see strong customer renewables and new customer wins in both our power and natural gas business. And we had our best year ever in the CORe product. As you know, during these calls, I often update you on deals we've executed. But to put that in perspective, we've executed 6 deals for 12 customers, delivering 1.65 terawatt hours of renewable energy annually and creating strong margins for Constellation.  Turning to Slide 9. The clean energy center strategy for the company is the key to accelerating the transition to a carbon-free future for America. In 2022, we made strides towards our corporate purpose of accelerating this future. We announced our intent to seek license renewals at Clinton and Dresden, with Dresden being our next step in bringing the entire fleet to 80-year lives. We're making hydrogen today at Nine Mile and using it as a test bed for the future growth opportunities that I mentioned before, and we're working with others to secure hydrogen hub DOE funding in many regions. And finally, we're exploring through a DOE grant the ability to use our cooling towers to take carbon out of the air, a technology that could result in clean energy centers having negative carbon emissions. 2022 was a great year to show the potential of these clean energy centers. 2023 is the year that we will begin to put those plans in action.  Now turning to Slide 10. As I mentioned before, PJM went through a great emergency in December. And it was the latest evidence that time and time again, always-on nuclear is there when other resources fail. It was true back in the '14 polar vortex when 22% of PJM capacity failed, with 81% of it being either coal or natural gas and nearly 1/4 of the wind not showing up either. Nuclear saved the day with 96% of the nuclear units operating and preventing a catastrophe. Reforms were made, as you recall, and PJM customers have paid about $58 billion in capacity payments since the rules were changed, all in an effort to avert the crisis that occurred during the polar vortex.  But disappointingly, we saw almost the same facts leading to PJM great emergencies during the winter holidays, once again, nearly a 1/4 of PJM capacity failed with 90% of it being fossil. Folks, we know that renewable is intermittent and it's difficult to plan a future around. But the other truth of it is that fossil assets are not performing during these severe storms. That forced PJM to issue emergency conservation orders, which were followed by alerts from governors and utilities across PJM. 38% of the natural gas plants did not operate when needed. In contrast, Constellation's nuclear plants ran at a perfect 100%. Let there be no doubt that clean nuclear energy saved Christmas this year. But the point I want to leave you with is this. We're going to learn as a nation and a world that dispatchable clean generation is the most valuable thing in energy. We kind of know it already. That's why we're investing so much in things like battery and hydrogen and other forms of energy storage, all things that aim to pair renewables and provide more predictable and resilient clean energy. But you see, we already do that. Clean, reliable and resilient energy is what our fleet does every single day and better than anyone else in the world. And that's what you own when you own constellation.  Now I'm going to turn it over to Dan for the financial outlook. Daniel Eggers : Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot of cover today from a finance perspective. We're excited to share our capital allocation plan, which we are confident will create value for our business, our customers and our owners. I'm going to build on Joe's comments by providing more details around our growth projects and cash flows. I will also give an update to our financial outlook as we roll forward our disclosures.  But I'll start with our 2022 financial performance. We had a very strong first year financially, earning $2.66 billion in adjusted EBITDA, which exceeded our narrow guidance range of $2.45 billion to $2.65 billion. Our commercial organization had an exceptional year in managing the portfolio, creating opportunities around our fleet and load in a volatile market. Our nuclear fleet performed extremely well during winter storm Elliott, as Joe discussed earlier, and we anticipate being one of the primary recipients of bonus payments. The strong performance from the business was able to offset untimely generation outages, margin shaving and cost pressures we discussed in the third quarter call. The entire leadership team is very proud of how Constellation performed in its first year, both financially and operationally, and I'd like to echo Joe's appreciation to the entire organization for a job well done.  We're also introducing 2023 EBITDA guidance of $2.9 billion to $3.3 billion with a midpoint of $3.1 billion, which is up over $500 million from last year's midpoint. I'm going to use the following slide to talk to the key inputs to EBITDA and then free cash flow. Turning to Slide 12. I wanted to talk about the nuclear PTC included in the IRA, which we believe is truly transformational for our company. It provides downside commodity risk protection backed by the U.S. government with unlimited upside to higher commodity prices. It supports unique growth opportunities in clean hydrogen and uprates, it extends the time horizon of our fleet to 80 years and include structural inflation risk protection. Mechanically, the nuclear PTC is designed to provide downside support in the declining price environment, phasing up and down when a plants' market revenues of between $25 and $43.75 per megawatt hour with maximum support of $15 a megawatt hour.  This chart shows the illustrative payoff dynamics in 2024. The blue shaded box shows the revenue levels or the PTC support would be available up to the maximum $15 credit when revenues are at $25 and basing down $0.80 on the dollar until you reach $43.75 per megawatt hour, the point in which the PTC value would be 0. With this design, our effective revenues for nuclear plant will be between $40 and $43.75 over a range of revenue starting at $25. Equally important, we retain all of the upside when revenues are over $43.75.  So bringing this conversation to life, the green line represents an electricity price above the $43.75 threshold where we would not receive a PTC payment but would collect that price for our power sales, which is consistent with history. The orange line represents a $35 price where we are in the PTC zone and would, in turn, capture $7 PTC because we are below the threshold, bringing the realized revenues to $42 a megawatt hour. Inherent to the drop in power prices in this case, the PTC provides significant downside protection to our business and is a materially positive change from history when facing a lower price environment.  We have positioned our portfolio in 2024 to reflect this new dynamic from the downside protection that PTC provides. There are still many unknowns about exactly how the PTC will work that needed to resolve in Treasury's implementation of the legislation. We expect to have this guidance before the end of this year, which gives us time to adjust our strategy once we have clarity.  Now let me discuss how we are incorporating the PTC into our disclosures. Slide 13 provides our gross margin update based on prices at year-end. In 2023, total gross margin is projected to be $8.35 billion, up $100 million from last quarter, lifted by higher power new business targets as we are seeing additional opportunities on the back of the strong performance in 2022. We are introducing our 2024 gross margin forecast of $8.95 billion, up $600 million from 2023. This is largely due to the timing of our hedges and higher prices. With this update, we have added a road to the bottom of our gross margin table for 2024 when the PTC program goes into effect. As you know, we're still waiting on final ruling of interpretation from Treasury around the nuclear PTC, but we want to provide some insight into the financial impact.  So let me explain what this line is and what it is not. This line represents the PTC value we would expect to generate from our plants that do not have state support, so the Pennsylvania and Maryland units as well as LaSalle and Illinois, and using the more conservative spot price methodology that calculates the PTC value without consideration of hedges. In this representation, we will use the forward 2024 prices at each update to determine whether PTCs would be generated. Since we are still in conversations with the states around existing programs, we have not included those units in this analysis.  With price at December 31 above the $43.75 PTC floor that I discussed just a moment ago, we do not currently forecast PTC contributions in 2024, which is why there is no PTC revenues in this line on the table. We will plan to use this approach for addressing the PTCs with each quarterly update as we work to reach clarity on final implementation and Treasury and outstanding issues with the state programs. After we have resolution on these issues, we will look to have a more substantive overhaul of our disclosures to best reflect the value and importance of the PTC to our business.  Turning to Slide 14. We provide an updated view of our CapEx outlook through 2025. As Joe mentioned, we are making investments to derisk our business and set us up to create long-term value. Our CapEx plans have increased from the '22 Analyst Day with investments in the mid $2 billion for the next 3 years. The majority of the increase can be attributed to the $1.5 billion of organic growth projects, increased nuclear fuel spend and an increase in baseline CapEx, largely around timing. I will use the next 2 slides to talk through where we are seeing increases and why.  Moving to Slide 15. I'm excited to provide further details on the $1.5 billion of growth investments we are pursuing with each opportunity exceeding our double-digit unlevered return threshold. The IRA was transformational in many ways, including by allowing us to accelerate some projects where the economics are extremely compelling. We continue to believe that hydrogen produced nuclear plants will play a critical role in addressing climate change by helping to decarbonize hard-to-decarbonize sectors. We have spent considerable time over the last year exploring how we could play a role in the hydrogen economy and create value for our business and our owners.  Nine Mile Point is the first -- was the first in the country to produce hydrogen from nuclear power. We are active participants in the hub in the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic hub and the Northeast hub, with ease exploring commercial applications for hydrogen alongside nuclear-powered stations. We plan to deploy approximately $900 million of capital towards building a first-of-its-kind commercial scale, greenfield hydrogen production facility in the Midwest. This facility will initially have a capacity of 250 megawatts, the equivalent of producing approximately 33,450 TPA of hydrogen and will be built for ready expansion to 400 megawatts. Approximately 90% of the hydrogen produced is expected to be sold through offtake agreements with customers who will be co-located at our facility. And as Joe has said, we expect to announce commercial deals in the coming months.  We are in the early stage design -- early design stages of this project. Procurement of the appropriate equipment, construction and commissioning will take some time. We expect the facility to be in commercial operation in 2026. The support for nuclear in the IRA has also made extending the lives of nuclear assets to 80 years more likely assuming continued support. It has also caused us to relook at nuclear upgrade opportunities that had been shelved a decade ago. The tax credit starting at $27.50 per megawatt hour for the production of new carbon-free electricity provides opportunities for us to expand the capacity at our plants. As a result, we have decided to pull forward planned turbine replacements in Byron and Braidwood and take advantage of the upgrade opportunity in the IRA by committing approximately $800 million from 2023 to 2029, demonstrating our firm commitment to preserving and enhancing our world-class fleet. Approximately $600 million of the spend was already embedded in our long-term plan towards the end of the decade.  You can now see this step up in baseline CapEx on the prior slide beginning in 2023. With our work to replace the aged turbines, we will invest an additional $200 million to fund even more efficient models and install higher efficiency, high-pressure turbines to gain additional capacity. These projects utilize the latest turbine technologies to address aging issues, increase operational reliability and reduce future turbine inspection frequency and duration. In total, we will increase the asset of Byron and Braidwood by 135 megawatts. Turbines are long lead parts and will be installed during scheduled outages between 2026 and 2029 with increase in capacity coming from each round of work. We're continuing to evaluate other nuclear uprate opportunities and we'll provide updates on additional investments as we validate the scope of work and appropriate economics.  Finally, on growth, let me turn to our opportunities for wind repowering and refurbishing that Bryan talked about at the Analyst Day, we've identified $350 million of investments for approximately 315 megawatts. These projects have low risk of execution, will qualify for new PTCs and will make the existing sites more efficient to generate greater output at the same wind conditions. The first 70-megawatt parcel repowering is expected to be in commercial operation this year. We're excited about these growth prospects, supporting our commitment to be a leader in advancing clean energy goals and earning appropriate returns on our investment. We see these investments they first step and will continue to explore additional opportunities that meet our double-digit unlevered return thresholds while remaining disciplined in our decisions.  Turning to nuclear on Slide 16. In response to the Russian-Ukraine conflict, our nuclear fuels team has worked diligently over the past year using their deep relationships and buying power to secure enough nuclear fuel inventory and future contracts to meet our needs through 2028 even as existing contracted Russian fuel supply was disrupted. This inventory build will bridge our new fuel supply from now through 2028, at which point, multiple Western providers have stated they are able to have additional supply online. The incremental fuel buying is driving much of the CapEx increase with the remainder primarily due to sharply higher prices for uranium enrichments and conversion services as a result of the conflicts. We believe this is a prudent allocation of capital to ensure operating reliability given supply uncertainty.  From a P&L perspective, since fuel in our operating expenses over time, we're forecasting year-over-year inflation and fuel costs but at levels still below $6 per megawatt hour when we get after the 2028 time period. We continue to work with the administration, Congress and other stakeholders to facilitate the expansion of domestic enrichment and conversion facilities within the United States to improve the security of nuclear fuel and its contribution to meeting our nation's carbon goals.  Turning to O&M on Slide 17. Our costs have moved up but are generally flat across the disclosure period, setting the new baseline for costs for our current operations. These updates require some context to help better understand what we are seeing. When I look at the increase, there are several major buckets driving the changes from last year. First, starting with growth-related expenses. We talked previously about the need to ramp our spending on growth to support all the strategies we've been talking about over the past year and that are starting to bear fruit with the announced CapEx. This number will vary by year, but will remain less than 1% of our total O&M budget.  Two, we have an increase in cost but also have revenue offsets captured in our top line forecast. The conversion of growth investments into contributing projects will have associated O&M costs, including the big capital projects we just talked about like hydrogen, but also spending on initiatives of commercial that are capital-light, for example, our core growth strategy but have profitable revenue contributions. We're also anticipating higher future bad debt expense with higher prices and what are more predictable default rates, but we've been adjusting our pricing to reflect this higher cost. As our growth investments come online, you should reasonably expect O&M increases that are more than captured with higher revenues. Three, as we discussed on the last call, although we had some labor and supply inflation productions, we are not immune from inflationary pressures or the impacts of restaffing our workforce during these highly competitive times. As Joe said, the deep work at Constellation the key to our success and ensuring that we not only attract the best talent but retain them is paramount. To do this, we must be competitive with our paid benefits.  Fourth, the CMC saved the plants retirement for 5 years and the IRA now gives us greater confidence that these plants and the entire fleet will continue to operate for 80 years with continued policy support. Prior to the IRA passage, we're always looking over our shoulders about how long some of our units would run beyond existing state support mechanisms, and we're understandably making decisions on the level of investment in cost based on life expectancy. We have reversed those decisions, and as a result, they are contributing to some O&M increase from Analyst Day. When we look at the long-term value of these assets, we believe the additional spending is appropriate.  And finally, we've learned a lot over the course of the year as our first year as a stand-alone company. We have found that some of our support cost assumptions were not sufficient to support our base business, let alone one poised to take advantage of our future opportunities.  Turning to Slide 18, we show our projected credit metrics for 2023, which remains firmly in the mid- to high BBB equivalent range. At S&P, we are rated BBB and remain on positive outlook following our recent upgrade and remain Baa2 at Moody's with a stable outlook. The investment grade balance sheet continues to bring value and provide competitive advantages in today's markets, positioning us well as we head into 2023. Our balance sheet, along with our debt maturity profile with a weighted average maturity of 13 years, provides us flexibility as we continue to look to grow our best-in-class fleet both organically and inorganically. It provides us with more opportunities to transact in volatile commodity markets where margins expand as risk is more appropriately reflected in pricing, and we are better positioned to service our customers, all while meeting our liquidity needs.  Turning to Slide 19. Let's talk about our capital allocation plans for the next 2 years covering 2023 and 2024. Starting on the left, we forecast approximately $4 billion in free cash flow before growth after absorbing the increase in base CapEx and nuclear fuel that I covered earlier. Moving to the right, we continue to manage our balance sheet to our 35% CFO to debt target, which with the increase in earnings and cash flow, affords us about $800 million of debt capacity after higher net collateral requirements. Collectively, we have approximately $5 billion of cash available for allocation. Approximately $200 million will go towards the remaining capital and O&M spend related to the separation and for the ERP system implementation with the rest then going to our value creation and return commitments we've been discussing today. Nearly $800 million will be returned to our owners with the doubling of the common dividend this year, growing 10% next year and beyond. $1 billion of the $1.5 billion of growth CapEx will be deployed over these 2 years, again, with returns exceeding our double-digit unlevered threshold. We then plan to return another $1 billion to owners through buybacks. That leaves us with approximately $2 billion of unallocated capital over the next 2 years. This unallocated capital provides us with flexibility to pursue our strategic priorities, including nuclear M&A and additional organic growth as long as those projects meet our return thresholds. And as you're seeing today, if those opportunities don't materialize, we'll return the capital to our owners.  Thank you all for your time today. We look forward to another strong year in delivering on our financial commitments, and I'll now turn the call back to Joe. Joseph Dominguez : Okay. Thanks, Dan. Well, folks, as you can see, we had a pretty spectacular first year as a company. And now it's time to have another one. In '23, we're going to continue to focus on operational excellence, delivering on our financial commitments and working towards our purpose of accelerating the transition to a carbon-free future. We're focused on ensuring the success of the hydrogen work we're doing, delivering additional megawatts and extending lives of critical clean energy center assets. We'll work with Treasury and other states on IRA implementation issues, and we will continue to effectively deploy capital to the benefit of our shareholders. We will continue to update you throughout the year on these matters during our calls.  Now, Justin, I think it's time for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from James Thalacker from BMO Capital Markets. James Thalacker : Maybe just questions for Dan. I guess I was hoping to get a little more color on the higher growth-related CapEx that you've outlined in the updated slides. And specifically, you discussed generically that these organic growth projects will exceed your double-digit thresholds. So I want to confirm that this is a double-digit unlevered IRR threshold first and foremost. But then I was also hoping that maybe you could discuss a little bit if we look at these 3 different channels whether it be hydrogen, nuclear uprates or repowering, could -- are there different return profiles for each one of these or just disproportionate return? And is this driven by a function of the leverage that you think you can put on these discrete projects? Or is it driven more by the overall economic margins you see prior to the leverage? Joseph Dominguez : James, I'll start off. It's an unlevered return threshold. We've been hopefully clear on that in these calls. It's hard to kind of say the different we'll always have different value. But we see a lot of value in the upgrades. Dan could kind of walk through why that is. But it's combination of the capacity factor and the fact that we could do these upgrades and not have the O&M that any other kind of asset would have. And I think on hydrogen, we're still learning. I think -- what I can tell you is we're comfortably within the parameters that we've set for investments. And I think as we start rolling through some of these investments, you'll have a better sense of how repeatable they are and what the numbers actually are. And I know we will announce those projects as we get to execution, and you'll get a chance to see that. Dan, do you want to talk a little bit about the uprate work? Daniel Eggers : Yes. I mean it's kind of interesting when you think about the uprates at 135 megawatts. It's a lot of megawatts when you put it in clean energy equivalent value, right? It's almost the same as 400 megawatts of wind. We're going to get that equivalent energy output $200 million with the same $27.50 per megawatt hour PTC tax credit, right? So think about the gearing on how many megawatts you get to that amount of capital is quite attractive. As Joe said, all of that back-end work, right? There's no additional O&M. There's no additional fuel to make those work. So there's -- the economics on those look awfully good, and we're continuing to run down a list of projects to see what else we can advance forward. It will take some time to get those on, as I said, just based on the timing of getting equipment manufactured and then managing the refilling our business. But that's -- and it's great for the environment. It's great for the company. So we're real excited about those. I think the other question you asked was about kind of leverage and how that's affecting the return. So as said, these are all unlevered investments at this point in time. Our assumption is we're managing our balance sheet to that 35% CFO to debt. That's been kind of the for us for the last year and will continue to be. So the future opportunities to think about finding differently. We'll look at that. But I think we have the time to further in service to make those decisions. James Thalacker : Okay. Great. And I guess just one other real quick question. I guess in sort of pre-spinout, one of the things you talked about in terms of capital return is obviously the dividends and the organic growth. But there was also a discussion in terms of common stock buybacks versus special dividend. Can you give us a little bit of a view, I guess, on how you're thinking about that trade-off between doing common stock buybacks versus actually -- when you would actually look at a special dividend as a preferred route to get money back to shareholders? Daniel Eggers : Yes, it's a good question, Jim. And I think about where we are, it's been quite a year, and we've learned an awful lot about the business as far as where our investment opportunities are. The IRA dramatically began to change the landscape for opportunities to deploy capital. I think you got hydrogen the operators, there's a lot of things that have really opened up, and we made a lot of progress this year, $1.5 billion of growth capital from an organization that wasn't putting that kind of capital to work. Our expectation is 2022, we're going to learn a lot more about the opportunities for investment. We're going to see how inorganic opportunities play their way through. But I think we're going to continue to learn more about the size, scope and duration of our investments. And that will then inform some of our capital allocation decisions for the long term, right? We think that the dividend increase today made a lot of sense. It's still 20% or less of our free cash flow for growth. We think that's a very reasonable payout at this time. And it will continue to evolve. But I think the balance right now is the growth investment, the dividend is the right setup. Joseph Dominguez : Yes. The only thing I'd add to that, James, is that obviously, we're looking at the relative value of our stock right now compared to other assets in the market. At the end of the day, the Board is making a determination of how we feel about our own company, our value and the value of the investment in stock. That will move around certainly over the course of the years, and it may cause us to make different decisions halfway. But the relative value and the are things that drove us to a buyback. Operator : And our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : So just a couple of things. The increase in CapEx related to fuel, could you just talk to how much of that is kind of this inventory build versus actual higher fuel cost? And then also just how long does this inventory build last? Does that higher level of CapEx start rolling down after the period you're showing? Or could you get some sense on that? Daniel Eggers : Yes, Steve, I'm not going to give you the exact numbers. But what I said in the prepared remarks is the majority of that increase is associated with inventory over this period in time. Remember that what we're doing right now is we're continuing to expect that the Russian deliveries are contracted to provide, will continue to occur. We will be buying fuel from other providers who will make sure that we would cover any potential Russian store calls. We'll be net building inventory out towards 2028, assuming Russian delivery -- if the Russians were to -- if fuel is no longer available to us the capital numbers would change. We are admittedly seeing higher prices both on the pieces of fuel we had not previously purchased. And then we've talked to you in the past about there some hedge in our numbers. When you saw uranium move, really conversion and enrichment services go up 50% to 100% over the course of the year due to the conflict, that is putting upward pressure on that fuel bill. So it is more than inventory reserve. Joseph Dominguez : And Steve, to your question, how long. I can't get a sense it's how long is this price is going to continue to unfold. But right now, I think this is where we're going to be at for a number of years. We just -- the philosophy here is pretty plain and simple. We're never going to be in a position where we don't have fuel for our machines. We're going to take that risk issue off the table for ourselves and for our owners. And so that's driving our plans right now. And I think and given what I'm saying with the Russian situation, what we're all saying it's going to be like this for a while, maybe permanent. Steven Fleishman : Okay. Secondly, on the hydrogen project. When we think about how you're going to capture returns there, obviously you'll have an investment and some kind of, as you said, contracts for the hydrogen. But how should we think about the interaction between the nuclear plant and what it sells its power at to the hydrogen projects? Like is -- will some of the return come from that side, too? Or how should we think about that? Daniel Eggers : Yes. I think that when you look at the returns, right, the power sales have got to stand on their own, right? We look at the returns or economics of the hydrogen facility, the input production of hydrogen in sale, that's what we're talking about, the double-digit leverage returns. So the investment there, the production and sale of the hydrogen is going to make economic sense on its own. The generation will be sold at a price that makes sense for us also. So we're not co-mingling our returns adjusted by a hydrogen bill. Joseph Dominguez : Yes. Steve, it's a really cool kind of investment because in a certain sense, if energy prices were to decline, there's incremental value on the hydrogen side because of what's happening. Let's just kind of pretend some numbers here. Let's suppose prices go from $40 to $35. From a company standpoint, we're going to get the tax credit that will true us back up at $43.75 for the energy sale. Plus production of hydrogen just became cheaper. So it's -- we've talked about it quite a bit here. It's one of these interesting things that's been the Holy Grail in this business. How do you find many businesses that are negatively co-variant to natural gas? So that actually, when natural gas prices go down, it's a better story for Constellation and the top line story is immediately what's happened to power prices. The floor support in the PTC does that to a significant degree, as Dan mentioned. But the other piece of it that's interesting is this interaction between power prices, making hydrogen even more economically viable at lower prices. So it's the ability to get both of these production tax credits that makes it a very good strategic way for us. Steven Fleishman : Great. And last question just on -- obviously, last fall, you were very focused on M&A at the time and now not as much. And maybe you could give us some perspective on just what are you seeing in the nuclear M&A market that from the processes you've kind of been looking at it such? And how does that kind of impact your thoughts on that for the future? Joseph Dominguez : We're always bound by confidentiality when we look at any group of assets or any companies so I'm not going to get into the specifics. What I would say is the same impact that has happened to our fleet and the value of our company is expressed in those acquisition values for M&A. But that's where we get to kind of have to take a little bit more of a disciplined view of looking at the quality of the assets that are available, how well they have been maintained and this big criteria for us around dual unit sites as opposed to single unit sites. For our fleet, we're invested in 23 units. 21 of them operate as a dual unit site or effectively as a dual unit site. The only 2 plants that are outliers are Clinton, right, and . And in both those circumstances, the reason they're part of our fleet is because the states have had clean energy policies that require the existence and continued operation of these plants. So that's the way we've looked at it. We've run every single one of these assets out there. We know exactly what to look for in diligence and we've been disciplined. I'm not trying to signal to you that we think any less of the consolidation opportunity. That's not my intent here. But I think when people heard us talk about discipline, they had a view that, that was something that we sold on and we're not. We already have a tremendous business here, unparalleled by any other group of assets, and I'm not going to dilute it by overpaying for anything. If there are assets that come to us that are available at what we believe is a reasonable price and they meet the criteria we talked about, we're going to go after it. But it takes 2 hands to clap in this space. And I think the other reality is we probably aren't seeing the same passion for separating these assets from traditionally regulated utilities that exist in pre-IRA and frankly throughout the separation of Exelon into its 2 component parts. So that's what we're seeing. I think there will still be opportunities, and we'll kick the tire on everything. So I don't want to indicate a lack of opportunity, but it's the reality of our discipline and the reality, as I said, of the fact that these units are more valuable in the IRA setting, and strategically, companies are holding on to them. Operator : And our next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro : I'm just wondering just you've got $2 billion of additional capital that hasn't yet been allocated. Wondering just what the milestones or timing you would envision in terms of identifying other investment opportunities to start to allocate that capital. Could more opportunities kind of pop up through 2023? Or is that potentially a chunk that could roll over into 2024 and serve as an ongoing base for a potential allocation? Daniel Eggers : David, it's a good question. I'd say that -- as I said, we've learned a lot in 2022 about opportunities going forward. We have a lot of things in queue that we're looking at right now. Joe reiterated the fact that we're still very interested in inorganic opportunities when they make the right sense for us and maintaining that flexibility. And I think there's $2 billion certainly afforded that to us to look at opportunities they progress this year and into next year makes a lot of sense. I don't think we have a shot clock saying we're going to have a decision by X date to release some amount of this money if we don't have a an investment or whatever, but we'll be prudent as we saw this year as far as making high-return investments and then returning the excess. And that's how you should look at us moving forward. David Arcaro : Okay. Got it. And then I was just wondering, just digging a little bit more into the hydrogen opportunities, I was curious which end markets you're envisioning in terms of who might be the off-takers for the hydrogen. Wanted to clarify, they're taking the volume directly from the site so you don't have to deal with transportation. And I was also just curious if there's an electrolyzer producer or technology identified at this point. Joseph Dominguez : Yes, David. On the latter, we have that -- the developer and who's going to make the electrolyzers. We have a pretty good sense of that. And we haven't announced it first day and we went into a competitive process. So I'm going to hold on that. In terms of the offtake, you're exactly right. We're looking for opportunities where the customer counterparty is at the site, taking the hydrogen at the site without the need to compress or otherwise transform through pipelines or whatnot the hydrogen to other facilities. I guess the cautionary point on all of that is that we're part of this hub and that hub is still evolving. And so I do anticipate there are possibilities that hubs will include pipeline hydrogen to customers that are off our premises, and we'll see how that kind of plays out. And I hate to not share it all, but I don't want to front-run the announcements we'll be making on this, and we've still got some commercial terms that we've got to work through and get these deals executed. David Arcaro : Okay. Got it. And no indication at this point as to just the end market in terms of if it's industrial uses or fertilizer or jet fuel or other areas like that? Joseph Dominguez : Not proportionately, but the answer is yes. I think at the end of the day, it's going to be all of the above will be markets for hydrogen that are at best produced at our site. But let me kind of leave it there. Operator : And our next question comes from Paul Zimbardo from Bank of America. Paul Zimbardo : I was hoping, could you elaborate a little bit on that comment on the slide about working with the state policymakers to reduce the nuclear support, I assume, the ZECs? What states are you working with? And what would the timing, whether that's legislative or regulatory, to get conclusion? Joseph Dominguez : Paul, I've long ago learned that the worst way to kind of have these discussions with policymakers is to talk a heck of a lot about them on earnings calls because we're having these conversations where you would expect us to have them. Let me flip it over to Kathleen with the caution that these are confidential discussions and we'll see how they unfold. Kathleen Barron : Yes, sure, Joe. I mean I think you know the locations where we're talking about. We have state programs in 3 places and we have 4 programs across those states. So that's where we are. And of course, the goal is to make sure that these states that acted first to keep the plants online get some benefit coming out of the national support for the nuclear fleet. So what we need to work through is just precisely how those provisions are going to work, both federal and state, and importantly, the timing to make sure that everything lines up properly. So as we said, we've started to have the conversations and we will let them play out according to how the states would like them to and not sort of discuss that anymore at this point. Paul Zimbardo : Okay. Duly noted. And then I know you commented a little bit on the special dividend commentary and relative value. But just at a high level, what's the philosophy around the authorized share repurchases? Is it something more programmatic or opportunistic? Daniel Eggers : Yes. And I think as Joe said, we see real value in our software. It is here today. We have the $1 billion authorization. I think we will find ways to be in the market and I probably want to get into the strategy more than that isn't like particularly prudent to get too much of a layout. But we like where the stock is here, for sure. Operator : Thank you. And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Joe Dominguez for closing remarks. . Joseph Dominguez : Well, thanks, everybody, again, for joining the call for your interest in our company. It's been a great ride this first year. But as I noted earlier, our attention now is focused on '23 and beyond. We're off to a strong start. And I just want to thank again the folks at Constellation who made this happen every single day at the plants, in the commercial business and the back office functions. The stats ought to demonstrate this, but we feel we have the best team in the business, and we're just really excited by what the future may hold for us. So thanks again to everybody, and we'll talk again after the next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Constellation Energy Corporation First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a Q&A answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder this call may be recorded. I would like to now introduce your host for today's call, Emily Duncan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Emily you may begin. Emily Duncan : Thank you, Leah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Constellation Energy Corporation's first quarter earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Joe Dominguez, Constellation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Eggers Constellation's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Constellation's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Constellation's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates regarding Constellation and its subsidiaries that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Constellation's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other circumstances and considerations that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. I'll now turn it over to the CEO of Constellation, Joe Dominguez. Joe Dominguez : Thanks, Leah, again who started this morning. And thank you Emily for that. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. I'm going to start on slide 5 of the deck. Once again, we're off to a strong year operationally and financially, thanks to the focus and dedication of the women and men that do their best every day to produce and deliver clean reliable and affordable electricity to our customers. For the first quarter, we earned $658 million in adjusted EBITDA. But the top line story here is that based upon our performance to date, we can project that we will end the year comfortably in the top half of our guidance range. And if we continue to execute, we expect to be at/or near the top of that range. In addition, 2024 looks better to us than when we reported in February. Our commercial team had a tremendous quarter, not only generating better than planned earnings in the quarter, but they were able to lock in value for the remainder of this year and for next. On the back of their strong execution, our gross margin is up $50 million in 2023 and $100 million in 2024. As Dan will cover, all-in 2023 is up $100 million from where we were in February. For 2024, we expect to come in notably above current consensus, which you could see using our disclosures on page 25 of the presentation. And in our gross margin update, you'll also see how the PTC interacts with our portfolio to add value in the face of lower commodity prices. We think that the message here is pretty simple, our company had a strong first year and is on track to have great years two and three. Our business is unique and we still have many opportunities in front of us to create value for our owners. We are the best operator of nuclear plants and the largest producer of carbon-free clean energy in the United States. We produced approximately 11% of our nation's clean energy last year. Our commercial business serves 25% of the entire competitive C&I market in the United States, 75% of the Fortune 100. Our businesses are essential to addressing climate change and will be needed for decades to come to provide clean and reliable energy as America simultaneously reduces its reliance on fossil fuels, and the transportation industrial agriculture and residential sectors, all increasingly turn to electrification to reduce harmful pollution. The Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA provides unique opportunities for Constellation and its owners. Through the Nuclear Production Tax Credit, the US government has made a long-term commitment to our nation's nuclear assets recognizing that without them we simply cannot meet the climate goals. The PTC provides downside commodity risk protection as you could see in our disclosures today, while ensuring that our plants remain economic and reliable. The PTC protection level rises with inflation, providing us structural inflation risk protection. Other provisions of the IRA create unique growth opportunities like increasing the output from our nuclear plants through uprates and hydrogen. And finally it gives us the opportunity to extend the time horizon of our fleet to 80 years. And we've made this point I'll make it again, no other clean energy asset except hydro can run for this long without being replaced. We have many ways to grow and bring more value to our shareholders. Against the baseline earnings level, support provided by the PTC over the life of the PTC, we will benefit from forward price inflation that grows with overall inflation in the country. And as you can see on slide 18 depending on your assumptions about inflation there are some meaningful top-line growth opportunity ahead for us in the PTC. We generate strong free cash flow that can be used to fund robust organic growth at double-digit unlevered returns, disciplined M&A and fund a growing dividend and the buyback of our stock. Each of these will create additional value for our shareholders. And we're already doing this. We have announced $1.5 billion of growth in uprates, hydrogen and wind repowering double the per share dividend. And in March alone we bought back approximately $250 million of our own stock as part of our authorized $1 billion buyback which we will execute. And there's more we can do. We have $2 billion of unallocated capital in 2023 and 2024 that can be used to further enhance our earnings growth. At our current stock price, I'd be happy to use this capital to continue buying back our stock all day long. We will continue to look for investment opportunities consistent with or adjacent to our core businesses, and we are committed to the energy transition. However in the absence of any near-term M&A opportunities or a ramp-up in growth CapEx, we will in the short-term use the majority of the $2 billion to repurchase our own shares. Constellation cannot be matched anywhere in this marketplace. Our clean carbon-free nuclear fleet paired with our customer-facing business provides us with opportunities to grow and create value for you. It is a unicorn. I'll turn next to our quarterly operational updates beginning on slide 6. Nuclear performance was strong and slightly ahead of plan. We produced more than 40 terawatt hours of reliable affordable and carbon-free generation from our nuclear plants with an on-plan capacity factor of 92.8%. As some of you may be aware during routine inspections during our Nine Mile Point 1's refueling outage, we identified an issue with non-safety-related well. It's not uncommon in the industry, but it did extend Nine Mile's outage to 39 days. The cost of the repair is absorbed within our existing budget. But the point I want to make here is that even with the extended outage at Nine Mile, we returned to service roughly in line with the industry average for a standard refueling outage of approximately 39 days. And the point here is that at Constellation a long outage is just average for everyone else. And while Nine Mile lagged our ability to lead the nation in returning units from outages was demonstrated at both Byron and Calvert Cliffs, which completed their refueling outages ahead of plan and at an average duration of 21 days in total. Our renewables and natural gas fleet also performed well with 96.6% renewable energy capture and 98.4% power dispatch match. The team is presently completing our summer readiness work to make sure that it's ready for the hot summer months to come. Turning to slide 7. I'll talk a little bit about the Commercial business, but I already mentioned before they've had an incredible start to the business. It's a business that benefits from the opportunities that volatility in the commodity markets creates. We're able to leverage our expertise to give our customers certainty of their energy costs in this volatile market environment, while realizing higher unit margins across both wholesale and retail as risk is more appropriately reflected in pricing. Our balance sheet strength is a key advantage to supporting our customers and being able to capture these healthy margins. Providers with more constrained balance sheets and less experience with volatile markets are not able to provide customers the certainty and the visibility that our customers desperately want and need. Our balance sheet strength allows us to provide this needed certainty to our customers. We operate our generation and customer businesses symbiotically with each other supporting and making the whole stronger. As such, we can optimize our positions across the combined generation and workload portfolios to create additional gross margin, particularly, in times of volatility. And again, I'll just hit this I think the results this quarter and what we've predicted for the remainder of the year and next demonstrate all of this. And we have continued success developing and providing sustainability products like core to our customers. As I mentioned earlier, this strong performance creates additional value for you both in 2023 and 2024. And before I turn it over to Dan for a full update on the financial outlook I want to address our O&M disclosures from the last call. We're confident in the firmness of our forecast and the entire management team is coming committed to ensuring that this forecast is met and it will be met. We will always look for additional opportunities to run our business as efficiently as possible. Dan? Dan Eggers : Thank you, Joe and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 8, we earned $658 million in adjusted EBITDA, which is above our plan for the first quarter. The favorability to our expectations came with the strong results of Commercial plus the updates the PJM winter bonus payment as we have gotten more clarity from PJM. Compared to the first quarter of 2022, our results were lower than the $866 million in adjusted EBITDA. Our quarterly shaping in 2023 will differ from last year in part due to our hedge prices that are higher than last year, the comparability will be impacted by the start of the CMC program in June of 2022; timing of opportunities in the commercial business; the greater number of planned refueling outages in the first half of this year compared to last year; and the shaping of O&M. In 2022, we saw ramping labor costs over the course of the year as we staffed the organization. The difference in staffing levels and costs will be widest in the first quarter and then normalize as we move through this year. As Joe said, we remain committed to our 2023 O&M targets. For the full year, as Joe commented earlier, we expect to be comfortably in the top half of our guidance range of $2.9 billion to $3.3 billion. Turning to Slide 9 and our gross margin outlook, we are now forecasting to be at $100 million in both 2023 and 2024. Overall, forward power prices in 2023 and 2024 have seen downward pressure since year-end, following the record warm winter that has created an oversupply situation in natural gas markets. Our existing hedges and the nuclear PTC support in 2024 effectively mitigate much of this pressure. When we look to 2025 and beyond where we are comparably less hedged, we see prices at or above year-end levels, reflecting natural gas prices that are normalizing in the low $4 per Mcf range and tightening supply-demand dynamics with announced plant retirements that are further supporting power prices. The upside to gross margins is then coming from the strength in our Commercial business, where we are seeing better margins as risk is being more effectively priced given market volatility and higher liquidity requirements. For 2023, our gross margin forecasts are up $100 million to $8.45 billion, due to our existing hedges, strong performance by our Commercial team and the increased payment from PJM associated with Winter Storm Elliott. These drivers more than offset the weather-driven downturn in prices since year-end. As a reminder, the power new business/to go line moves into the mark-to-market of hedges line, when a transaction is executed with this road naturally declining, as we move through time and deliver on our plan. So in the first quarter, we executed $250 million of new business and then increased our target by another $50 million translating into the $200 million reduction in the new business/to go line. In 2024, our total gross margin including PTCs is up $100 million from our last update to $9.05 billion when we take into account upward revisions to our Commercial business outlook of $100 million, our hedge positions and the PTC downside protection of $100 million. With the drop in forward power prices, the PTC is functioning as it should stepping in to provide downside protection as some of our non-state-supported units fell below the PTC threshold. Taking into account the increase in gross margin and the cost lines we show on Slide 25 in the appendix, you can see that our outlook for 2024 is also higher than the consensus. Turning to the financing and liquidity update on Slide 10, we are delivering on our promise to return value to our shareholders. Our first quarter dividend has doubled from the level we paid in 2022 and we started our $1 billion share repurchase program that was authorized by the Board in mid-February. We view our stock as very attractive at these share price levels and we aggressively initiated our share buyback completing nearly 25% of the authorized program by repurchasing 3.2 million shares for approximately $250 million in March. We will continue to be opportunistic for the remainder of the authorized program. And we still have an additional $2 billion of unallocated capital in 2023 and 2024, that could be used to create additional shareholder value through growth investments, M&A or additional return of capital to our owners. In the first quarter, we also accomplished most of our financing plans for the year with good demand and at attractive rates. We remain on track to hit our credit metric targets and we continue to have constructive conversations with the ratings agencies. Both our S&P and Moody's ratings and metrics remain firmly in the mid- to high BBB equivalent range. I'll now turn the call back to Joe for his closing remarks. Joe Dominguez : Thanks, Dan. And I'm going to go to Slide 11 and conclude our prepared remarks. And I'll just end where I started on the value that Constellation brings to you our shareholders. We think it's a value that can't be found anywhere else. We own nearly 25% of the US nuclear fleet, producing the most carbon-free energy in the country, nearly twice as much as our next competitor. These plants can run for 80 years. That's a useful life, that's longer than any other carbon-free generation that exists today. In the case of renewables, it will operate longer than any renewables that are built in this decade. We're the best operator of nuclear plants period. And we provide, power to nearly quarter of all competitive C&I customers in the U.S. including three-fourth of the Fortune 100. All of this puts us in the best position, to meet the growing demand for clean energy and reliable sustainable products. Our balance sheet strength is an advantage over others in the market. We have unique opportunities to create additional value for our shareholders, the increasing value of the PTC overtime through the inflation adjustment that's embedded in the law and our strong free cash flow allows us to fund a growing dividend robust organic growth. And where we could find compelling M&A, we'll do it. But if we can't find those opportunities then we're happy to return capital to you, through share buybacks. I'll now open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro : HI. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Dan Eggers : Good morning, David. David Arcaro : Good morning. Maybe starting out with the Commercial results they were very strong. You had some good success in new business creation. I'm wondering if you could just elaborate on what you're seeing or where you're seeing the strength. And maybe more broadly, the competitive environment in retail, what are you seeing for churn and any changes in market share there. Joe Dominguez : Yeah. I think the financial retail and wholesale markets and in-turn margin is really a reflection of the underlying physical power generation stack and the demand fundamentals. And when we see that physical stack get tight, when it's under weather-related stress or demand is increasing then we see higher volatility and markedly higher retail and wholesale prices. Of course, we all know this relationship between the physical stack and the financial markets and the weather events in Elliott, Uri and many other unnamed storms demonstrate that effect all throughout year. But the physical stack is undergoing a rapid change from coal-fired resources that are less reliable, because they don't have on-site fuel or introduce intermittency risk in the case of renewables. And so that physical stack is changing today. And today I think when you participate in either the retail markets or the wholesale markets you have to ask yourself, really three basic questions. Do I have physical generation? Is it the kind of physical generation that's going to show up in extreme events? And do I have the financial balance sheet to deal with negative outcomes? Many folks, who haven't asked those questions historically, have been hurt. Some driven out of business entirely, but this is where I think our fleet really shines. This is where our business model really shines. Because we have the physical assets that operate in extreme weather events, they're clean energy assets that are going to live for a long time and our Commercial business is both smart and benefited by the fact that we have a strong balance sheet. So in effect we have physical generation that runs. We have a Commercial business that has a competitive advantage of others. And so when others see risk of volatility, they add those costs into the price that they're willing to offer in wholesale and retail markets, because we don't have those risks, that translates into incremental margins in our businesses. And so that's what we're seeing. I think that's really been the story of the first quarter. And really it's been an evolving story. I think it's going to continue for some time. At some point people don't price in risk, and they'll get hurt again. But right now they're pricing in the risk. And for us that's margin expansion, because we have the right fleet and the right business model. David Arcaro : Got it. That's helpful. I appreciate that perspective. And wondering if you could also give an update on, the inflationary pressures that you're seeing just in terms of labor contracts and material costs. Was 1Q consistent with your expectations heading into the year? How do you see it trending for the year? I heard your confidence in being able to achieve it wondering, if you're seeing any difference in the pressures on the business this year so far. Joe Dominguez : No. I think we predicted it well in our plan. And we're right on plan. David Arcaro : Okay. Got it. Straight forward enough. I'll leave it there. Thanks so much. Joe Dominguez : Operator, we're ready for the next set of questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe. Your line is open. Joe Dominguez : Good morning, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Yes. Good morning. Thanks. Yes, just on the commercial upside you're seeing. I know -- I'm just -- the 2024 gross margin is a lot better than we would have expected just on power prices. Does some of this benefit the way you contract go into 2025 even, just given the way you contract, or is it more kind of 2023, 2024? Joe Dominguez : Yes. Steve, we're obviously not putting numbers out there for 2025. But, yes, this trend doesn't end in 2024. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Great. And then, big picture question. Just any concerns you have about IRA related to just this debt ceiling issue with the Republicans having IRA removing the bill? And just any thoughts on likelihood that that is a real risk. Joe Dominguez : Steve, at this point we just see that as kind of -- it's hard to use the word normal, but the political back and forth that's occurring. But I don't think there's any prospect that President Biden is going to cut or gut the IRA to deal with this issue. And at the end of the day we're confident it will get solved. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Thank you. And then, lastly just on uprates. The -- I know you kind of came out with some growth investment for uprates that were I think more ones that were a little more normal course, but I think you're still working on kind of the potential for others over time. Just any update on how you're thinking about uprate opportunities? Joe Dominguez : Nothing that we're ready to announce today, Steve. But to your point, we are working through some other opportunities and we think there will be. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Great. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you. Joe Dominguez : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. Joe Dominguez : Good morning, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Good morning, guys. Good morning, Dan. Good morning, Joe. Quick ones here. I know, Joe, you guys mentioned on the fourth quarter call that you were working with kind of state policymakers to potentially reduce their support in light of sort of the federal PTC. Any updates on those efforts, especially as you look at states like New York? Joe Dominguez : No, Shar, the only thing I'd say on that, we've -- those conversations have continued to evolve, nothing unexpected. There's nothing that is different about the way they're looking at it than the way we're looking at it based on the conversations we've had. We just haven't -- those agreements haven't been memorialized and in some cases might not get memorialized until after the guidance is actually issued, because it's -- obviously, we still have a whole year really to go before we get to it. But I think those conversations are progressing very well. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. And then, on the gross margin side, obviously, you talked about it a little bit. You're now looking at about $100 million in PTC credits for the non-state-supported plants. Could we get a little bit more detail on where that is coming from? And it looks like from the sensitivities, it might be weighted towards LaSalle. But any additional color you can provide here as we see this creep up in gross margin for the first time? Thanks. Dan Eggers : Yes. Shar, this is Dan. I think if you look into the sensitivity -- good morning -- the sensitivity table on page 23, you can see the moves up or down would affect both NiHub and the PJM West fleets which would suggest that we're having plans in both markets where at the bus [ph] they're going to be able to be below the PTC threshold. We've already picked up there. Remember that our PTC sensitivity is only for the plants who do not have state support. So to narrow that down, right, it's going to be LaSalle in the Midwest and then Limerick Peach and Calvert in the East. So it is affecting on both sides. And you can see the sensitivity to prices there which also is a useful tool for you guys to desensitize your models. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. And then, just last thing, sort of, to ask -- and I'm getting questions on it this morning. But I guess would you have guided to the top half without the additional PJM invoice uplift? Thanks. Joe Dominguez : Yes. Shar Pourreza : Fantastic. All right, guys. Appreciate it. Congrats. See you soon. Joe Dominguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Paul Zimbardo of Bank of America. Your line is open. Joe Dominguez : Hey, good morning, Paul. Paul Zimbardo : Hi. Good morning. Thank you, team. Nice update across the board. Well done. Joe Dominguez : Thank you. Paul Zimbardo : Following up on the capital allocation discussion, you referenced growth and potential consolidation as influencing the timing. Just are there things discrete that you're watching for? And just, in general, when should we expect you to start to move some of that unallocated to the allocated bucket? Joe Dominguez : Let me flip that to Dan. Dan Eggers : Hey, Paul. Good morning. I think that, Joe talked about the uprate. I was asked earlier, we're looking at a number of growth opportunities that take a little time to manifest so we're going to continue to work through those. We continue to look at the market for potential M&A opportunities. I think nuclear generally, comes to the top of that list and we're going to be pretty focused there. We have the $750 million of buyback, to work our way through. I think we have a little time to get through there. And we'll continue to analyze, both the scope of opportunity and then -- when we can put that out. So, I'm not going to give you an exact timeline, but we're certainly keeping a close eye on how quickly, we can deploy opportunities that come through there. Paul Zimbardo : Okay. Great. And then I heard the opening commentary on your view on 2023 and 2024. Is it still a fair expectation 2024, formal EBITDA guidance would come on the fourth quarter call, or could that come sooner? Thank you. Joe Dominguez : Yes. No, it will -- the formal guidance come on the fourth quarter call. But Paul, what we've been trying to do with these new disclosures is to kind of give you all of the moving pieces, which will update quarter-to-quarter. So you'll see the formal guidance, but you can start to piece together the story obviously. Paul Zimbardo : Yes, for sure. Thank you all Joe Dominguez : Thanks, Paul Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question is from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Durgesh Chopra : Hi, good morning, team. Thanks for giving the time. Just Joe, a finer point on capital allocation. You talked about the attractiveness of the share price. I just want to be clear in terms of the unallocated $2 billion for 2023 and 2024, could that potentially go towards an upside share buyback? Joe Dominguez : Good. Sure. But it would mean that the other opportunity sets that we've talked about whether that be organic or inorganic growth opportunities, did materialize in the time frame. We have -- and we understand it's kind of a short time period to execute in 2023 and 2024 on those opportunities. And if they don't occur, as I said in the prepared remarks, all day long we'd buy the stock price at this level. Durgesh Chopra : Thank you. And then just maybe Dan, going back to the PTC the $100 million accretion gross margin. Can you is there a way for us to get to what a dollar PTC value you're usingm to get to that like an average across the different assets that you have? Dan Eggers : No, I'm not going to -- I'm kind of not in the place to give you a specific unit or price comparison because of the bus part [ph] differences of the plants. What I would say, you can look back at the sensitivities on 2023 at a plus or minus $5 movement and you can see how much the PTC would change from where we are. So you could price out, on those effectively four plants somewhat you could price out, how much move you would have to get the PTC back to zero. That's probably the best way of thinking about it right now. Durgesh Chopra : Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate that. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question And our next question comes from Ross Fowler of UBS. Your line is open. Joe Dominguez : Good morning, Ross. Ross Fowler : Good morning, Joe. Good morning, Dan. How are you. Joe Dominguez : Very good. Thank you. Ross Fowler : Congrats on the good quarter. Just Joe I heard your earlier comments and I just wanted to follow up on Paul's question, a little bit. So if I kind of -- look there's a lot of puts and takes left before we get to the fourth quarter call and sort of guidance for 2024. But if I kind of go back to Slide 25, where you're pointing us to and I kind of take gross margin, less the adjusted O&M and the TOTI, I'm sort of in that $3.7 billion $3.8 billion. Of course, there's a lot of puts and takes and there will be a range around that. But that's the context of your comments, that you're materially higher than consensus expectations because consensus is kind of $3.4 billion... Joe Dominguez : That's, right. Ross Fowler : Okay. Okay. Just wanted to make sure, I'm thinking about that correctly. Joe Dominguez : Yes, you got it. And look like I said, I think all the pieces are right there in front of you. Ross Fowler : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn it back to Joe Dominguez for final remarks. Joe Dominguez : Well, thanks again, for joining. It really has been kind of a remarkable quarter and the progress we've seen in the business, that points to really a nice outcome for us this year, and next is very exciting to all of us. So we look forward to our next quarterly call, and we'll conclude the call. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program you may all disconnect. And everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Constellation Energy Corporation Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder this call may be recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's call, Emily Duncan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Emily Duncan : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Constellation Energy Corporation's second quarter earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Joe Dominguez, Constellation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Eggers, Constellation's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Constellation's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Constellation's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we'll discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates regarding Constellation and its subsidiaries that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material, and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Constellation's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other circumstances and considerations that, may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. I'll now turn it over to Joe Dominguez, the CEO of Constellation. Joe Dominguez : Thanks, Emily. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I'm sorry about the delayed start here. I know it's a busy day for many of you, but it's a reminder of the old adage that all very good things are worth waiting for. I want to begin by thanking the women and men of Constellation for delivering a fantastic second quarter. It builds on the great work they did in the first quarter. For the second quarter, we earned $1.031 billion in adjusted EBITDA. As a result of the strong year-to-date results, and our expectations for the performance to continue, we are raising our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance range by $400 million to $3.3 billion to $3.7 billion, and we remain, despite this update, bullish for the balance of the year. What's more of the strong performance of the team is not limited to 2023. As you can see in the disclosures, it also reflects an increase in our 2024 gross margin update, which has increased by another $150 million on top of the $100 million increase you saw just a quarter ago, and we continue to find opportunity for further improvement. Our O&M remains on plan with the only material variance being the expected increase in employee compensation and profit sharing that comes with such an extraordinary year. Of course, Dan will discuss all of the drivers in more detail in his remarks, but the short story here is this. In Constellation, you own the largest and most reliable clean energy fleet in America as well as the best C&I and commercial platform in the business. We strategically couple these businesses with a strong balance sheet that, in turn, gives us a powerful competitive advantage across all retail and lower channels. It all translates into a unique ability to give our customers the certainty, and visibility they want on energy costs, and sustainability solutions, and ultimately leads to margin expansion and better value for you. In addition to the strong financial results I just touched upon, we had a great operational quarter, which I'll go through. We also had some exciting developments since our earnings - last earnings call, that should give you great confidence in the long-run strength of our company. First, we announced the acquisition of 44% of the dual unit South Texas Project Nuclear Station from NRG last month. This is an excellent asset. It's one of the youngest and largest in the country. And like our fleet, it has been well maintained. Regulatory approval has been filed with the NRC, and we expect to be able to close by the end of the year. Second, we announced a deal with Microsoft to provide them with an hourly time match clean energy product. It's the first agreement of its kind, and we think it will lead to many more. I'll cover the importance of that deal in a moment. Third, we reached an agreement with NYSERDA to share the value of the PTC with New York customers. New York was the first state to adopt the program that recognizes the unique value of clean, carbon-free nuclear energy. And so, it makes sense that they are first in receiving the benefits of the IRA. The resolution of this issue is exactly what we plan for. Fourth, at Constellation, you know that our mission is to accelerate the transition to a clean carbon-free future. But we think that natural gas is an important bridge fuel, and we have invested in technologies to make natural gas generation cleaner. In May, we set an industry record for blending hydrogen with natural gas at our Hillabee generating station to reduce emissions. The test showed that with only minor modifications, an existing natural gas plant, I think this plant is a little bit over 15 years old. That kind of technology can safely operate on a blend of nearly 40% clean hydrogen and 60% natural gas, nearly doubling the previous blending record for similar generation stations. As many of you know, EPA's proposed regulations for reducing carbon emissions from gas power plants depends upon clean hydrogen blending, and we just showed that it works. In addition, we have worked on gas generation with carbon capture technologies that have the potential of making natural gas generation truly carbon-free. We have been investors and collaborators in net power and at CCUS technology for many years. We were pleased to see the successful launch of this publicly traded company with our stake presently valued at over $450 million. These accomplishments and many more are laid out in our second sustainability report that, we published last month. It details how Constellation and its customers are leading the fight against the climate crisis. I commend this important report to your reading. Now, before I turn to the quarterly operational updates, let me remind you that we just launched this company. August 2 marked the first 18 months of our business. And I think folks would be hard-pressed to find a better launch, and we appreciate you being on that journey with you. Let me turn to Slide 6. We saw strong performance across our generation fleet during the quarter, meeting or exceeding our operational targets, and we have continued to see good performance in July. That's one of the reasons we have such confidence in the updates, we're providing you today. Our nuclear plants had a second quarter capacity factor of 92.4%, looks, that's even with five refueling outages during the quarter. And these outages were completed in less than 24 days on average. By the way, just for context, that's two weeks less time than the industry average for refuels, scale matters. Our power assets have exceeded their plan, delivering a dispatch match of 99.1%, meaning they were available just that every time they were called. Our Texas fleet continues to meet the challenge of extreme heat this summer, putting needed power on the grid and allowing us to capture additional value from the higher prices that we are seeing. And lastly, our renewables fleet performed near plan despite the lower wind speed that it seems just about everyone is talking about. Turning to Slide 7. As I mentioned, our commercial business is driving the outperformance this year, because of the way that we optimize our positions across both the generation and the load portfolios to create additional gross margin. We saw just that during the quarter. The team also continues to have success in helping our customers meet their sustainability needs. But this quarter, our team made history of setting a new bar for corporate procurements. As I touched upon previously, in June, we reached a landmark agreement with Microsoft that combines the environmental attributes of nuclear power with renewable energy to produce a time-match clean energy solution for Microsoft. This agreement enables one of the Microsoft's facilities that time-match clean energy production and energy use in order to operate on nearly 100% clean power every single hour of the day. Matching clean energy production to the exact moment when a customer uses energy is essential to reaching carbon reduction goals while maintaining electric reliability. You'll recall that the first generation of clean energy accounting rules as well as state clean energy programs allowed customers to claim that they are reducing emissions even when the credits they're buying are from electricity produced in faraway regions or at a completely different day, time or even year. In effect, we were allowing people to take RECs from April and pretend that it was offsetting energy consumption in July or August. People were buying RECs from Texas and pretending it was deliverable in New England or the Mid-Atlantic to meet sustainability goals. Now to be fair, this approach was a good starting point, but leaves a large gap between stated emissions and reduction goals and actual emissions reductions. Unfortunately, it also sent the wrong message. It told developers to build generation in places where customers are not located and encourage them to produce energy at times customers don't need it. Among other things, that mismatch in time and location, has led to the enormous interconnection problems that we're really seeing across the nation and which, in our opinion, will only get worse. It is a tough problem, but the answer is simple. In order to meet the - climate crisis head on and preserve electric reliability, we need clean energy that predictively operates so that - output is time-matched to customer demand. As we see in Europe and elsewhere, clean energy, time and geographic matching is where energy policy and corporate sustainabilities must go. The leading sustainability companies in the nation and the world's governments and NGOs get that. Constellation and Microsoft are leading by example with this landmark agreement. It shows that time matching works, and it shows that nuclear energy in combination with renewable energy can make it all happen. Basically, nuclear fills the gap when the wind isn't flowing and when the sun doesn't shine. And that produces a solution that cannot be matched by renewables alone. Having Microsoft, one of the world's sustainability leaders, recognizing the value of nuclear as a sustainability solution that will lead to even better environmental outcomes is a very big deal. It paves the way for others to follow. And - this is the way I think about it. 2022 will always be remembered as the year in which the federal government finally began to put nuclear energy in the high echelon of premium, clean energy products that must be supported by policy as a national priority. I believe that 2023 will go down as the year in which large customers began to think the same way and recognize the reality that including nuclear energy and sustainability solutions leads to even better outcomes. My compliments to the Microsoft team and their vision. We're glad to have them both as a partner and as a customer. I'll now turn it over to Dan, for a more detailed update on the financial outlook. Dan? Dan Eggers : Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 8. As Joe mentioned, we continue to see strong performance from the business that is driving our earnings results, and expectations for the year. We earned $1.031 billion in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, which compares to $603 million last year. We realized higher prices on our generation output compared to 2022, and the commercial team had another exceptional quarter. They captured significant value from higher margins, successful load auction wins and through optimization of the portfolio as volatility in the market persisted through the second quarter. The volatility creates opportunities to help our customers who are looking for certainty in their costs, and we can provide where others cannot, in part due to our strong investment-grade balance sheet. Volatility also leads to higher unit margins as risk is more appropriately priced in and we can optimize our positions across our load serving and generation businesses, which creates additional value. This performance flowed through our quarterly results and also improved our expectations for the remainder of the year, which I will discuss in a few minutes. In addition to the strong performance of our team this quarter, we recognized $218 million of EBITDA from the Illinois ZEC program for the full 2023-2024 planning year covering June of this year through May of next year. As some of you may recall from when the legislation was passed, the Illinois ZEC program is subject to an overall cost cap as one of its consumer protection features. Over the course of the program to-date, that cost cap has been reached in each planning year. And thus, we had ZECs that were produced, but we are not compensated for. We all allows for this revenue to be banked and compensated in a subsequent planning year when the cost cap is not reached. For the 2023-2024 planning year, the ZEC price is $0.30 per megawatt hour. And so for the first time, the cost cap will not be reached. Therefore, some of those uncompensated ZECs from prior years will be recovered in this cycle up to the level of the overall cost cap. Our gross margin tables for 2023 and 2024 have already included the use of banked ZECs on a ratable basis over the planning year. However, accounting rules require us to instead recognize the full planning years banked revenues at the beginning of the planning year, which caused us to recognize the $218 million in June, and therefore, pulling forward some revenues into full year 2023 from 2024. So the change in timing is now reflected in our updated gross margin tables for both 2023 and 2024. To put all of this in context, Clinton and Quad Cities have received an average realized price for energy, capacity and ZECs of $40 to $45 per megawatt hour during the first six years of the program. Looking forward, we forecast energy capacity in ZECs to be at least at PTC levels over the remaining life of the ZEC program. As a refresher, Slide 19 in the appendix provides more details on the mechanics of the Illinois ZEC program. Turning to Slide 9 and our gross margin outlook. We've increased our gross margin forecast for 2023 and 2024, incorporating the strong execution and performance, Joe and I have discussed. For 2023, total gross margin increased by $350 million. The increase primarily reflects our performance in our commercial business, strong margins, higher customer win rates and opportunities created by the sustained volatility in commodity markets. As a result, we executed $400 million of our power new business target. This benefit is seen on the table in the mark-to-market of hedges line as executed business moves out of the power to go line. In addition, we raised our new business target by $300 million based on our expectations to continue to create value during the remainder of the year. Our contracted revenue line also increased by about $100 million due to the Illinois ZEC timing, I just covered. In 2024, our total gross margin, including PTCs is $9.2 billion, up $150 million from our last update. Lower prices were offset by an increase in expected nuclear PTCs from plants without existing ZEC programs, reinforcing the downside protection the PTC provides against declining power prices. Consistent with what we are seeing in 2023, the favorable margin trends with our C&I customers and load auctions are showing up in business being contracted into 2024. This favorability is supporting the $150 million increase in our overall 2024 gross margin outlook. Our disclosures currently do not reflect the STP acquisition. Following our typical practice, we will include them once we have closed the transaction and expect STP will be included in our fourth quarter disclosures. Moving to Slide 10. We are raising our full year EBITDA guidance outlook by $400 million to a $3.5 billion midpoint to a new range of $3.3 billion to $3.7 billion. This upward revision reflects the significant increase to our gross margin forecast since the beginning of the year, which was slightly offset by an increase to our O&M driven by increased compensation for our employees due to the strong financial performance of the company this year. Turning to financing and liquidity update on Slide 11. Our strong balance sheet is critical to our business model, allowing us to participate in volatile markets in ways that many others cannot. It also supports our capital allocation strategy, providing us with options from organic and inorganic growth to capital return. Keeping in step with this advantage, Moody's upgraded its outlook from stable to positive during the quarter, referencing our balance sheet strength and recognition of the commodity - price downside protection provided by the PTC. We want to thank our colleagues and Moody's for their thoughtfulness and we look forward to continued productive conversations. Our credit metrics remain on target and well above our downgrade thresholds. As we discussed during the STP announcement call, we plan to issue debt later this year to fund the transaction, which we expect to close by year-end. We continue to execute on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, and have now completed half of the $1 billion buyback program authorized by our Board in February. We purchased an additional 3 million shares through the end of the second quarter, including through June. We continue to see our stock as attractive at these levels, and we'll be opportunistic for the remainder of the authorized program. We still have an additional $1.2 billion of unallocated capital in 2023 and 2024 to create additional shareholder value through growth investments, M&A or additional return of capital to our owners. I'll now turn the call back to Joe for his closing remarks. Joe Dominguez : Thanks, Dan. That's a good summary. Folks, this management team remains focused on creating value for our shareholders. Our business is unique, and we continue to have many opportunities in front of us to create incremental value for our investors. As you know, we're the best operator of nuclear plants, and the largest producer of carbon-free electricity in the United States. Our commercial business serves nearly 25% of the competitive C&I market in the United States and is helping our customers, like Microsoft, meet their sustainability goals through products like our hourly matching product. Our businesses are essential to addressing the climate crisis and our assets are durable. The Inflation Reduction Act provides unique opportunities for Constellation and its investors. We believe, we will be able to use nuclear energy to produce hydrogen. We will be able to relicense our nuclear fleet to run at least 80 years without needing to replace it. And the IRA provides, at long last, the long-term commitment that nuclear energy is part of the national security of this great nation. And we have many ways to grow and bring more value to our shareholders. Against the baseline earnings level supported by the PTC floor over the length of the PTC, we will benefit from floor price inflation. If you're a believer that 2% inflation for the U.S. is going to be hard to reach, then you should like this company a great deal. We generate strong free cash flow that can be used to fund robust organic growth at double-digit unlevered returns, disciplined M&A like the STP deal, fund a growing dividend and buyback stock. We're doing all those things already. We've announced a $1.5 billion growth in uprates, hydrogen and wind repowering, doubled the per share dividend and have bought back approximately $500 million of our own stock as part of the authorized $1 billion buyback. And as Dan mentioned, there's more we can do. We have $1.2 billion of unallocated capital in '23 and '24 that can be used to further enhance our earnings growth in the ways that I've outlined. Constellation is in unique form that cannot be matched anywhere in the marketplace. Our large clean carbon-free nuclear fleet paired with our customer-facing business provides us with opportunities to grow and create value for our shareholders. And that's what we're focused on. Now, Dan and I and the rest of the management team, look forward to your questions. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Joe Dominguez : Good morning, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Yes. Hi. Good morning. I guess couple questions. Just on the credit metric slide, the numbers are kind of the same as the last quarter. Are you not yet including the higher assumed guidance for '23 in there? Dan Eggers : Correct. Yes, Steve. The way we've approached that slide is we refresh it, once a year when we give our full plan for numbers. So the metrics are in there, I'll tell you that, yes given the strength in earnings this year that would certainly look favorable, before we put STP and time to watch. So that - we do not include updates to our numbers in credit metrics or the cash available as we go through the years. So favorability, we've seen in '23 and '24 would be added to the numbers we talk about. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then, I guess, secondly, maybe just a little more kind of color or thought process on the sustainability of this improved environment for wholesale retail margins. You kind of talked about what's driving it. A little more color of what's driving it and just how you're thinking about the sustainability of it beyond? I know some of it's into '24, but even beyond that? Joe Dominguez : Yes, sure, Steve. I mean, first of all, think about the duration of our products that we typically sell on the market are one year products. We're selling for 30 months or more in the case of load following options. So this is - the deals we're entering into are going to persist for a while. I think that the margin expansion is really - and I'm going to invite Jim McHugh, the Head of our Commercial Group, to chime in here. It's a reflection of the volatility we've seen in the market. And in turn, I think that volatility is a reflection of the changing composition of the generation fleet and kind of saw that this - summer in Texas, where you have - home prices and all of a sudden, you have less wind or renewable output and prices spiked asymmetrically really high levels and make it real difficult for companies that don't have our balance sheet and our generation capabilities to handle. Frankly, the impact - the financial impact of that volatility and cover themselves. That's a new phenomenon. And I think that's going to do nothing, but increase settings. Honestly, Steve, I think reserve margins are about as thick as they're going to be in these markets, and as you see fossil generation being replaced with renewable generation. The underlying markets are going to be very volatile, and it's going to take a special kind of company with a special balance sheet to cover that. I think the sustainability solutions also allow us to enter into longer deals with customers that really want that sort of product support. So look, I think this is durable. I think margins will always increase and contract over time. But what we're seeing here is, what I think is going to be a durable long-term trend. And Jim, why don't you get into some of the specifics of what you're seeing? James McHugh : Sure. Yes. Thanks, Joe. And Steve, I think adding some color on the duration of the contracts, if you think about in addition - to the contract as we sign is the duration of the customer. We tend to hold customers for at least five years when once we get them signed up when you think about retention. So that's another sign towards durability. I think, the macro trends on volatility with - has load and electrification hit and low growth continues or starts to really pick up. Combining with the supply side changes that Joe talked about on the intermittent seen and other things on the generation side, volatility in multiple of these markets, we think, is going to continue in the next several year window, PJM, Texas, New England, New York. So, I think that optimization activity is durable also. And then - to me, the last thing I would add is the year, as you talked about '23 and we've talked about '24. We definitely see some of this margin also now going into 2025 as we sign up these customers, and the activity we're seeing in the market. So, we expect that to be there over the next few years on the gross margin optimization also. And then, the macro trend of sustainability products is something that you add to that as it scales in the future. We've talked about our core product quite a bit with you all. The amount of volumes, we're seeing there and the margins have been continuing to grow. And now we have the possibility with hourly CFE, carbon-free energy matching to look at the next wave of sustainability products to get our customers signed up for longer terms and for decent margins. So, we're feeling good about the sustainability environment, and it really does start with the balance sheet. Our competitiveness is there. I think others in this interest rate environment with the collateral costs and the borrowing costs hit, quite do what we can do. So, I think it's - we're feeling good about it. Steve Fleishman : Great. Thanks. I have one more question. That was very helpful. Just - can you maybe update us on your thoughts on the green hydrogen IRA credit treatment? And I guess, aligned with that, how are you thinking about choosing, between you're producing green hydrogen from nuclear or these 24/7 contracts like this? Just, can you maybe go through your thought process on how you're prioritizing among those? Joe Dominguez : Yes. Let me - kind of go at it a little backwards and cover your second question first. So, when you think about the time match product we just sold to Microsoft. It's the same sort of product that is going to enable also - the hydrogen production at a customer location, right? So, if you have a refinery, a processing center, if you're distributing hydrogen, and you don't want to make it, for example, behind the fence line of a nuclear plant transported, you can cite the electrolyzer directly at the customer's location. And then, we would sell that customer, time-matched clean energy that would allow that customer to get the tax credit, and we would earn some of the value of that tax credit and the transaction in these longer-term deals that Jim is talking about. So, it can be a separate product. It can be sold. The 24/7 product can be sold to a Microsoft like company for sustainability reasons, but it could also be sold to enable hydrogen production at the customer location, so-called grid connected hydrogen. In terms of how we see the current discussions going on in treasury, let me just start with this, Steve. The language of statute is clear that existing nuclear plants are allowed to earn a tax credit for producing hydrogen. There's no other way to read it. And frankly, when Congress intends something like, for example, only new resources would be allowed to earn the tax credit, Congress is well aware of how to write that and explain that in the statute. I think Senators Manchin, Senator Carper, who just came out very publicly this week, are exactly right that there was never an agreement on additionality, let alone even a discussion of additionality when this bill was passed. And so to the extent from a regulatory standpoint, people intend to impose that requirement, we believe it will be defeated in court. But I don't think we're going to get there. We're having very productive conversations with the administration about means of addressing this from a regulatory standpoint, so that existing nuclear can begin to be used to make hydrogen and relicensed nuclear plants would effectively count as new. I think those conversations are productive, not only, because Democratic allies in Congress are saying what they're saying about this never came up in the process. But also the fact that think about it, with nuclear, the other tiers of the strategy they're trying to achieve, time match, geographic matching already are there. We could do that immediately tomorrow. We could start having these contracts and electrolytes which running on time match regionally matched electricity. And we're going to have to do this, because for things like the EPA regulations that I mentioned earlier. That say, for example, that existing natural gas should blend with hydrogen, you'll never ever create that much hydrogen by the deadlines that EPA is seeking unless you allow these existing resources to begin making hydrogen with megawatts that, frankly, are in surplus at different times of the year. So look, I think we've made all of those arguments. We continue those discussions. I don't want to get into the nitty-gritty on these calls of the exact content of those discussions, because I think it will be counterproductive. But I feel confident. And if at the end of the day, those discussions don't go the way we expect, then we'll use the Board's to achieve the line. And I'm quite confident that we will be successful. Steve Fleishman : Super helpful. Thanks so much. Joe Dominguez : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shar Pourreza : Hi. Good morning, guys. Joe Dominguez : Good morning. Shar Pourreza : Joe, I just wanted to follow-up on Steve's question, and just drill down a little bit on the ongoing gross margin outperformance we've seen so far this year, and in particular, on the quarter. The retail margin expansion is pretty straightforward. You guys have talked about it a lot this morning. But where have you seen the wholesale outperformance? It seems like you were, very hedged as of last quarter. Is it primarily the ERCOT CCGTs? Just some more color there, if you can? Thanks. Joe Dominguez : Sure. Shar, let me give it over to Jim. James McHugh : Sure. Yes. Good morning, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Thank you. James McHugh : I would start with wholesale load customers, too. I know you've had a focus on our retail customer base. But on the wholesale side, we've also had decent really good strong performance in wholesale loads. Whether that be load auctions to utility companies, but also structured origination contracts with other large entities and municipals and co-ops. So, we've seen the ability to go sign up customers for load contracts on the wholesale side, too. So that's part of the wholesale story. The second one is on the optimization activity, to your point, is really been around kind of this volatility assessment. And just the decisions we need to make every hour, every day, every month, every week, as you see the price movements and load and weather movements where we can kind of optimize the portfolio, by setting up the imbalances in the right way of where our generation is, and where our load delivered contracts are. So that's been also a significant driver of it. So that is the one we're saying, we expect to continue, because we've had this track record when you see these markets moving around and being volatile. This is where we've seen this before. This isn't kind of the first time, we've seen wholesale success in volatile markets. And we just expect that these markets are going to continue to exhibit this behavior, based on just the changing stack dynamics. So, I think its customer business and optimization activity, both that are driving that. Shar Pourreza : Fantastic. Helpful. And then, Joe, just on STP, I know - I realize you guys are somewhat removed from the legal situation between their current owners, and I appreciate the comments in the prepareds. But any additional color you could provide on your timing expectation right now, and how we should be thinking about the potential redeployment of that $1.75 billion if, for like whatever reason, this becomes a more serious roadblock? Joe Dominguez : Yes, Shar. I'm not even to the second one because, frankly, I think the claims are meritless and will be discussed by a court. To the extent we find any extra capital in our plan, we'll use it for the things we've talked about, double-digit growth opportunities. And if they don't happen, and we don't have any inorganic growth opportunities at that time, we're going to look to deploy value back to our owners. And Dan and I have not been shy about saying, we very much like the value of the company, and buying back shares at these price levels. As I said it on the first quarter call, when the price was in the 70s that we would buy all day long at those prices, and I feel the same way today. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. And then just lastly from me, I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks, Joe, your dialogue with the New York on net ZECs. Can we just expand on the mechanics of what that will look like going forward? Is there actually uplift from the transition to the PTC? Thank you, guys. Joe Dominguez : Yes. Sure. Shar, let me give - let me introduce you to Dave Dardis, our General Counsel, who negotiated the provisions of that agreement and is best to answer the details question. David Dardis : Yes. Thank you. Well, first, obviously, New York was the first state to recognize the value of nuclear and what it did for its customers, both from a sustainability perspective as well as managing prices. And so that program was historic. And we've been a strong partner of the state all along under that program. New York also was able to negotiate a provision in the PTC, which basically ignores the ZEC payments for purposes of calculating the PTC. And in working with New York, what we've agreed to under the amendment we made under a change in law provision of our existing contract is that the ZEC program will be reduced dollar-for-dollar for every dollar of PTC, we would otherwise be eligible for them. Shar Pourreza : Perfect. I think that was helpful, guys. Hi, congrats on this execution. Appreciate it. Joe Dominguez : Thanks, Shar. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Joe Dominguez : Hi. Good morning, David. David Arcaro : Hi. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. Joe, what have your conversations been like at the policy level around on-shoring nuclear fuel production? Just curious where you see that going and what's the latest there? Joe Dominguez : Yes. I think there's some bits of good developments. So, I'm going to turn it over to Kathleen Barron who Heads Strategy and will share for us to give an update on. Kathleen Barron : Yes. Good morning. We have had some good developments on that front. As you know, we have been encouraging Congress to allocate funding to improve domestic enrichment and conversion services in the U.S. And in July, there was a vote taken in the Senate to include the Nuclear Fuel Security Act into the NDAA as sort of a must-pass bill for this year to fund the military. So a little bit outside the scope of that topic. But given the importance of this issue, that provision was added in a vote of 96 to three, which does include $3.5 billion in funding to go to the DOE, again, to spur new conversion and enrichment capacity in the U.S. That was one of several provisions that were positive towards nuclear that were added into the bill. There was an extension of Price-Anderson by 20 years, streamlining of NRC review of new reactors and additional funding for domestic sources of fuel. So, it may be one of the last remaining issues that's bipartisan in the Senate, but continued support for the nuclear industry is certainly something that with behind those three provisions, and we think it's a good signal for how Congress and federal policymakers are thinking about our business. David Arcaro : Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just looking back to what your expectations were around nuclear fuel cost heading into this year. How has that been tracking in terms of market pricing of nuclear fuel and your ability to lock that and going forward? And then a kind of similar topic just on O&M trends this year, how is your overall O&M expense been following against your earlier guidance? Dan Eggers : Hi, Dave. This is Dan. On the nuclear fuel side, we laid out on the fourth quarter earnings call that we were procuring fuel to make sure that even if we were to not have our rush deliveries executed on, we'd have enough fuel how to use through 2028. I can tell you these actions have continued to deliver on schedules. We're in a better position than we were coming into the year. We're very happy about that. I feel very confident about - the confident in all of our deliveries. As we look out, we'll continue to execute on that plan. We also shared with you that you having up to 2028, our nuclear fuel cost will still be below $6 a megawatt an hour through our income statement, and that remains on track. So that's all in good shape. As far as O&M is concerned, we are on plan, I'd say, with our core O&M that Joe hit on in his prepared remarks, you'll see a bit of an increase in our disclosures. That has to do with profit sharing and other incentives associated with the significant outperformance we're having in 2023. When you look at 2024 in that same table, you'll see that will be consistent with year-end. So, we're of course comfortable with our projections. David Arcaro : Got you. Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Joe Dominguez : Thanks, David. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo with Bank of America. Joe Dominguez : Good morning, Paul. Paul Zimbardo : Hi. Good morning, team. Thank you. Just to follow-up on Shar's question briefly. In terms of the New York agreement with the ZEC and the PTC play, how would that change the cash tax rate, whether for 2024 or beyond? Just, I think that there's some savings from pretax to post tax there? Thanks. Dan Eggers : Paul, I think we're probably not going to be in a place to give you specifics on cash tax rate. There's a lot of things that are going to move period-to-period with CapEx, plus depreciation, our timing of the cash taxes that Exelon is to load back, they still owes us at this point in time. There's a lot of pieces that will go into it as well as the PTC timing. So, I probably wouldn't isolate its one particular issue. I think the forecasts we have are pretty solid at this point in time. Paul Zimbardo : Okay. But at least just generically, if you kind of - the New York agreement and if you do things in other states, is it right to think that should be cash tax savings prospectively? Dan Eggers : I think there could be an opportunity when we look at our cash tax go over time to get more effective, and this could be a good use of it. Paul Zimbardo : Okay. Great. And then quickly going back to the Microsoft deal, very interesting to see that one. The nuclear energy, whether it's - the energy certificates, the CFCs, are those coming from Constellation nuclear plants or different nuclear plants to serve Microsoft? Just curious there? James McHugh : Yes. Paul, it's Jim. They are coming from Constellation nuclear plants. And the geography how we are matching and the geography are both pieces of the nuclear plants that will source the hours by which Microsoft will buy nuclear power from us. Paul Zimbardo : Okay. Great. Thanks team. Joe Dominguez : Thanks, Paul. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Joe Dominguez for closing remarks. Joe Dominguez : Well, thanks again, everybody, for joining the call. We'll end the call now and get back to work. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Constellation Energy Corporation Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Emily Duncan, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin. Emily Duncan : Thank you, Abigail. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Constellation Energy Corporation's Third Quarter Earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Joe Dominguez, Constellation's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Dan Eggers, Constellation's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Constellation's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Constellation's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates regarding Constellation and its subsidiaries that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Constellation's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other circumstances and considerations that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO of Constellation, Joe Dominguez. Joe Dominguez : Thanks, Emily. Thanks to the operator for getting us started. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I apologize if the quality of the audio isn't great. We are all, if you could believe it, sitting around Emily Duncan's cell phone here because we lost a trunk line into the building. But as you could see from our numbers, pretty much everything else is going well around here. I want to begin by thanking the good people of Constellation for delivering an awesome third quarter. They continued the strong performance from the first half of the year and they are the best at what they do. For the third quarter, we earned $1.199 billion in adjusted EBITDA. As a result of this continued strong performance, we are again raising our full year guidance range to $3.8 billion to $4 billion. The strength is not limited to 2023, and you will see in our disclosures that we have raised our 2024 gross margin by $250 million. I want to emphasize here that STP is not yet in our final disclosures for 2024. As you recall, we estimated the average STP EBITDA contribution to be an incremental $190 million per year with 2024 a little lower due to the fact that we have an extra outage every third year. And as it so happens, 2024 is one of those years. However, we believe that the impact of that extra outage will be offset by the higher Texas energy prices we have seen since we've announced the transaction. So we're back to an estimated $190 million for 2024 with 2025 looking even better. We will provide all of the STP and other updated financials in our fourth quarter call. We talked about this before, but it bears repeating. Constellation owns the largest and most reliable clean energy fleet in the country and has the best C&I and commercial platform in the business. We strategically couple these businesses with a strong balance sheet that, in turn, gives us a powerful competitive advantage across retail and wholesale channels. It translates into a unique ability to give our customers the certainty and visibility that they want on energy costs as well as to provide to them sustainability solutions. All of that ultimately leads to margin expansion and creates value for you. Before I turn to the operational performance, I want to talk about some exciting developments since our last call. First, as I noted earlier, we closed ahead of schedule on our acquisition of 44% of the South Texas Project, expanding our clean, reliable annual nuclear production to approximately 180 million megawatt hours. We're looking forward to working and forging a strong relationship with our new co-owners, Austin Energy and CPS. This includes working to resolve pending litigation and explore mutually beneficial opportunities to improve performance. I talked last quarter about the fact that an average outage at STP lasts around 31 days. At Byron, we just completed an outage for a very similar machine in 17 days. And if you think that's amazing, consider that we just completed the Peach Bottom outage in 13 days. I was happy to see that, Bryan Hanson, our Chief Generation Officer, was named as Chairman of the STP Board and will begin immediately to realize some of the opportunities we see in that asset. The second development I want to highlight is that the US Department of Energy awarded a $1 billion grant to the Midwest Hydrogen Hub, which includes our hydrogen project at LaSalle. A portion of this award will offset our cost for the project. The award is proof that the DOE and the administration want existing nuclear energy to play a vital role in jump-starting domestic clean hydrogen production. However, it remains critical that the Treasury Department guidance confirms that using existing nuclear energy to produce hydrogen qualifies for the full clean energy production tax credit. Certainly, we think that the hub award is a good sign, but we need to see the right rules or the hub won't happen. Third, we signed a deal with ComEd to power its facility with hourly matched clean free -- carbon-free energy, which I'll cover in more detail in a few minutes. And finally, probably the most exciting thing is that we earned a 2023 Great Place to Work certification. Really proud of this because it's based on how our employees rate their experience at Constellation. 5,000 of our colleagues participated in the survey and 81% of them said that Constellation is a great place to work. That's 24 percentage points higher than the average US company. Our people are talented, hard-working and they're passionate about what they do, and that shows up in our results over and over again. Our culture and our mission is also an asset in attracting the best talent in the market. We've onboarded 3,000 new colleagues since separation and that's pretty incredible for a workforce of about 14,000 people. Now I'll turn to the quarterly operational updates, starting on Slide 6. During the hottest summer on record, our fleet helped to support the grid and ensure that American families can cool their homes and that businesses have the electricity to power our economy. Our nuclear plants had a third quarter capacity factor of 97.2% but they ran at nearly 100% during June, July and August. The only reason we're at 97.2% is that, in September we started our planned refueling outages. Our power and renewable assets also ran extremely well. Our Texas fleet, which includes state-of-the-art CCGTs, produced 1.4 million megawatt hours more this year than last year, supporting ERCOT during an extremely challenging summer. This summer, ERCOT was affected not only by extreme heat, but by unprecedented load and the impacts of a changing resource mix. For example, during the summer, ERCOT had 49 days with a peak higher than 80 gigawatts, exceeding the all-time summer peak demand set in '22 and exceeding 2021's peak by nearly 11.8 gigawatts or an incredible 16%. The system is constrained not just at peak, but in the hours after peak due to the intermittent output that comprises much of its generation portfolio. As the grid continues to change, we expect these conditions to amplify, and challenges could occur at any hour. The changes in ERCOT stack and the hours of challenging operating conditions will increase the importance of dispatchable generation and particularly clean, reliable, dispatchable generation. The quality of our gas fleet, coupled with our newly acquired STP assets, sets us up for great success. I want to send a special thank you to the people who operate our nuclear and power fleets for all that they do. Now let me move to Slide 7. The success of the Commercial business is the foundation for our financial performance. This year, they knocked the cover off the ball. We're able to optimize our positions across both the generation and customer portfolios to create additional gross margin. And we can provide our customers certainty on energy bills in volatile times, which leads to margin expansion. We're also leading the way on sustainability solutions. In the second quarter, we spent time talking about the Microsoft deal where we use nuclear and renewable energy to produce a time-matched clean energy product. We continue to see very strong interest in this product. This quarter, we're excited to announce an agreement with one of the largest utilities in the country, ComEd, to power its facilities with hourly match carbon-free energy from nuclear power. Microsoft and ComEd are both sustainability leaders, and we're thrilled to be able to help them move forward in their efforts to address the climate crisis through the recognition of the importance of 24/7 carbon-free electricity made by nuclear energy. Matching regionally produced clean energy to the exact moment when a customer uses energy is essential to reaching carbon reduction goals while maintaining electric reliability and affordability. That is why our nuclear fleet is essential today and will be even more valuable tomorrow. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan for the financial update. Dan Eggers : Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 8, as Joe mentioned, the business continues to perform extremely well. We earned $1.199 billion in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, which compares to $592 million in the third quarter of last year. Our commercial organization continued with the success we have seen over recent quarters. Our renewal rates have been strong and margins remain above historical levels as market volatility and the desire of customers to control their budgets have created opportunity for our team. As we've discussed on prior calls, the volatility in commodity markets and higher interest rates are leading to more appropriate risk pricing by our competitors. These market conditions create opportunity for us to optimize our combined portfolio of generation and load, which we see in results for 2023. And as we look out to '24 and '25 with favorable gross margin uplift that I'll talk about in a moment. On the generation front, our nuclear and power fleet performed extremely well during a record-setting hot summer. As Joe said, our nuclear fleet ran full out during June, July and August. And as a result of the extreme heat and load growth in Texas, ERCOT set 10 new peak demand records during the summer. In addition to record peaks, we observed more significant operating conditions in the subsequent hours after the peak load due to low intermittent output and a stretched thermal fleet which, at times, resulted in prices above $1,000 a megawatt hour and with a $5,000 cap for a few hours. Investments we made in our Texas fleet in advance of summer ensured we were ready to help support the grid when the plants were needed, and they ran more than they did the previous year. Through September, our Texas plants ran 13% more than they did last year. Turning to Slide 9 and our gross margin outlook. We have increased our gross margin forecast for 2023 and 2024, incorporating the continued strong execution and performance Joe and I have discussed. For 2023, total gross margin increased by $400 million to $9.2 billion. Our projected gross margin is now $850 million higher than our expectations when we began the year, reinforcing the unparalleled operating environment we have seen this year. In 2024, our total gross margin including PTCs is $9.45 billion. Total gross margin increased by $250 million from our last update. Market prices increased across the major regions relative to last quarter. As a result, we expect to earn less nuclear PTC revenues at our four plants without state support due to higher expected gross receipts. Turning to our Commercial business. As we renew existing contracts and enter into new ones, we are seeing the favorable margin trends with our C&I customers and load auctions extending out into 2025. We have seen some moderation in margins from highs earlier this year and more participants in load auctions, but see opportunity for these margin trends to continue for some time as we anticipate sustained commodity market volatility, in part, due to the changing composition of the generation stack. With the strength of our balance sheet, along with our integrated generation and load business, we are well positioned during this volatile environment to continue meeting our customers' needs while also creating value for our shareholders. Moving to Slide 10. We are raising our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance outlook by $400 million to a $3.9 billion midpoint and narrowing the range to $3.8 billion to $4 billion. This upward revision reflects the significant increase to our gross margin forecast since the beginning of the year. And as we flagged last quarter, the gross margin upside is somewhat tampered by an increase to O&M, driven primarily by increased compensation for our employees, including stock compensation due to the strong financial performance of the company. I should note that considering that we just closed the STP acquisition last week, our gross margin and cost forecast do not yet reflect STP. We'll layer that plant into our year-end disclosures. That said, our updated EBITDA guidance for 2023 includes STP for November and December, which is a relatively small part of the increase to our guidance. And as Joe mentioned in his remarks, we anticipate contribution from STP to at least meet the $190 million of EBITDA starting in 2024, which again is not reflected in the gross margin or cost disclosures in our earnings materials today. Turning to the financing and liquidity update on Slide 11. To help fund the STP transaction, we issued $1.4 billion of debt, including $900 million of 30-year and $500 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes. We saw significant demand with order books peaking at seven times across both tranches. We also achieved very tight pricing when we look at both spreads to treasuries and between the 10 and 30-year tranches, pricing competitively with recent utility holding company transactions. We appreciate the support from our fixed income owners and the vote of confidence in the long-term need for our assets into the 2050s and well into their next licensed lives to 80 years. As we stated at the time of the announcement, the transaction will be credit-neutral and a debt issuance did not strain our forward credit metrics. In fact, our credit metrics are now projected to be at or above the 35% at Moody's and 45% in S&P that we laid out at the beginning of the year due to the additional cash flows captured in our earnings guidance. We continue to execute on our commitments to return capital to our shareholders. Completed another $250 million of share buybacks during the third quarter. When we look at the opportunities ahead of us, we still see our stock is attractive at current levels and will continue to be opportunistic with the remaining $250 million authorized by our Board. As we discussed in June, we have $1.2 billion of unallocated capital for 2023 and 2024, which will be used to create additional shareholder value through growth investments, M&A or return of capital to our owners. I should remind you that this $1.2 billion is based on our disclosures at year-end 2022 that we shared on the fourth quarter call and does not reflect any additional cash created by this year's outperformance and upward revisions to next year's expectations. We'll provide an updated view of all this on our fourth quarter call. I'll turn the call back now to Joe for his closing remarks. Joe Dominguez : Thanks, Dan. So the management team here remains focused on creating value for our shareholders. You know our business is unique, and we continue to have many unique opportunities in front of us. As you know, we're the best operator of nuclear plants and the largest producer of carbon-free electricity in the US. And now with STP, we'll make more than 180 million-megawatt hours annually just from our nuclear fleet. Our Commercial business serves more than 22% of the competitive C&I market in the United States and is helping customers like Microsoft and ComEd meet their sustainability goals through products like our hourly matching product. Our businesses are essential to addressing the climate crisis and our assets are durable. The IRA provides long-term commitment to nuclear energy as part of the national security of this great nation. We have many ways to grow and bring even more value to our shareholders against a baseline earnings level supported by the PTC. And over the life of the PTC, we'll benefit from price war inflation. We have opportunities ahead of us to create additional value for the clean, reliable nuclear energy that we provide like hydrogen, data centers and expanding our hourly matched product. We have ability to relicense our nuclear fleet to run at least 80 years without needing to replace it. We have many ways to grow and bring more value to shareholders. We generate strong free cash flow that could be used to fund robust organic growth at double-digit unlevered returns, pursue disciplined M&A, support our growing dividend and buyback our stock. Each of these opportunities will create additional value for you, our owners and we're executing on that strategy. We closed the STP deal. We announced $1.5 billion in growth spend in operates, hydrogen and wind repowering. We doubled the per share dividend, and we bought back approximately $750 million of our own stock as part of an authorized $1 billion buyback plan, and there's more we can do. We have significant unallocated capital in '23 and '24, as Dan just outlined, and we could use those monies to further enhance our earnings growth and provide value to you. Constellation cannot be matched anywhere in the market. Our large clean carbon-free nuclear fleet, paired with our customer-facing business and strong balance sheet provides us with unparalleled opportunities to create value for you. And that's what we're focused on. Now we, as a management team, stand ready to address your questions. Thanks, operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Joe Dominguez : Good morning, David. David Arcaro : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Wondering if you could elaborate a bit on what you're seeing in the competitive environment in retail just in terms of churn and any changes in market share as you're experiencing higher margins there? Joe Dominguez : Dan, I'm going to -- Dan covered a bit of this in his prepared remarks and I'll let him elaborate. Dan Eggers : Hey, good morning, David. I would say that we continue to see a strong market backdrop for our Commercial business both on kind of the C&I side, we talk about a lot, and also the load auction side. Margins have been strong this year, particularly strong earlier in the year. Market volatility created opportunity for us as we saw some competitors pull back and get less active as you saw them put a higher price on risk capital for them to be involved in the business. So we've done a good job of maintaining, and in some areas, expanding our win rates where we've seen opportunity at quite strong margins relative to history. I would say probably in the last few months as the year has moved on, we've seen a little more pressure on margins, so well above historical norms but kind of off the highs we saw earlier this year as people start to engage a little bit more in the markets. And as I said, in the load auction side, there hasn't been a huge amount of activity, but we are seeing more participants show back up again now than we had seen in the past. Again, all margins better than history, but we're keeping a close eye on that trend as we go through the rest of this year. David Arcaro : Got it. Yeah, that's helpful color. And just the latest guidance update, does that kind of fully reflect the patterns that you're seeing so far in 4Q? If the dynamics that you experienced in 3Q continue here, are there further opportunities to kind of bolster the outlook into 2024? Dan Eggers : Yeah, as we continue to add business, I think we've taken a reasonable approach to our expectations for margins next year. As I said, we're assuming the world stays better than it has been historically, but we have embedded some moderation in margins from what we're seeing, which probably makes sense given kind of movements, and making sure that we meet our expectations for all of you. As we go through the balance of this year, the fourth quarter is an important one to watch and we'll see how much more we can add to backlog for '24 and '25. So yeah, we're hopeful we'll continue to find opportunity. David Arcaro : Okay great. Thanks so much. I appreciate the color. Joe Dominguez : Thanks, David. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Joe Dominguez : Hi, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Yeah. Hey, good morning. Good work, Emily, with your cell phone there. So just on the remaining IRA things that we're kind of watching here, the hydrogen PTC rules and then of course the nuclear PTC, could you just give us latest thoughts on timing of those? And then also maybe more color on how much we should interpret the hydrogen hub announcement as kind of hinting at where the hydrogen PTC comes out with respect to nuclear? Joe Dominguez : Steve, I'll take the last question first. We're obviously in a lot of dialogue with other stakeholders, directly with the White House quite a bit. I'm very happy with the way the conversations are going. But there's a lot of detail that needs to be in the rule and be right in the rule. So I would say I'm cautiously optimistic. I think a big part of that isn't just the hub awards, but the fact that I think they're realizing that to really jump start this hydrogen economy, we're going to need reliable time matched clean energy to get both the environmental benefits on the grid side as well as produce hydrogen in the most economic way and transition the economy. So look, I'll leave it at that. I think the conversations have been really constructive. We've spent a lot of time on that, but we've got to kind of land this thing. In terms of when it will land, I think there's an understanding within the administration that a lot of people are waiting on the hydrogen rule and they need to come out with some guidance, again not just for the hubs. But generally, we indicated in article on Bloomberg that I was interviewed in that we're slowing down on a lot of contract signings and other things pending this. And obviously, we're not alone in this ecosystem, doing the same thing. So I think they're working to kind of get this all nailed down. There's just -- there was a ton of work that needed to come out of Treasury for the IRA implementation. And so look, I don't -- I hear the rumors that they're delaying things and all that. I'm not sure I believe that. I think they're working diligently to get this thing done. I don't think the nuclear PTC piece of this is really at least, insofar as I could detect, controversial in any regard. But it also only applies to a limited handful of players like us that have nuclear assets who doesn't have the broad application of hydrogen or domestic content rules and some of the other things that have taken Treasury's time. So I think those things -- the production tax credit for nuclear is going to come in as we expected, but I wouldn't be surprised to see that come close to the end of the year or even in the first quarter. I am hopeful that we will see some guidance before the end of the year on hydrogen and that it will categorically address the use of existing nuclear to make hydrogen in the right pace. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Thanks. And then one other question just on the 24/7 clean product and the like. Just how should we think about kind of pace of adoption here and interest levels you're seeing? And this part, you probably can't really answer, which is just the type of premium that you might be getting for this type of product versus just normal power sales, yeah. Thanks. Joe Dominguez : Yeah. I think just normal power sales, volatility and everything else, we factor into the sales of the power. We've talked about historic margins of $2 to $4 and we've been clear that we're towards the top of that as this kind of market has reset itself. The sustainability offering is going to be considerably north of that because it's a new product and provides new value to the customer. Beyond that, for competitive reasons, we haven't really gone into the details of how big the margin is. And I think at the end of the day, pace is something that we're yet to fully understand in terms of adoption. We've got 180 million megawatt hours of power. So we've got a lot of this to sell. It's not all going to be deployed through CFE. There's going to be other things like hydrogen, hopefully, data centers that will take on the load. The customer piece of this is going to be a big part but policy is going to play a role as states and others think about how they want to procure carbon-free, time-matched energy. And at this point, I think we're just -- we're hitting every opportunity and pushing everything, but it's hard for me to sit here and say that we have enough data to talk about how quickly we're going to be able to deploy all of it or a significant chunk of that 180 million megawatt hours. So it\u2019s -- I would say, it's an incomplete at this point. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Great. Thank you. Joe Dominguez : Thanks, Steve. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Joe Dominguez : Good morning, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Good morning. The EBITDA obviously was raised again, but we didn't get sort of that update on free cash flow guides or incremental buyback. Dan, I guess, can you maybe just provide some sort of an update why not move on incremental buybacks? I mean, we got past the key quarter. Is there any sense on -- are you saving anything for dry powder, et cetera? Just maybe a little bit of an inkling would be great. Dan Eggers : Yeah, Shar, we've had a $1 billion program in place. We've gotten through $750 million of it. And now with [indiscernible] kind of see us spend about $250 million a quarter thus far and so we still have some money to deploy. You could imagine we'll be having conversations with the Board as far as our updated budget plan and how strong '23, '24 and the forwards look beyond that to inform kind of the next wave of capital allocation. Getting STP done was a great deployment of capital this year and kind of looks better by the day with ERCOT prices having moved as they have. Then we want to keep looking for opportunities like that and other things along that way to deploy meaningful amounts of capital if they come available. So we do want to keep dry powder, but we certainly understand that as we get this program worked down, we've got a lot of capital still around and getting it back to our owners has always been a priority. We can't find investments that exceed that double-digit unleveraged return. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then another quarter of obviously outsized marketing portfolio gains, right? I mean, can we just maybe unpack that $760 million year-over-year gain a little more? I guess, what percentage is durable margin expansion versus maybe opportunistic trading or more one-timey items like ERCOT sparks? Thanks. Dan Eggers : Yeah. I mean, I think it's probably hard to dismantle that as much as you would like to have, to be totally honest. If you think about how we run the portfolio, the Commercial business becomes responsible for managing our generation business once we get in the [Technical Difficulty] So working with the team on dispatch, how we set up positions will change. It's kind of hard to say who is a generation dollar or commercial dollar at some point in time the way you're thinking about it. But obviously, the Texas plants running as well as they did this summer with prices where they were, we have outpaced our production expectations. So there was some real contribution we got in the quarter or really in the year from ERCOT. So that's going to be a piece of it. But a piece of it is the fact that margins have been quite strong, right? I think part of that is we've seen outsized margins. We talked about the load auctions, right? And we've seen in the first half of this year what I fairly say is unprecedented margins in that business. And so that's been great. We would expect that in normal courses, those moderate in time. And we're seeing a bit of that, right? So there's some that was going to be situational to this year. On the kind of the C&I markets and the mass markets, we've seen very good margins this year that are going to sit in the book for this year and next year and carrying into '25. But as I said to David earlier, we expect some moderation in those margins as we think about what has not yet been committed or was not in our pockets at this point in time. And then the last part, I'm not going to fully get into, but we have had -- with volatility, there's been opportunities to maximize our portfolio in the physical markets. And we've done well on that front again this year to our size, probably this year and last year. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then lastly, again, for me, I know you realize you guys are still working through your capital planning before the next role. But there have been a lot of recent data points around upgrades for -- in light of like the IRA, especially for BWRs. Can you just get your updated thoughts here on sort of maybe the quantum of opportunity and potential timing there? Thanks. Joe Dominguez : Shar, I think we've basically said that we think the total universe is less than 1,000, actionable somewhere between 500 and 1,000 megawatts that make a lot of economic sense. Bryan and his team have pretty much at this point, identified every opportunity we see. We're re-costing those. I think they'll roll into the fleet by the end of this decade and some of them will drag out even a little bit longer. But we'll announce those as we complete the work and start ordering the parts for them. But we see opportunities certainly beyond that, which we've already announced. We just -- we don't have an update on that. But this is one of those where the duck looks calm on the surface, but there's a lot of paddling underneath in Bryan's organization, and we'll continue to work those opportunities. We think they're pretty good opportunities, spectacular results. Shar Pourreza : Fantastic, guys. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Joe Dominguez : Thanks, Shar. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open. Joe Dominguez : Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning to you. Thank you guys very much for the time. Appreciate it. Maybe I can go back to where some of the last questions were going and speaks to timing and holding back on hedge commitments, et cetera. I mean, to the extent to which you get a thumbs up, thumbs down or what have you on hydrogen, could we see kind of an outsized pace of commitments in the start of next year? And whether that's tied to data centers or whether that's tied to capital allocation in terms of buybacks, considering maybe the hubs do or don't move forward, et cetera? Just want to try to like piece together the different pieces here both on timing. And then also, are you effectively waiting for clarity on hydrogen in order to pursue more of these firm commitments, if you will, on [indiscernible]? Joe Dominguez : Yeah, sure, Julien. Look, I think hydrogen will occur for us in two different ways. One will be what we've called the behind the fence line, clean energy center opportunities where we'll make the guess. And what we're looking for in those circumstances when we make the gas behind the fence line of the plant, is people that will take 100% of the offtake of that gas so that we don't become somehow merchant hydrogen gas players. So certainly continuing those conversations and there are opportunities beyond LaSalle. But we'll probably focus on optimizing LaSalle and adding more megawatts there first, if we can. But I think that opportunity exists for a number of plants. The other way hydrogen will evolve is through what we've called the hydrogen -- clean hydrogen by wire, right, where we're providing a contract, very much like the Microsoft and ComEd-type contract through a customer who will then use that contract to justify their getting the tax credit for hydrogen production. And those are a lot of players kind of around the country, including many that exist in our customer base. I would say that we've added a great deal of focus in talking to those customers and seeing what the opportunities can be. I don't know yet how fast they will be able to buy electrolyzers and integrate those electrolyzers into those facilities. So I can't tell you this is a '25 or '26 type of thing in terms of actually producing the energy and producing the gas in those systems, and it could be '27. I think if the rules end up the way that we are hopeful they will end up, you'll see a flurry of contracting opportunity for us. And you'll see us begin to scale LaSalle and look at the opportunity to do behind the fence line hydrogen production at a lot of other places. We haven't stopped the discussions or the work. And in a certain sense, I would say this and data centers probably are enormous inbounds into the company right now. But both require, in the case of hydrogen, clarification from Treasury as to whether those projects will move forward. In the case of data centers, those just tend to be enormous things that require a great deal of discussion and we'll update them. I think if the rules work out the right way, I expect we'll have an exciting '24 and '25 around that. And I'm hopeful data centers will play out the same way. But it's just -- it's too early for me to describe pacing, number of megawatts, impact on the financial outcomes of the company. I'd just say that in 25 years of being in this business, these are the most exciting opportunities we have and I think they'll have great traction. But we've got to get the work done and then we'll announce it to all of you, and you'll see for yourself. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. But it's not as if you're waiting for one or the other here on, let's say, 4Q, right? Patience is a virtue as they say. And '27 is out there. And more to the point, it's not as if you're holding back on data centers or capital allocation ahead of a decision on hydrogen, just to set expectations? Joe Dominguez : No. No, that's right. I think you've described it well. And I said it in response to Steve's question. It's not like we're yet confronted with the scarcity of the clean megawatt hours that we produce. We've got 180 million of these things. So that gives us the luxury of exploring multiple channels at once. There will be a point in time where we'll be looking at kind of the financial value of one channel versus another. But I think in the early going year, we're going to be wide open and we're certainly working every angle and none are mutually exclusive at this point. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent guys. Best of luck. See you soon. Joe Dominguez : Thank you. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Joe Dominguez : Good morning. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just have one question on the asset generation. Year-to-date, it's kind of been around that 80%, 83% range that hasn't moved. Last year, I was just looking at the Q3 2022 deck for the next year that would be 2023 back in Q3 2022, you were like 90-ish percent. So this is just nuclear PTCs and sort of your willingness to stay more open next year? Maybe you can just comment on that and how should we think about hedging practice going forward into like '25 and beyond? Joe Dominguez : Let me start with that. I think the early questions we got last year, frankly, after the passage of the IRA is whether we stick with the hedging strategy that we had deployed for so many years at Exelon and in the early days at Constellation, that it's been kind of generally described as a third, a third, a third. And what we've done is we've explored all the -- we're exploring all of the options that I just talked to Julien about. But we're not tethered to any kind of fixed hedging strategy, where we're trying to get off a certain number of megawatts in a given year. We have the freedom now to explore different opportunities, to be patient, and we have been. I think over time, the percentage of the fleet that's hedged and the disclosures that we've historically used will become less relevant because we've changed the hedging strategy. And I think we'll talk a little bit more about that at the end of the year and as we update for next year and we look at these different opportunities. But at this point, the IRA effectively gives us the ability to wait and realize the $43.75 at the bus that we're entitled to under the policy. And so anything we need to do here has to be incremental to that opportunity, and that's the way we're looking at the business. That means -- that may mean we're holding on to more power or selling more power. It will depend on how these channels ultimately work. But it's the flexibility that we have now. And frankly, the value that we offer to our owners is to get the best financial results for this fleet we have. And look, I'll add -- it's already been a long answer, but I'll add to it. I just think the value of clean, reliable energy is just going to go up over time and that causes me to want to be patient. Without commenting on the technology, I see, obviously, what's happening with offshore wind. And I think all of our owners could appreciate just how difficult it is to add clean energy, let alone anything that resembles the reliability we have. So that encourages us to be patient as we walk through the transition, and the IRA gives us the policy support to be patient and get the best opportunities for us, for our customers and for the country. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. I appreciate that color, Joe. I did have one more question. You guys have talked about a different or added reporting metrics, not just EBITDA. Just any thoughts or additional color that you can share there? Dan Eggers : Yeah. We're still working through that, right? I think our plan is at the year-end update, we'll probably provide the whole host of new measures and disclosures for all of you. We've had these hedge tables, I think, we're going on something like 15 years moving out of the world of a third, a third, a third as Joe mentioned, and getting into the structure where the PTC provides a very different revenue dynamic for us. It's going to make sense to refresh everything. I also think that with the PTC being an after-tax revenue stream, I was probably talking about earnings on an after-tax basis make more sense for all of you guys. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. Thanks guys. Congrats. Joe Dominguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Joe Dominguez for closing remarks. Joe Dominguez : Well, thanks, operator, for handling the call. And I'll just end with the way I started. I want to thank our folks here at Constellation. When we -- when you separate companies, there's this kind of Harvard Business School thing that one of the values you get is that the management team has a good focus and is focused on one line of business as opposed to many, and that brings value. But kind of having lived it, the enormous value that it's brought to us is a clarity of mission not only for the management team, but for our employees, and super excited that they feel passionate about the business. The results we present are theirs. And I just want to end again by thanking them and thanking all of you for your interest in the company. We look forward to talking to you at the end of the fourth quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host of today's call, Emily Duncan, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Strategic Growth. You may begin. Emily Duncan : Thank you, Tanya. Good morning, everyone , and thank you for joining Constellation Energy Corporation's business and earnings outlook call. Leading the call today are Joe Dominguez, Constellation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Eggers, Constellation's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Constellation's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued an 8-K this morning, which includes our earnings release detailing 2023 results along with a separate press release and business outlook presentation to be covered on today's call, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Constellation's website. The materials in the 8-K and other matters which we'll discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates regarding Constellation and its subsidiaries that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's materials and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Constellation's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other circumstances and considerations that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. I'll now turn it over to Joe Dominguez, CEO of Constellation. Joseph Dominguez : Thanks, Emily. Tanya, thanks for getting us started this morning, and Emily for starting our agenda. Thank you all for joining us today. While this call is going to be focused on 2024 guidance and Constellation's future, I want to start out by commenting on the outstanding year we had in 2023, where we materially raised guidance in both the second and third quarter calls and yet still managed to exceed the top of the range in our full-year results. It's Constellation's second full year in business, and I think it's powerful that in both years, we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range, and last year, just really [indiscernible] it. We hope that these results underscore for you the importance that our entire management team places on meeting all of our commitments to you, and we're going to continue to do that. As always the secret sauce here at Constellation is a unique mixture of best-generation assets in the world and the best-in-class commercial business, all run by an outstanding team of women and men. And I want to take a moment to thank them for the wonderful results because they are the ones that deserve the credit. Turning to 2024 and the future, I'm going to kick us off by focusing on our unique business and the advantages we see coming to us in this evolving marketplace. First, I'll talk a little bit about who we are, best operator of carbon-free nuclear plants in the world, backstopped by a nuclear PTC by the federal government, and with a wide-reaching commercial business that's focused on the kinds of customers that need us the most. Second, that in the changing power markets, we provide something that I think others struggled to do and that's carbon-free energy and reliability together. We think that's going to be the bedrock of the future for the country. And third that we're best positioned to capture value in volatile markets and through the energy transition by selling the clean and reliable attributes of our 180 million megawatt-hour nuclear fleet. Now Dan is going to follow up and discuss our 2024 EPS guidance range of $7.23 to $8.03 per share, our visible 10% plus growth on the vast majority of our earnings through the end of the decade, which we call base EPS and our updated two-year free cash flow outlook. Dan also will cover some of our new disclosures and walk you through that. And I appreciate that we've already heard this morning from a number of investors who find those to be very useful. Hopefully, you all well. So let's get started on Page 5 of the materials. Constellation is a special company that supports our countries and our customers' economic growth and sustainability goals. As we've said from the very beginning when we launched this Company, the most important and valuable energy commodity in the world today is carbon-free electricity that operates predictably and reliably. And we produce more of that than anyone. Our fleet has the best track record stretching back for well over a decade as being both the most cost-effective and reliable in the world. Our scale cannot be replicated because we already own more competitive nuclear generation than all of the other US competitive nuclear generators combined. Likewise, our assets have a special longevity. The longevity of our asset-base is unparalleled and we could operate for at least another 30 to 40 years. In a conflicted political world, nuclear energy emerges as a consensus pick for both Republicans and Democrats because of its unique qualities. The reach of our customer business, serving nearly one-fourth of all of the commercial industrial demand in the US and three-fourths of the Fortune 100 puts us in the best position to use our unique assets and capabilities to meet the needs of our customers. In the same vein, the combination of our assets in commercial business give us the ability to earn enhanced earnings over and above the base earnings of the Company, just as we did the first two years of our business. We will continue to use our high investment-grade balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital allocation to create value for you, including through share buybacks because we firmly believe in the future value of this Company. And as our nuclear fleet and customer business help meet the growing demand for clean reliable energy to power the US economy, there are multiple opportunities for us to generate first base earnings growth beyond the 10% that we're laying out today, and I'll walk you through that. The world clearly is moving in our direction. In the coming years, the demand for reliable and clean energy will only grow. We're the ones that are best positioned to meet that growing demand for clean energy and to tackle the energy transition to unlock the value through compensation for the unique, clean and reliable attributes of our 180 million megawatt hours of nuclear. And to help America power the technologies of the future, whether that be EVs, electric heating, industrial electrification, or the booming demand for the data economy that America must lead in for both economic and national security reasons. The production tax credit uniquely gives us the ability to be patient so that we could capture the value in this evolving market through strategic hedging and portfolio optimization. Simply stated, because of the PTC, we can now decide whether and frankly how to hedge our fleet. We don't have to hedge a third, a third, a third. And that option, that flexibility is enormously valuable and will drive enhanced earnings for us. And we could use the cash flow from these earnings to consolidate the industry bet on ourselves through buybacks and make double-digit unlevered returns on growth investments. And so no other company has such a potent combination of predictable growth, upside exposure to power markets, strong cash flows and the downside protection from the federal government. Let's turn to Slide 6. As I mentioned a moment ago, this team is committed to delivering on the promises we make because we know that delivering on promises is the way to create long-term sustainable value for our owners. So as we celebrate Constellation's second anniversary as an independent company, Slide 6 is a summary of the promises we made to you, promises we have kept. It's a long list, but I just want to highlight a few items. As I noted earlier, we've outperformed our financial expectations. Our balance sheet remains a competitive advantage and is now BBB thanks to upgrades at both S&P and Moody's. We've accumulated growth of our dividend of 150%, exceeding our 10% annual target, we have also completed our first billion-dollar buyback, and we started a second billion-dollar buyback in January. Now for several calls, I've reiterated that we're happy to buy our shares all day long, and we still feel that way. And I'm proud to say that, that commitment to the future of value of this Company has already delivered value for you. Buying back our own shares has been one of our best investments. It's already created $400 million in value. We successfully advocated for the inclusion of the nuclear PTC in the IRA, which is a game-changer for our business. We've had a disciplined approach to M&A, adding our owner -- ownership and STP to our fleet because of our focus on dual-unit nuclear power plants and the competitive advantage they have. We made the smart decision to aggressively buy fuel and secure cost for this decade and beyond. We created an hourly matched carbon-free energy product for our customers and we're selling that product now to sustainability leaders like Microsoft. And I think it's going to position us well in this data economy. We've begun the process to extend the lives of our nuclear fleet, which brings our asset lives to 80 years. And we've maintained our status and this is the most important thing. We've maintained our status as the best operator of nuclear power plants in the world. We're very excited to have accomplished all of that and all the things that are listed on this slide in two short years, but we're even more excited about what the future brings. As I turn to Slide 7, we've talked about this before, but I wanted to spend a few moments talking about how the nuclear PTC, and how it's fundamentally changed our business now that the program is in effect. Prior to the PTC, the outlook for our nuclear fleet was dependent on power prices, lower, high and our revenues would fluctuate year-over-year, sometimes quite significantly. The PTC has changed that. At its core, the PTC ensures that our fleet will have revenue visibility starting at $43.75 per megawatt-hour in 2024. This provides our fleet with significant downside protection, ensuring its operation. But we keep the upside above the PTC floor, and the upside is unlimited. In addition, as you can see on the left-hand side of the chart, the PTC floor revenue grows with inflation and will support our earnings per share growth target. Now, we're assuming that the PTC grows at 2% in our financial disclosures, including our 10% growth rate target. However, as you can see on the right, higher inflation than 2% would have a significant positive impact on our revenue growth. So if you believe that 2% is going to be hard to hold for a decade or more, this is a company that you ought to be interested in. For example, in 2028, the difference in revenue between the 2% and 3% inflation cases is more than $750 million, and in a 3% inflation case, our EPS growth rate would be in the mid to high teens, rather than the 10% we're talking about on this call. It's really quite significant. Let me turn to Slide 8, and what we want to talk about here is the public support that's growing as well as the political support between Republicans and Democrats who recognize the importance to our energy system of baseload power -- baseload clean power from a transition and a national security standpoint. You have quotes here from both President Biden and former President Trump, both whom are proponents of nuclear energy. Prior to the PTC, states stepped up with programs to ensure that these valuable resources do not prematurely retire. Now in Illinois, some of those programs were signed by Republican governors. Other times they were signed by Democratic governors. At the federal level was federal -- it was former President Trump, and you might recall this, he was focused on the need to retain baseload energy. It was the right idea. And remember, he proposed using DOE's authority -- its emergency authority under 202(c) to support existing nuclear plants when he was in office. And it was Republicans, both in the House and the Senate, who were among the first to introduce tax credit bills for nuclear. So in a sharply divided political world where the parties don't seem to agree on much, each party recognizes the unique and critical nature of nuclear energy and how essential it is to our country. So as a consequence, we believe that the policy is durable now and into the future. Let's go to Slide 9. Slide 9 kind of shows you the many reasons why policymakers and the public have come to appreciate nuclear, and I think it really does a good job here of summing up the case for nuclear. On the upper-left-hand side, you can see that nuclear produces more energy for the same amount of installed capacity than any other energy technology. It operates more than 90% of the time. In our case, operates 95% of the time. And that's nearly three times to four times greater than wind and solar. It's also there 24 hours a day in the heat or the cold, day or night, no matter what the weather. The grid reliability and support provided by nuclear is unparalleled by any other energy resource. And I can tell you this is not theoretical. We've already seen this an event after event, whether it was the polar vortex in '14, the Elliott event, the Uri event, or numerous others. It was nuclear that carried this system on its shoulders and people know that. Now moving to the bar charts on the upper-right side of Slide 9, note the existing nuclear plants could run at least for 39 more years. And I say at least because we believe that some of our plants can actually run through 100 years, much longer than existing wind and solar operating today, and it's also longer than all the renewables that are being built right now, and we think all the renewables that will be built this decade. Go on to the chart on the lower left shows that nuclear has the lowest lifecycle emissions of any technology. This is a big thing, from a sustainability standpoint. Now, we've included here everything from construction to the mining of fuel in this calculation, and that makes nuclear the best technology from a climate perspective. And then on the lower-right-hand side of this slide, you can see that nuclear is essentially tied with solar as the safest technology, highlighting the safe operations of nuclear plants and the abundant power they produce, and their ability to do that without admitting harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. And finally, look, unlike any other technology, nuclear is the only generation resource where we know and control where every gram of fuel is and we have set aside the funds to restore the sites to greenfield condition after eventual plant retirements many decades from now. So in a nutshell, whether you're talking about sustainability, safety, reliability, waste management, or long-lived durability, nuclear offers benefits at levels that no other resource can. And that's not all. It uses a lot less land, it could be positioned almost anywhere, and it creates more family-sustaining jobs than any other generation type for us, right? We just start -- we started the Company with 13,000 employees. In the last two years, we hired 2,500 people. So and these are long-term jobs and the communities love those jobs, and of course the politicians love those jobs. Nuclear is the backbone of the energy system now and it will become even more important in the future. So as we turn to Slide 10, I want to start talking to you about the kind of changing energy fundamentals we're seeing in the market. We all know that the clean-energy transition must happen and it is happening, and Constellation's role in it will only grow. But as America transitions, there will be impacts on electric reliability and electric markets. The EIA, the Energy Information Administration forecast that installed generation has to grow. And what you can see on the chart on the left-hand side is that what we're seeing is intermittent generation replacing dispatchable generation, and it's been happening for a while. At the same time in the market, if you look at the chart on the right-hand side, you can see we're beginning to see for the first time load growth. And I'd say for the first time we've seen load growth in places like Texas, but of course post-PJM, we've kind of seen a flat line on load growth for a decade or more, but that is changing. PJM's peak demand forecast for 2028 increased by 2% just in the last year. ERCOT's forecast for 2028 increased a whopping 6.6%. That increase is being driven by economic development across the country. This past year, more than 200 manufacturing facilities have been announced, and almost $0.5 trillion investments have been made since 2021. We're seeing onshoring of businesses from Europe and other parts of the world that simply don't enjoy America's affordable energy dominance. And we're seeing onshoring of supply chains here in America due to political tensions that are rising between the US-China and other nations. We're seeing electrification of transportation, buildings and manufacturing. We are seeing increases in the frequency of extreme weather events driving peak demand growth. And the demand growth is being talked about quite frequently in the data economy where AI is driving significant increase in these forecasts. So we think the combination of the energy transition, deteriorating supply reliability as we lose dispatchable generation and rising demand is all going to put a premium on clean-energy resources that are reliable. And again, we own more of them than anybody in the world. And in short, we're seeing the signs in this marketplace for the first time in a while where we're seeing prices begin to converge on the cost of new-build. And I don't know that we know that cost just yet. When we think about the offshore wind, that has been challenged in the Mid-Atlantic and other areas, we're now seeing prices that are well above $100 megawatt hour, and that's without the kinds of storage and other things that would be required to make those things any close -- anywhere close to the reliability of the nuclear power plant. So as I turn to Slide 11, we want to kind of talk a little bit about the data economy. I know that it is something that is a focus for many of our investors. Boston Consulting Group believes that AI and regular data center demand will grow by 7% to 7% of total electricity demand by 2030. To put this in context, this is the equivalent of the electricity used for lighting in every home, business and factory across the United States. It's a huge amount of energy. Most traditional data centers that were built 10 years ago were 10 megawatts or less. Today, it's not uncommon to see 100 megawatt data centers, and with our clients, we're talking about data centers that approach a thousand megawatts. And they require 24/7 power. This is something that doesn't get talked about enough in my opinion. When we do system planning and I have done this over the course of my career, we don't just kind of willy-nilly decide what generation we want. We first look at the load profile, what's growing in the economy. So for example, if it's peaking load like air-conditioning or electric heating, as an example, as we get into the energy transition, that kind of load growth will call for a particular kind of generation, peaking gas, mid-merit gas, or in the future batteries. But if the load growth is 24/7 baseload growth, then it calls for a very different technology, and that's us. Data centers are 24/7 consumers. We are 24/7 producers. So it's kind of a perfect marriage. And then when we add on top of that our ability to provide clean energy to meet the sustainability objectives of this Company, we think that there is an opportunity for us that is quite sizable. And we think the advantage Constellation can bring quite frankly is that it could meet this demand across multiple jurisdictions, and we can frankly serve the needs of some of even the largest customers in the world. So it is certainly exciting for us and something I'm sure we'll talk about. As we turn to Slide 12, what we're going to talk about here in 12 and 13 is both seasonal and day-to-day variability. And what I want to put in your mind is the challenge of serving load when we're seeing this sort of variability, a challenge that we don't believe we face at Constellation given the profile of our generation assets. Now look, before we start this, I want to be clear. We think renewables have an important place in our efforts to decarbonize. Constellation's offsite renewable business has grown rapidly and we're on track to grow the business by 3% to 4% of the volumes that we were talking about just in 2021. So our customers very much like renewable energy, but they also are striving to get 24/7 clean-energy. And the intermittency of renewables does create some challenges for grid operators. So what you can see on this slide here is really kind of a macro-seasonal disconnect between the performance of renewables and demand growth. You can see here that demand growth, no surprise here is peaking in July and August, and we also see that a lot of renewable assets are underperforming in that period of time. When I did a lot of work in the Midwest, it was very common for a 10-year period or more that we would see capacity factors for wind in the Midwest drop to 5% or lower on the very hottest days of the year. That's like people talk about hot still dates, it happens. And so again, it's, if you have a lot of dispatchable energy, you could address this. But as dispatchable energy is retiring, this load has to be picked up by nuclear plants. It's one of the challenges we face, and it's not just a seasonal challenge. As we flip to Slide 13, you kind of see this on a day-to-day basis. Particularly in the spring and the winter, these moves could be 50% of the production, or to give you some sense of the dimensionality of this. It's the equivalent of instantaneously turning on and off five nuclear reactors without notice. And so if you step back, you could well imagine that managing this much day-to-day and seasonal variability in a system that expect certainty and reliability is going to be a big challenge, and we're seeing that. But it's also an opportunity for us because as other firms are selling into this market and they have to deal with clients that need 24/7 power, right, and clean power, like utilities, like the data economy, they have to translate the ability to find this power in the market into higher-risk premiums into their bid, right, because there's going to be scarcity in certain hours. But that's not true for Constellation because our unique blend of reliability and clean assets gives us the ability to meet customer demand in any single hour. So those higher competitive risk premiums that other folks see turn into higher margins at Constellation, and our owners benefit from better results and enhanced earnings while our customers benefit from reliable energy and sustainability. Let's take a look at Slide 14. We put an ERCOT slide in here because in many respects, we think ERCOT is an example or of where other markets are going. And so this is the powerful data point here. In 2023, ERCOT had 222 hours where demand exceeded 80,000 megawatts compared to just one hour in 2022. ERCOT also exceeded the all-time summer peak demand set in 2022 and 2021 by 11.8 gigawatts for an incredible 16%. And the system isn't just constrained at peak. I think historically we would have said, well, then there are challenges at peak. But what we're really seeing here and I think this chart does a really nice job of it is that it's not necessarily peak demand that is driving high prices. When wind and solar make up less than 26% of the total demand, the prices and taxes start to move dramatically higher and kind of asymmetrically higher, and into the thousands of dollars per megawatt hour. These high prices are signals that the market is giving to investors that there is a premium on reliability, and these prices quickly carry over into the average price of the year. For example, every hour at the maximum price of $5,000 per megawatt hour impacts the full-year price around-the-clock energy price by $0.50 per megawatt hour. So you don't have to see a ton of these hours to move energy prices and we've seen that. And we think that what's happening in ERCOT is eventually going to happen in other markets to different degrees. And frankly, ERCOT has some advantages in that the solar and wind profiles there are among the very best in the entire nation. So the somatic is this reliability is equally as important as sustainability, and we have to solve for both. And that's why we say the most valuable energy commodity in the world today is a commodity that does both of those things, and that's what Constellation owns. Nuclear sustainability attributes were ridiculously undervalued for so many years, and it's now beginning to be recognized. But it's only the beginning and we're still a long way off, as I mentioned before, but fully understanding or valuing what clean and reliable energy together means. We think that spells a very good future for Constellation to exceed what we're talking about this morning. As I turn to Slide 15, our states were the first to recognize how vital nuclear was in supporting the economy and the environment. New York, Illinois, New Jersey, Connecticut, they had controversial programs, I would say, and the ZEC programs for nuclear initially. But they all look pretty prescient now, don't they? And what we're seeing is that customers are following their lead, showing a more willingness to contract for the attributes of our fleet. And we have quite a few ways to monetize getting paid for these attributes and we're going to be able to sell those more and more as the state programs roll off. And as we progress through the decades, you can see on the chart on the left-hand side, we're going to have a full 180 million megawatt hours of clean nuclear power to sell annually. That is leveraged at exactly the right time these transitions and energy market and the economy are occurring. And so, as I talked about it earlier, we see opportunities in the data center area for 24/7 clean generation because of the sustainable needs, because they need energy 24/7, and our dual unit sites are competing for behind-the-fence line opportunities with those technologies. Depending on the outcome of the treasury -- final treasury rules and if we don't get the right outcome, depending on the outcome of litigation, hydrogen remains an opportunity for us going forward. We are committed to the view that we are correct in the interpretation of the statue and we'll win. The states and the federal government are now entering into the marketplace to look for hourly match carbon-free energy. We've seen that in the case of ComEd, and we continue to see opportunity with our customer -- C&I customers who want to follow the lead that Microsoft and ComEd have set for an hourly match clean-energy product. Now importantly, when we talk about the 10% growth for base earnings through the decade, these opportunities aren't included in either our forecast or our expected growth rate. Now, it's a little bit early to share what we think the value of the attributes would be and I think this is the kind of thing that gets needs to get updated as contracts get signed. But if you just look at the chart on the upper-right-hand side, you can kind of see the impact. If we sold attributes for half of our fleet at $10 per megawatt hour, and I am not signaling that $10 the right price, isn't, but that alone would be $900 million of additional revenue. And since there is no additional cost test to generate the revenues, the upside would be more than $2 of additional earnings per share. So you can kind of see how both inflation and the sale of attributes meaningfully change the 10% growth rate and make sizable leaves to upwards of 20% or more. And remember, while we pursue the opportunities from the market through attributes sales, our revenues are protected by the PTC. On Slide 16, I want to bring back a couple of the points I've already made. We're the largest generator of nuclear power in the country, all of which sets in competitive markets. And you can see from the chart on the left-hand slide here that if you accumulated all of the other merchant or competitive nuclear in the market, it still doesn't total what Constellation is. But more than that, our fleet is overwhelmingly dual unit. So if you think about the 25 units we're invested in, all but Clinton and Ginna are dual unit sites that enjoy those economics. And that's important both from the cost of producing the megawatt hour but also behind-the-fence line opportunities with data centers and others. We're the cleanest generator with the most attributes to sell in the market. And because we could operating in competitive markets, we have the opportunity to create value unlike any regulated peer. And we're the best operator of plants and we've led the industry and you can see this on the right-hand side, and we produce more energy by something like 4% of capacity factor than the industry average. That doesn't sound like a lot, but operating 4% better than the industry average is the equivalent of having another reactor's worth of power, or for you, $335 million in additional revenues with costs only higher for the fuel consumed. If I turn to Slide 17, I want to talk a little bit about what we're seeing in the competitive C&I market and how these businesses kind of fit together very well from our perspective. The story here isn't just about sheer size. You can see on the upper chart here that we're the second-largest retail supplier. It's the composition of the customers that we have. We've been focused from the beginning on the C&I customer base. Again, when you think about our generation profile, providing 24/7 power, we want to have the kinds of customers that have a load profile and demand profile that works best with our machines, and that is commercial and industrial customers. Secondly, these are the kinds of customers that have sustainability goals. So as we introduce products like 24/7, and as we continue to rollout core with its sizable growth which is our off-site renewable program, it's become a real win-win for Constellation and its customers. And we could serve that load with lower risk than others, meeting the margin expansion that we foresee will go into our earnings. Now Slide 18 talks about how we're uniquely positioned to help our C&I customers meet their demand. And frankly, like our country, customers are on a journey here to meet environmental and sustainability goals and to do that in a way that is most affordable. And we've positioned the business to be a great partner to these customers. We anticipated the drive for clean energy so we created the Emissions Free Energy Certificates, the EFECs that now effectively memorialize nuclear generation. We've worked with PJM and other RTOs to have the data available to the market so that customers could see the hourly match because we know that this is moving towards hourly match and already has. Customers wanted energy tied to specific projects. So we created our core off-site renewables program, and we work with renewable developers to match their projects with our customers. And as I've said several times here, we're leading the way with the first truly hourly match carbon-free program in the market. Customers now get to see a particular asset that produces their clean energy where we need it. And the big thing here, folks, I think the change has been the acceptance of nuclear as a sustainability solution, been around for a long time. And years ago, we couldn't get customers to look at nuclear, regardless of its economics, it's reliability or its environmental benefits. But that's changed. States led the way and customers increasingly accept nuclear and that opens the door for us to have a sales discussion. And once customers see what we could do from an affordability and time match perspective, they like it. And our customers are exploring behind-the-meter opportunities and we're looking at different partnerships as that landscape evolves. As we move from just energy to more sustainability products. The other thing we're looking at is the duration of the contracts tends to expand. And so we see margins significantly above historic margins and the duration of term that is significantly longer. And that adds to visibility of our earnings for the decade and beyond. Our customer relationships and the focus on C&I will put us on the path to monetize the assets that we have, we uniquely have and the reliable and clean energy. So I'll close this part of the presentation with Slide 19. The success in the outperformance of the past few years would not have happened had we not had this unique world-class generation portfolio with the best commercial team in the business. And we've integrated those two things as one part of the platform. Over the past two years, our commercial business has demonstrated that it could thrive in volatile and changing markets. And I think that's what we're going to see going forward. I think all of the data indicates volatility and change both from growing demand and the turnover and the composition of the fleet is going to lead the volatility and our team is well positioned to handle that because of the stability of our assets. So we're going to be able to price in higher margins to customers to manage their exposure through these volatile moments. We're going to be able to optimize our individual generation and load positions to create the best position using both understanding that we control fully now when we hedge, we're going to be able to sell customized sustainability solutions. And these businesses will work in tandem to serve our customers, help America transition and provide the carbon-free and reliable energy that we need. And I think it's going to produce results that are better than our current plan. So now I'll turn it over to Dan to talk a little bit about the financial outlook and some of the changes that we've made. And again, very much appreciate the positive comments we already received. Dan? Daniel Eggers : Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. We're very proud of what we've accomplished since we launched, and we're even more excited about what lies ahead. I'm starting on Slide 21. As Joe outlined, the nuclear PTC has fundamentally changed our business by providing revenue visibility, supporting earnings growth through its built-in inflation adjustment and protected against power market downside by providing a floor or base level of earnings while maintaining exposure to higher prices. From a mechanical perspective, the PTC will be treated as an after-tax revenue stream that will fill the gap between spot revenues at each plant. What we consider the after-tax earnings support our high investment-grade credit ratings and our strong free cash flow generation to support reinvestment or return of capital to our owners. We are transitioning our primary financial metric to operating EPS. Our guidance range for 2024 is $7.23 to $8.03 per share up considerably from the $6.28 earned in 2023, which I'll remind you as well ahead of our original expectations for last year. On Page 31 of the appendix, we provide 2023 EPS by quarter to help you calibrate against last year. And since EPS is new, the easy rule of thumb is every $4 million of pre-tax equals $0.01 of EPS and ties back to some of Joe's slides earlier. More than just helping to prompt the change to EPS, the nuclear PTC is reshaping how we approach the sale of electricity from our nuclear plants. Historically, we hedge on a three-year ratable basis to provide earnings visibility support our credit metrics and ensure that we have the cash needed to run the business with the downside revenue protection from the Nuclear PTC and current interpretation of gross receipts. We no longer need to hedge our generation output in the same way, allowing us to better take advantage the power price moves. This also means the traditional way of modeling the company is changing. To help, we are also introducing new disclosures also provide simplicity, a longer time horizon and greater visibility into our business that you've all been asking for. Turning to Slide 22. Our total earnings can be thought of in two parts. First, we have a significant portion of our business, which delivers consistent, visible and easy to calculate earnings that will grow over time. This goes beyond the support the PTC provides our nuclear fleet and includes our commercial business and non-nuclear assets. We call these base earnings, and they can be easily modeled using simple PxQ. For example, retail margins times volumes sold and the nuclear PTC price times generation output. Base earnings for 2024 of $5.45 to $5.55 per share, which we are confident will grow at least 10% through the decade. I'll discuss the tools for calculating base earnings in a moment. To get to our total EPS, we have a second bucket that we call enhanced earnings. Our company consistently makes more money than what is captured and the easy to calculate base earnings, but these earnings don't comport to the same PxQ math and can also vary year-to-year depending on market opportunities. Our extraordinary results last year, a good example of outsized value capture, created by market volatility that provided an opportunity for greater margins. When we look forward, you can think about enhanced earnings is including stronger-than-average retail margins, realized power prices above the PTC floor and capture value from volatility driven by the factors Joe talked about. We feel comfortable that enhanced EPS will add at least 10% to 20% to total EPS on top of base earnings, but we're doing better than that in 2024 and 2025 due to the big backlog gains and forward power prices in those years. This breakdown in the base and enhanced earnings are modeling tools, which will help provide visibility into our disclosures and greater clarity into our business. We plan to refresh the split on base and enhanced once a year when we provide new guidance on the fourth quarter earnings call. During the year and for our quarterly results, we only report total EPS. Turning to Slide 23. Through the end of the decade, our base EPS will grow at a compound rate of at least 10%. And we see opportunity to do better since this outlook assumes a 2% inflation rate for the PTC adjustment, does not include getting paid for our clean and reliable attributes through data centers or additional CFE sales that Joe talked about or margin expansion from our customer business that we have seen in recent years to name a few potential drivers. All of those items would be additive to our growth rate. I do want to be clear that the growth rate will not be a straight line. It will vary from year-to-year due to a variety of factors, including the lumpiness of the PTC floor adjustments as well as the number and duration of outages in any year. You can see this most clearly when looking at 2026. At 2% inflation, the PTC does not increase that year. And it is a heavy outage year where we also expect longer-than-normal outages because we'll start installing our turbines for the upgrades of Byron and Braidwood. Over the long term, we are confident that we will grow base EPS by at least 10%, and we've included all the tools you need to be able to model and validate our outlook. Moving on to Slide 25. You can see the types of simple tools that can be used to calculate base earnings. The model inputs, including costs can be found on Pages 32 to 34 in the appendix and will help you model out to 2028. For our generation fleet, we provide expected generation times price. For nuclear, this is broken down by the CMC units in Illinois, New York units inclusive of the ZEC revenues and the remaining PTC units. On the nonnuclear side, we provide capacity prices and volumes, historical renewable PPA prices and minimum expected spark spreads. On the commercial side, we provide 13-year average historical and forecasted margins for both our power and gas businesses, which captures the vast majority of the base earnings for our commercial business. We have other businesses like Constellation Home, energy efficiency and portfolio management that year in and year out consistently contribute to our earnings. These tools will help to easily model Constellation well into the future giving you much longer visibility in the base earnings. Moving to the next slide. We know that we'll earn more each year than our base earnings, and you can see that with our outperformance in the last two years. As I mentioned earlier, these earnings are not as easy to model from a PxQ approach, it can vary year-to-year as we take advantage of market opportunities. That said, we are confident that we'll continue to drive additional value from our competitively advantaged businesses. For 2024 and 2025, commercial margins will be above the 13-year average used in base EPS, which we've already put into backlog through forward sales made in '22 and '23. For example, in 2024, we are seeing electric margins $1.75 per megawatt hour more than the 13-year average as we've monetized recent commodity price volatility and as customers have wanted the certainty that a fixed price product offers them. Enhanced earnings are also benefiting from plants where forward power prices are above the PTC floor as well as optimizing positions between our retail and generation businesses. When we look into the future and the assumptions underpinning base EPS, we expect enhanced earnings to add at least 10% to 20% to total EPS in typical years, but see that contribution higher for the next couple of years given the extraordinary commercial margins we've locked in. On Page 35 in the appendix, we provide some inputs around enhanced gross margin, this should help add dimension to this earnings stream. I'll now turn to our capital allocation plan on Page 26, which should look familiar to all of you. Our goal is to deliver value for our owners through the capital allocation plan on our philosophy on how to do so is unchanged. Our high investment-grade credit ratings are our foundation. Our strength has been recognized by both S&P tto our recent upgrade of BBB+ and by being placed on positive outlook at Moody's. Our high investment-grade credit ratings and strong credit metrics reflect the high-quality nature of our business. We remain committed to the dividend, we'll grow our dividend per share by 25% this year, starting with the March 2024 dividend, bringing our total dividend increase since we started in 2022 to 150%. We'll continue to target 10% annual growth in future years. We will continue to invest in our assets, which will supply the grid with clean energy from our nuclear fleet for decades to come and help decarbonize the American economy. Our 2024 and 2025 capital plans can be found on Page 36 of the appendix. On growth, we will continue to be disciplined on both organic and inorganic opportunities making investments where we exceed our double-digit unlevered return threshold. Last year, we were thrilled by a large part of the South Texas Project nuclear plant. We'll continue to look for acquisitions to meet our business priorities and return thresholds. Over the next two years, we'll also invest in organic projects that will grow and continue the operations of our invaluable carbon-free assets. We're making investments at some of our plants to get them ready for future behind the meter demand and hydrogen remains an opportunity for us, but is immediately dependent on the outcome of the final rules of treasury. In addition, we happily invested alongside our owners last year, completing our first $1 billion share repurchase program. Our Board authorized the next $1 billion program in December, we've already been buying this quarter. We're excited about the opportunities to invest in our business the right returns, but we're also more than happy to keep buying our own stock. Turning to Slide 27. Let's talk about our free cash flow outlook for the next two years covering 2024 and 2025. Starting on the left, we forecast approximately $6 billion in free cash flow before growth after accounting for base CapEx and nuclear fuel, which is still a lot of money to deploy. As I mentioned on the last slide, we have nearly $900 million in organic investments over the next two years with returns that exceed our double-digit threshold. $900 million will be returned to our owners and common dividends, reflecting this year's 25% increase and then the projected 10% future growth. We then plan to return another $1 billion to owners to the share repurchase authorized in December and have already completed $150 million of that authorization. That leaves us with approximately $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion of unallocated capital over the next two years. This unallocated capital provides us the flexibility to pursue our strategic priorities including M&A and additional organic growth as long as those projects meet our return thresholds. And as you've seen us do, if those opportunities do not materialize, we will return the capital to our owners. Thank you all for your time today. We're incredibly excited about the opportunities ahead of Constellation and our great growth story. We look forward to another strong year in 2024 and delivering on our financial commitments. I'll now turn the call back to Joe. Joseph Dominguez : Thanks, Dan. Folks, I'm going to close here basically where I started. We've had a fantastic run for the first couple of years of this business. But as we look at the fundamentals of power markets, as we look at growing demand, need for sustainability solutions, we think there is a ton of room to run yet. And we think we have a very durable policy in the PTC because of the kind of unique position we're in, where both political parties have strongly supported nuclear energy for all of the reasons that we covered earlier in the presentation. At our core, we have visible base earnings growth of 10% through the decade, backstop by the PTC. And again, our assets are the best in the world, run by the best people that operate those sorts of plants in the world. And this company can't be replaced. There's simply not enough nuclear out there to replace it. And we all know from having seen Vogtle, what the cost of new nuclear is. And notably having 25 of these assets and having to just replace two of them at Vogtle was $35 billion should give you some sort of insight in the replacement value of clean energy that is also 100% dependable throughout any sort of weather event. Our businesses -- our commercial and our generation business are a great marriage. That 24% share of the C&I business gives us the ability to connect our unique capabilities with some of the most sustainable companies in the country, and that just seems to be growing. As we look at the dynamics of energy markets, it's impossible not to conclude that if we're going to continue on the energy transition, that reliability is going to become just as important as sustainability, and we're able to do both of those things. We just think that we're a huge part of the solution for America. And our clean reliable nuclear plants, coupled with our ability to reach customers and help them achieve their sustainability goals supports our vision as being the leading company in this space. On top of the opportunities that we've talked about, we're going to have 180 million megawatt hours of carbon-free electricity that we could receive additional compensation for through 24/7 sales, behind-the-meter opportunities, hydrogen subject to the final rules or the outcome of litigation, government procurements of clean energy, and just simply capturing prices above the PTC price floor as volatility continues and accelerates in the markets. All of these opportunities are all on top of what is a wonderful profile for the Company of growing a very base and predictable part of our business that comprises a huge chunk of our earnings by 10% per year. And Dan and I have already discussed how that number could be considerably better. So that's the reason, as we talk about capital allocation, that that we're happy to buy the shares of this company all day long. Because the road we've traveled for the first two years is nothing compared to the future that we're going to have as a company here at Constellation. With that, I look forward to answering your questions with the rest of the management team here. Operator : Certainly [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe. Your line is open, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Yes. Hey, good morning. Can you hear me okay? Joseph Dominguez : Steve, we could hear you. Great. Good morning to you. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Great. Thanks. So I guess, first for Joe, just as you're thinking about the attribute values the fleet and the different options, whether it's the 24/7 or the on-site hydrogen, on-site data center, et cetera, just how are those kind of weighing against each other right now in terms of most likely? And then just also kind of the timing of when you're likely to kind of be in a position to start making more of those decisions. And just to clarify, those are all kind of upside to base and enhance the way to think about it? Thank you. Joseph Dominguez : I think so, Steve. I think it will represent itself both as an improvement in base and enhance because when you think about how the PTC pricing elbow works, right, wherever -- assuming your overall price is below that elbow, there's extrinsic value above the elbow. It's effectively the possibility that prices will be higher than the elbow come the time of the delivery year. So whenever you're getting -- whenever you have a contract value that's in that range, if you're adding to it, for example, PJM capacity payments, if those end up being higher, even if the plant right now is residing in the PTC level, the closer it gets to that elbow, the higher the value of the extrinsic floor, and that gives you enhanced earnings. It also gives you what Dan has talked about the potential for higher margins and better portfolio opportunities as you handle the contracts. But effectively, what we're thinking is the contracts will be well above the PTC levels, right, to reflect the value of the attributes. In terms of how we're seeing the opportunities, let me just go from kind of maybe worse the best. I think hydrogen right now, we've stayed in the game on the hydrogen hub in Illinois because DOE has asked us to, and they're covering the cost, pending the outcome of the final rules. If we don't get the right final rule, we'll head into litigation, but we'll suspend further capital deployment or opportunities in hydrogen until we get an outcome from the courts. In terms of 24/7, we're continuing to see uptake from our customers on those opportunities. They are some of the same customers that appear to us in the data economy world, right? So Microsoft shows up as the first pioneering 24/7 customer. It's also a potential customer empowering the data economy and growth in that economy. And so I think of those two things as kind of similar. There will be customers that obviously, are pursuing sustainability solutions that aren't in the data center economy like ComEd and others. But I think probably materially the biggest piece of this, at least as we see it right now, is going to be in the data economy and selling 24/7 solutions to those companies that are in the data center business or intending to grow in the data center business and trying to do that across multiple jurisdictions so that we could get a template agreement in one place where we could agree on pricing and then quickly move to other opportunities with that same customer in other parts. I think when you think about who we are, the spread of our assets, we're probably the only company that can do this at scale, that has the megawatts available, and do it with geographic diversity that these clients seem to like. In terms of timing, Steve, we're working on all of these issues. There's a huge team at Constellation that is involved in these discussions and sorting them out. They're big deals so -- and they take a long time to materialize. And what I don't want to get into in these calls is predicting when the outcome of those deal discussions will occur. But they want speed to the market and we want speed in terms of getting this started. So I think the incentives are aligned. Daniel Eggers : Hey, Steve, just to tie that into the earnings expectations, right? As we sign long-term contracts for the attribute sales of data center, what have you, those long-term earnings contributions would flow into the base earnings given the long-term visibility that go with them. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Thanks. One other question just on the -- when you kind of came out with this base growth rate, how are you, what are you assuming for kind of use of free cash in that plan? Daniel Eggers : Yeah, Steve. We use a range of expectations, right? We have the billion-dollar buyback on right now. We've got the $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion of unallocated. We assume that we'll use some of that for growth opportunities and some of that for buyback. But I would say that, that outcome covers a range of outcomes. So it's not as if it was an all-buyback assumption, which would probably be the highest additive contribution to EPS, right, because you get immediate contribution, whereas the growth investments probably have a higher return, but take a little more time to get into play. So we -- our growth rate is -- encompasses a wide range of capital deployments to make sure we'll meet our commitments. Steve Fleishman : Okay, great. Thank you. Congrats. Daniel Eggers : Thanks, Steve. Operator : And one moment for our next question. Our next question will be coming from David Arcaro Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Joseph Dominguez : Good morning, David. David Arcaro : Hey, good morning. Morning. Thanks for the comprehensive update here. Let's see. I was wondering on the free cash flow outlook or really solid outlook here for 2024-2025. As earnings grows, will free cash flow before growth to be growing at a similar level over time? Or just wondering if there are other important puts and takes over the guidance period for cash flow? Daniel Eggers : Yeah, I think that's a fair expectation. If you think about setting aside the nuclear PTC and the tax attributes of it, we will work through our tax credits we've accumulated previously. So depending on capital investment and bonus depreciation, things like that, our functional cash tax rate is probably going to be a bit higher in the future than it has been in the past. That could be a little bit of an impediment. Year-to-year, you can see different timing on nuclear fuel spend or base CapEx spend, particularly if we think about the work we're doing to extend the useful lives of the assets. But I think it's fair to assume that we should have some good follow-through on free cash flow. Joseph Dominguez : And David I just quick to supplement Dan's point. I think that the opportunities we're talking about don't come necessarily with more O&M. Some of the behind-the-meter opportunities might, but that will be factored into the contract pricing. But simply selling attributes doesn't add a bit of O&M to our Company. So its cash conversion is quite large. David Arcaro : Yeah, got it. Thanks. That makes sense. And then let's see, you give a range -- you know that range of $10 to $20 per megawatt hour for the attribute payments. Is that the right range that you think about for each of those different clean attribute potential, whether it's hydrogen, whether it's data centers? And I guess, what's your confidence in achieving that uplift in terms of the pricing level for those end customer sources? Daniel Eggers : Yeah. David, I think, we put those in as kind of just benchmarks for you to kind of quickly do the math. We're not selling an attribute for $10 here. That's just not what we would be interested in over the long term. What we're -- you know, what doesn't make sense to do on this call is kind of reveal our pricing curve for attributes because that's obviously, competitively sensitive information. But we put the $10 in as just an illustration. It could have just as easily been $20 rate. David Arcaro : Okay, great. Got it. I'll leave it there. Thanks so much. Operator : And one moment for our next question. And our next question will be coming from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI. Durgesh, your line is open. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to follow up, a quick clarification. Dan, the unallocated capital, the $3 billion, is that factored into the base EPS growth rate, or is that in the other bucket on top? Daniel Eggers : Yeah. I mean, I think you should think about it as some deployment of capital for buybacks and then whether it was used for paying down debt, although we'll manage our balance sheet differently, or reinvestment in projects which we have contractual visibility, which is really how we think about our growth investments by and large. I think you should assume a decent amount of that would show up in base, right, because your denominator is changing on a share buyback calculation. It would also help enhance a little bit, to be totally honest, if your share count is falling. But we used a range of different allocations to get comfortable with both the growth rate and the range we provided. We didn't want to lock ourselves into one version of future capital deployment. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe any color that you can share on your M&A strategy going forward? Obviously, there's a healthy bit of free cash flow here for you to execute on, but just -- and you layered out the return parameters, but what kind of assets? Is it predominantly nuclear, or could you be looking at other renewable assets? If you could just provide more color there. Thank you. Joseph Dominguez : Yeah. Look, I think we talked about the two parts of our business, the commercial business and the nuclear asset base. I think it's fair to say that M&A activity would be focused on both of those things. And in the case of nuclear, we've kind of long said that young dual unit sites are our type around here. So those -- that's sort of -- anything that's in that -- fits that description will be something we'll be interested in. Durgesh Chopra : Perfect. Thanks. Daniel Eggers : And Durgesh if I just add, if you think about -- sorry, I would say, if you think about last year, we were successful on STP would certainly fit that template. Other assets where we were not successful because it didn't fit our return profile or our asset mix. Joseph Dominguez : But look, it's all at the right price, right? What you're seeing here in terms of the management presentation is that we like the future of this company. We like the future contracting opportunity. We like the future realization of the reliability benefit that we think we can. So stated quite simply, we think there's a lot of value that is still unrealized here. So as we look at different M&A opportunities, it's going to be judged against buyback in the sense of where is going to be the greatest impact or a return for our investors. And I'm not sure where that's going to be. We have a type of plant that we would be interested in buying. We have commercial businesses that we'd be interested in buying, but those things have to come at the right price. And if we've, I think, demonstrated anything very well over the first couple of years is we're going to be really disciplined in how we look at that. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Thank you so much for giving me time and appreciate all the disclosures in the appendix. That's really helpful. Thanks again. Operator : And one moment for our next question. Our next question will be coming from Angie Storozynski of Seaport. Angie, your line is open. Joseph Dominguez : Good morning, Angie. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. Good morning. So just maybe two things. One is, can you tell us how you did against the free cash flow projections from the analyst day from '22? Again, whenever I think about power, it should be a cash business, right? So I'm just wondering how you tracked against that guidance range, and also, what was the main reason why you decided to change from EV to EBITDA -- well, from EBITDA to EPS? I understand the nuclear PTCs, but just like conceptually, what was the reason? Daniel Eggers : Angie, it's Dan. On the free cash flow performance, we exceeded our commitments in both years, I think that's how I describe it. We can get you the actual numbers, we follow up, but we did exceed the numbers on the plant for both years. As far as going from EBITDA to EPS, I think a major factor was the nuclear PTC because you're calculating its gross receipts. The PTC value can move within the calendar year. It is an after-tax number so how you affect your net income would be consistent as those two balance themselves out. From an EBITDA perspective, it added a lot of volatility, and there is not an ability to gross up the PTC to a pre-tax EBITDA equivalent value on the consult of -- our outside council and then auditors and all those folks. I think the other part, more significantly, right, is that when we look at our story, right, we're a strong investment-grade company with a modestly levered business. We've got a really compelling growth story as we see it with the PTC growth and the opportunity to redeploy capital. The free cash flow, as return it to our owners or reinvest in the business drives a unitized growth story which we all felt fit a lot closer to an EPS-driven business and a more mature business than probably what we would have experienced with the volatility and variability of results that a lot of the IPPs have had over time, where they didn't have the certainty provided by the PTC in our core commercial business. So we thought it was a really natural time to make the transition and probably suits us to compare to companies who we think we look a lot more like as we go forward as a company. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And just one other thing. So when I look at your -- the progression, for example, of O&M expenses and CapEx, right, those numbers seem to be going actually even faster up versus EBITDA projections. So -- I mean, that would imply like -- well, at least the CapEx one would imply lower free cash flow generation of the EBITDA that you're adding. And admittedly, and again, there's no question about it, you guys have been on the forefront of addressing the nuclear fuel cost risk. I mean, I obviously, appreciate all of the additional purchases, nuclear fuel expense, nuclear fuel CapEx, et cetera. But just again, is there a shift in how cash-heavy the cash -- the earnings are? Or is it just -- again, I don't know if you can comment at all. Daniel Eggers : Yeah. I mean, Angie, I think on the O&M front, right, I mean, you got to remember that we did buy STP last year, right? So there's a fairly meaningful step up in our projected O&M for '24 from last year's update because STP is in, and that's the biggest piece of the increase in '24. We also, just like we saw in '23, we do have a higher O&M for performance-based compensation for employees given the extraordinary results we've had in commercial. As you're aware, we locked a lot of backlog in '22 and '23 that's going to show up in '24, hence the strong enhanced earnings numbers. We pay at delivery, not at inception, right? So our O&M is going to be up with extraordinarily higher profits for that pace. I think we're really comfortable with the O&M profile relative to earnings expectations. And if you look at how much the numbers have moved for '24 from over a year ago, I think that's pretty clearly validated. On the CapEx front, I think timing will vary from year to year depending on what our workload is for maintenance capital at the plants. When we've done things like the up rates, we've moved some capital forward in order to get that on and get those high-return projects in place. So I think we look at a long-term CapEx program that's incredibly consistent, where we expected things to be maybe a few more dollars here and there for long-term support of the assets going to the SLRs. But we feel good on that front. On nuclear fuel, we were, you're correct, well ahead of where the world was heading on the need to procure fuel. We had bought out through '28, that has continued beyond '28. We have contracts extending well out into the 30s at this point in time across the fuel chain. So I think that we've managed our fuel exposure very well. We talked about last year, '28 nuclear fuel expense to be around $6 a megawatt hour. It might be a smidge over that, but not a whole lot more. So I think we've done a good job controlling where our fuel costs are, certainly in an inflationary environment. And I guess the last point is on fuels because people ask about it a lot because you can see the spot price move around. I'll just remind you that we don't buy in the spot market, right? We buy in the term market for all of our products. We are a long-term buyer with a very sophisticated fuels group. So where we're procuring is certainly different than what you're seeing on a very illiquid tape. Angie Storozynski : And none of your fuel contracts have any indexation to the current price. Joseph Dominguez : We -- some of them will have collars around them, and I will tell you that in all the numbers we're showing, you basically have those contracts at max caller value. Angie Storozynski : Sounds good. Thank you. Joseph Dominguez : Thank you, Angie. Operator : And one moment for our next question. Our next question will be coming from Neil Kalton of Wells Fargo. Neil, your line is open. Neil Kalton : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question on the retail power margins. You're showing in 2024, about $1.75 above the 13-year average is trending down to $0.50 in 2025. Just curious, is that -- does that reflect the market coming in '25? Is that just where the hedges sit? Just any kind of comment on how we should be thinking about '25 and beyond there? Daniel Eggers : Yeah, Neil, I think when you look at our commercial business, right, we tend to sell forward in contract terms, let's call it, 24 months plus or minus, right? We would have sold a lot more of our '24 volumes in '22 and '23 than we would have sold '25 volumes in '22 and '23. So what we have in our numbers reflects really the positive backlog gains, right? We had very good margins on what we've been signing to the point that margin sustain at the higher than these long-term average margins you would expect that enhanced value to improve as we sell more contracts, right? So anything that isn't sold at this point in time, we assume reverts back to this long-term average we've seen volatility continue. We've seen good margins hold up into this year. So I'd say there's probably, in my mind, a bit of opportunity if we can sustain at these market conditions. And the commercial business has just done a tremendous job taking advantage of the market, but also helping our customers, the volatility is disruptive to them. So our ability to sign and provide them long-term certainty to their energy costs is really valuable for them, and it's been a good relationship for sure. Joseph Dominguez : Neil, I think, it could be pointed out that we're probably a little conservative here in returning back to historical margins as opposed to resetting margins. But there's probably a flavor of conservatism throughout the materials as Dan has covered, and that's just we anticipated you would or you or someone else would raise this question, we just used the historicals for a plug for right now until we see how the market continues to evolve. Neil Kalton : That's what I thought. I just wanted to make sure that was the case. And then in terms of the growth there, how should we think about it? I think it's like 200 terawatt hours is sort of your base. I mean how do you think internally about the growth longer term there? meaningful? Or should we think about it as kind of being in that range for the foreseeable future? Joseph Dominguez : Well, I think that gets into the question of operates. We've already announced some. We have others that we're looking at. We're looking at some other fairly material opportunities to increase the number of megawatts that we produce and then anything that would happen from an M&A perspective. We're not going to build more nuclear, so that's -- it's really how we optimize the existing fleet, which is already running at a pretty high capacity factor. We'll look at upgrades M&A opportunities and possibly some unique opportunities that we have to bring megawatts on. So that's -- I think this is a neighborhood we're going to be in for a while. Daniel Eggers : Neil, on the retail side of the house, I think that we have been opportunistic in our ability to grow. We've been a consolidator in retail for a long period of time. So I think when things that fit our portfolio, could be added to our volumes. I think the team always challenge themselves on the profitability of the customers and the margin gains that we're looking at, right? So we're going to balance all those pieces as we go forward making sure that it's not just volume driven, but it's profit to be organization-driven. Neil Kalton : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Operator : That ends our Q&A session today. I would now like to turn the call to Joe. Joseph Dominguez : Well, again, it's been a longer-than-usual call. We had a lot to go through in terms of the evolving marketplace, Constellation strategy and the change in guidance that we're providing. Appreciate, again, all the positive feedback. We look forward to continuing to deliver on the promises that we made to you. So looking forward to the first quarter call. And with that, I'll end it and thank you again for your time and attention. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Constellation Energy Corporation First Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Emily Duncan, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Strategic Growth. You may begin. Emily Duncan : Thank you, [ Towana ]. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Constellation Energy Corporation's first quarter earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Joe Dominguez, Constellation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Eggers, Constellation's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Constellation's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.  We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Constellation's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we will discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates regarding Constellation and its subsidiaries that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Constellation's other SEC filings for discussions of the risk factors and other circumstances and considerations that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations.  Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. I'll now turn the call over to Joe Dominguez, CEO of Constellation. Joseph Dominguez : [ Towana ] thanks for getting us started this morning. And Emily, thanks for running through all that and laying out the agenda for today. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We had an excellent first quarter operationally and financially. We're making steady progress with technology customers on transactions that will power America into the future and employ thousands. And last week, we concluded meetings with our Board where they authorized another $1 billion in stock buybacks because we believe in our strategy.  This is the second buyback announcement in less than 6 months. Dan and I will cover all of those topics and more this morning, but I want to begin today with a celebration of Chris Crane, the former CEO of Exelon, who passed suddenly last month. We appreciate all of you who reached out and shared your thoughts and fun memories of Chris. If there ever was one, Chris was a nuked through and through. And as much as anyone, Chris deserves credit for the operational excellence of our fleet and improvements in other fleets around the industry. He was an operational genius. His reach was far and he touched so many people. He and I spoke regularly after Constellation launched. He's happy to see how we are doing but his first thoughts were always about our people. He was always so proud of folks here at Constellation, especially the women and men at the plants. They were his family. Many of us here worked with Chris for over 20 years, but you only have to be with him for about 20 minutes to know what he cared about. Safety and operational excellence was always number one, followed closely by the care and the development of the women and men who we are all privileged to lead every day. Those two things were his North Star. He was a leader for the industry and had conviction and courage through a lot of hard times. He was an all-of-the-above energy thinker. He cared about nuclear because he was sure that you could not run a full time clean energy economy just on part-time power.  We've got a lot going for us here at Constellation, and we'll talk about that today, but one of the most important things we have is Chris Crane in our DNA. He trained and mentored Bryan Hanson and David Rhoades and a lot of our other leaders. We're going to miss him, but you can be sure that his legacy of excellence will carry on here.  In February, we gave you a very thorough update on the company and the opportunities that lie ahead of us to create value for you, our owners. So we don't have to go through all of that again in detail, but I do want to reiterate a few points. Constellation will grow base earnings by at least 10% through the decade. And importantly, we have a number of opportunities to generate base earnings above those levels. In the coming years, the demand for clean, reliable megawatts will only grow, and we think we're best positioned to meet growing demand for clean energy to tackle the challenge of the energy transition; to unlock value through compensation for the uniquely clean and reliable attributes of our 180 million-megawatt hour fleet; and to help America power the technologies of the future whether that be EVs, electric heating and industrialization where we've got a lot to go or in the booming demand for artificial intelligence technologies and other digital infrastructure projects.  I'd like to drill down on that last point for a moment. Over the last few months, a lot has been written about power demands in the technology industry. But I want to assure you that these challenges will be overcome as they have in the past because we all know here how imperative it is for America's national security and economic competitiveness that the U.S. leads the world in the development of these technologies. And we're working hard every day to make that possible.  The data economy and constellations nuclear energy go together like peanut butter and jelly. And as such, we're in advanced conversations with multiple clients, large well-known companies that you all know about powering their needs. Speed to execution is important to them as it is to us, but these are large and complicated transactions that require diligence and time to finalize. And while we're not done yet, I do expect that we will finalize agreements that will have long-term and transformational value. They'll ensure that our fleet and the jobs and economic community benefits that we already provide will be sustainable for decades to come. As demand grows, our nation's need for firm clean power grows proportionately. As we add new clean power, the role and importance of nuclear will only grow. We intend that Constellation will be a leader and adding new clean, reliable megawatts to the grid to meet the needs of American families and businesses. We're going to do that in three ways : First, we're extending the lives of our existing sites to power the nation into 2060 and beyond, creating more clean energy than all of the renewables ever built in this country.  We've already received or have announced license extensions at 5 and have more to come, assuming supportive policy. Continuing to run these plants through license extensions is quite simply the most important thing we can do for America's clean energy future. Second, we're adding megawatts by using uprates to increase the output of our current machines. And we already announced to you operates at Byron and Braidwood that will bring in 160 megawatts in the next few years. And we're looking at many opportunities to do that other plants. We believe that the opportunities will add up to 1,000 megawatts or perhaps more of clean, firm power to the grid. This is in addition to the many hundreds of megawatts of renewables that Constellation is adding through CORe+ deals with customers and through our wind repowerings.  Third, we're looking to partner with others to locate new technologies, including new nuclear at our existing sites. These sites already have, of course, community support and existing infrastructure for nuclear energy. And we think our simple thesis is this, if new nuclear is going to be built anywhere where we do business, it's going to be built on sites where there already is existing nuclear because that's where communities love the technology and have the capability to support more. So we believe that we're uniquely suited to provide this value and grow the industry.  Turning to the quarter. We delivered first quarter GAAP earnings of $2.78 per share, and adjusted operating earnings of $1.82 per share driven by continued strong performance from the commercial business through better than historical customer margins and through optimizing our combined generation and customer business. Given the performance, we're confident in our full year outlook, and we look forward to another strong financial year. Our performance and creditworthiness is being recognized. Moody's upgraded our credit rating to Baa1, which is further recognition of our strong financial footing, and we issued the first green bond to fund nuclear power in the United States. I think that's really cool, think about it 5 years, the idea of using green bonds for nuclear would have been something that people would have scratched their head at, it happened. And you could see the enthusiasm in our near- and long-term outlook for our business through our continued share repurchases, buying 500 million shares to date with another 350 million of that coming since our end of the year February call.  Looking at our strong free cash flows and near-term allocation opportunities, the Board, as I mentioned, previously authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchases, bringing our remaining authority -- authorized buyback capacity to $1.5 billion. As Dan will explain, even after this new authorization, Constellation has ample cash available for growth investments, acquisitions and returning even more value to you, our owners.  Turning to Slide 6. The importance of nuclear energy to our economy, electric system and meeting the country's environmental and clean energy goals was first recognized by states when they enacted zero-emission credit programs, and it's now been followed by the federal government through the nuclear production tax credit. Since then, the financial community has embraced nuclear energy understanding its importance to our country's success.  As I mentioned, we issued the first nuclear green bond in the U.S. There was significant demand for this product, and we were able to upsize our offering as a result. The strong demand from investors for our 30-year green bond is recognition that clean, reliable nuclear energy is critical to meeting the sustainability goals of the nation and will be beyond the present period of our current licensed lives. I mentioned that we received a credit upgrade from Moody's. Importantly, included as part of that upgrade, Moody's improved our carbon transition score to its highest level, a further recognition of the importance of nuclear energy to the energy transition.  More and more customers are acknowledging that nuclear should be part of meeting their own clean energy goals. Our customers are signing deals for hourly match carbon-free power from our existing plants, and we are talking to others about behind-the-meter opportunities at our sites. Congress has passed legislation to provide the necessary funding for bringing more of the nuclear fuel chain into our country, ultimately reducing geopolitical risks and supply. We expect DOE to issue a request for proposals imminently. And states across the country are taking action in favor of nuclear energy.  State legislatures have 130 bills out there to support nuclear energy this year compared to 5 to 10 historically. States like Michigan and Minnesota have passed laws moving renewable standards to clean energy standards, which include nuclear. I was pleased to see that Governor Shapiro in Pennsylvania recently did the same thing. They're removing barriers to nuclear by repealing moratoriums on building new nuclear and they're developing regulations to support new development in the states. In places like Indiana and South Dakota, where there currently is no nuclear, there are plans to build nuclear. And 6 states, Red and Blue have created incentives in their state budgets to attract nuclear to their state. The momentum behind nuclear energy, both existing and new, continues to build as more and more policy makers recognize exactly what Chris Crane believed that you can't power a full-time economy on clean energy that is only part time.  Turning to Slide 7. Nuclear performance was strong and ahead of plan for the quarter. We produced more than 41 million megawatt hours (sic)[ 41 million Terawatt hours ] of reliable available in carbon-free generation from our nuclear plants with an on-plan capacity factor of 93.3%. We completed 3 refueling outages during the quarter, with each lasting less than 22 days on average, and overall faster than we had planned. During our outage at Quad Cities, we anticipated a longer outage due to inspections on the low-pressure turbines that were installed as part of an upgrade in 2010.  But even with the additional work, we were able to complete that outage in 20 days, full 8 days faster than planned, kudos to nuclear and the entire team there. Our renewables and natural gas fleet also performed well with 96.3% renewable energy capture and 97.9% power dispatch match. The team is now completing our summer readiness work so that we're ready to go when the temperature turns up. Turning to Slide 8. Our commercial team is off to another great start. We continue to see strong margins in our customer business. We talked about this in the last call, our projections being based partly on historical margins. We're continuing to see strong margins as we get into the beginning here of 2024. They're also creating value because of our integrated generation and customer business, capturing value through optimizing our positions across the fleet. I talked a moment ago about customers choosing existing nuclear to meet their energy demands and we continue to meet our customers' need for hourly match clean energy. We recently signed 2 deals with 2 of our largest customers that I just want to briefly mention. In each case, we converted these customers from a renewable-only product to a product that now uses nuclear energy to fill in the gaps when renewables don't operate. Each will ensure that our customers have full-time power, clean power each and every hour that they are consuming it. The first is with Comcast. It's a new deal that includes offtake from new solar facility. The second, which will be announced in the coming weeks, converts an existing CORe deal, which again is Constellation's off-site renewables program to now include hourly matched carbon-free energy with energy from our nuclear plants. So our customers are recognizing that in order to meet their goals and make the difference for their business, they need full-time clean power to run their full-time businesses. So now with that, I'll turn it over to Dan for the financial update. Dan? Daniel Eggers : Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 9, we earned $2.78 per share in GAAP earnings and $1.82 per share in adjusted operating earnings, which is $1.04 per share higher than last year. As Joe mentioned, our commercial business has continued to perform very well. They do this through our generation to load portfolio optimization strategy, and we take advantage of our physical position in the markets to capture more value to the combined generation and customer businesses than they could if they were apart.  On the margin front, we are seeing margins come in better than planned and continue to trend higher than our long-term averages that we use in forecasting, as we discussed with you all on the last call. In addition, we had more nuclear output year-over-year and saw lower costs for our refueling outages in the quarter. And as a reminder, this was the first full quarter with contribution from our ownership share in the South Texas project. And speaking of first, this is the first quarter the nuclear production tax credit was in effect, favorably contributing to our earnings even after sharing some of the value of the PTC with our states. And as a reminder, we forecast the full year PTC value for our business based on the expected gross receipts at each plant.  So as prices realized through the year different from where we started the year, the value of the PTC can change relative to forecast, but the overall net earnings for Constellation should be the same as the mix of energy revenues and PTCs will balance to get us to the same place. Finally, our soft performance year-to-date has resulted in higher compensation expense year-over-year due to the timing of how we book compensation expense, it results in higher O&M during the quarter, and it will for the full year as well. We remain very comfortable with our earnings guidance range of $7.23 to $8.03 per share.  Turning to the financing and liquidity update on Slide 10. I'm excited to expand upon some of the accomplishments that Joe mentioned in his opening remarks. As he said, firm clean megawatts are the most valuable commodity in the market today, and we own more nuclear generation in competitive power markets than all of our peers combined. We look at the opportunities ahead of us, continue to view our stock is compelling at the current share price, even after the strong performance we have already enjoyed this year. In March, we entered into a $350 million accelerated share repurchase agreement, bringing our total repurchases to $500 million year-to-date. We have now executed $1.5 billion of share repurchases since the first quarter of 2023, buying back approximately 13.5 million shares in total. Having completed $0.5 billion authorization from December, we're happy to announce that our Board authorized an incremental $1 billion, bringing the total program to $3 billion. We will remain opportunistic with the remaining $1.5 billion authorization and still see our stock is attractive. Our high investment-grade credit ratings are a core principle to our capital allocation strategy. Our ratings are further strengthened by Moody's upgrade to Baa1 in March bringing it in line with S&P's BBB+ rating. The ratings action taken by Moody's recognizes the strong financial performance of the company and the stability provided by the nuclear PTC.  Last, we issued the nation's first ever corporate green bond including nuclear with proceeds of $900 million. The funds from the 30-year issuance will be used to finance green projects such as nuclear uprates to increase the production of clean, carbon-free energy. We saw a significant demand despite pricing amid a busy window for corporate supply allowing us to upsize from our initial target to $900 million, but still within our full year issuance plan. We also achieved very tight pricing when we look at both spreads and treasuries in line with 30-year holding company debt for regulated utilities. This is the second 30-year offering we have done in between the two, we have had $10 billion in demand, demonstrating the strong investor confidence in us as a company and a belief that our assets will be a critical part of the U.S. energy mix for a long time to come.  Turning to Slide 11 and our 2-year view of free cash generation and planned use of the cash. We'll update this slide and we make meaningful updates to our allocation plans like the increased share repurchase authorization we announced today, or the STP transaction last year. As you can see from the chart, even after the increase in share buyback authorization, we still have approximately $2.3 billion of unallocated capital in 2024 and 2025, providing considerable strategic flexibility for us to further benefit our owners. I'll now turn the call back to Joe for his closing remarks. Joseph Dominguez : Thanks, Dan. Constellations like no other company. We have a unique set of existing assets that create opportunities that no one else has. At our core, we have visible base earnings growth of 10% through the decade that is backstopped by the federal government through the nuclear PTC and has a built-in inflation adjustor. We're the largest and best operator of nuclear power plants in the United States. Our plants are especially well positioned to meet the challenge of reliability and clean that U.S. electricity markets need.  Our more than 20% share of competitive C&I connects us to leaders in sustainability and the drivers of power demand, in particular, demand for sustainability products. Our country needs what we have, clean and dependable power generation to drive economic growth, support our national security and our environmental goals. Power demand is growing, and at the same time, reliability is becoming a premium product, and there is no more reliable power source than nuclear.  Increased demand, combined with the change of the electric system to be more dependent on intermittent, non-dispatchable resources means that we're going to see continued volatility and increased volatility for years to come. This presents an opportunity for us to drive additional value for our owners. In short, we think Constellation is a big part of the solution to America's energy supply. Our clean, reliable nuclear plants, coupled with our ability to offer customers what they need will support the energy transition and our national security. And that's why Republicans and Democrats recognize that nuclear is the backbone of the electric system today and will be tomorrow, and that support continues to grow.  On top of the opportunities we have from continued volatile power markets, and we've certainly seen movement in power markets. We have more than 180 million-megawatt hours of carbon-free electricity that we produce annually that can receive additional compensation through 24/7 clean attributes behind the meter opportunities, government procurements for clean energy and capturing prices above the PTC floor levels as we see increases in power prices as demand continues to ramp. These opportunities are on top of the 10% growth we have in our plan. Our task is to capture the additional opportunities as they unfold and to do better than our plan for our owners.  With that, let me open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro : I appreciate the update. Joe, you mentioned that you're exploring the potential to locate next-generation nuclear units at your sites. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that, just maybe what technology you're looking at. Where does that stand overall? Joseph Dominguez : Yes. So David, here's what we've done so far on that. There was an RFI that was issued by 3 companies : Google, Microsoft and Nucor Steel. And what these companies were looking for is power today, but also some role in building new clean power supply in the future. And so what we outlined in our response to that request for information is exactly what I said earlier on the call that we think our existing sites are in an incredibly valuable resource as we consider new firm, clean energy, in particular, from nuclear energy. And so we proposed a structure kind of a multi-tiered structure where we could begin flowing power today from our existing power plants on a long-term PPA. As part of that long-term PPA, we would work with our customer to begin to evaluate opportunities to add new firm energy. Now big part of that is subsequent license renewal of plants in our fleet, then upgrades and other opportunities that we have organically to add additional megawatts in our fleet. And then finally, to investigate different technologies for SMRs and actually other technologies as well that can be cited at our locations. And what we would anticipate doing over time is having some work with the customer to select that technology. And then the customer, through increases in the PPA, would begin to fund site development work construction ultimately scaling up to the point where the PPA absorbs the full cost of an operating new unit. And so we would anticipate operating the unit for the owner because obviously, it would be on our site, and we would have a slice of equity given our contribution in land and other things of value to the owners. So this is in the beginning stages, but what I could tell you is it's of great interest to a number of clients in this space that not only want to have immediate access to power today, but want to have more clean power in the future. And so that's how we're walking through it. In terms of the technologies we're looking at, I think folks know generally that we have a small equity position in Rolls-Royce. So that would be a technology that we would look at, but we would also look at other competing SMR technologies. And we've worked with the owner to figure out which technology best meets their future need at the cost that's appropriate. So that's the work in that area. But again, look, I want to emphasize that the most important thing right now that customers could do in this space is make sure the existing fleet we have right now is ready and funded for subsequent license renewal. These contracts allow for that, and that's an important sustainability objective for our customers, then operates and other opportunities. And finally, new incremental clean generation which I think could be brought online somewhere closer to the middle of the next decade. David Arcaro : Perfect. Yes, that's really helpful color. Very interesting. We'll stay tuned on how that opportunity develops. And then I was wondering, as you're thinking about or talking to hyperscalers, big data center developers, are you seeing any discussions or opportunities evolve related to something like a supercomputer, a major multi-gigawatt data center like the Stargate idea we'd seen in the media, something that could potentially use power from multiple nuclear plants. Is that an option that you're seeing being explored at this point? Joseph Dominguez : I think we're just going to be careful here in terms of that because there's just a lot being reported about that in the press, and we don't want to be kind of linked to a particular project until it's time to announce something. But I think what I am comfortable saying is this, David, we're seeing interest in developing projects that are on a size and scale that presently don't exist, but will be needed for training systems and other things to kind of build out and support the need for all of these foundational models. I think they're up to 170 plus now foundational models that are going to require training data centers. These are things could be aerodynamics or pharmaceuticals, but essentially, these very, very large computers that would do nothing more than train for a period of time on all of the learnings in every country, in every language from the beginning of time until now be positioned to answer the questions to the future to advance these different industries. So we're seeing significant increases in the number of those training modules that customers need. It's our understanding that in order to support the training, we're going to need data centers that are of size and mentioned from a megawatt standpoint, that is far beyond what currently exists out there in the market. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : Maybe starting off on the disclosures. I mean, obviously, Dan, we've seen some major moves in the curves in recent weeks. You guys didn't really update the ranges on the enhanced gross margin for '24 and '25. Obviously realize you guys gave wide ranges, but I mean where are you relative to those curves, these curves? Daniel Eggers : Yes, we gave a huge amount of disclosure as you captured on the last call. Our approach to updating those is really going to be when we do a more comprehensive revisit of our guidance, right? What goes into enhance is more than just a power price, there's a lot going on in the commercial business and other positioning. So I think when you see us assuming we update our earnings guidance or our range as the year goes on, I think that's a good opportunity to refresh the disclosures we have, including our expectations for enhanced in '24 and '25. I think when you look at the curves, and Jim can share more thoughts on this, right, but there's been a lot of movement, depending on what day you pick. There's the price has been -- a lot of different prices, the near end of the curve, particularly in our markets has been probably more muted right at the back end where you're seeing a lot of the news largely. So I don't know that within the range you laid out that there's a lot of movement to what we shared with you for '24, '25 at this point in time. And Jim, do you want to talk about markets? James McHugh : I think you hit it. I think that if you look out at more the '27, '28, '29 time frame, the market run-up we saw during the first quarter has kind of held on and maybe gone a little higher. The '25, '26 time frame has been a little bit more volatile in both directions, and that volatility is which Joe spoke to, right? When we see the continued baseload retirements and renewable penetration with energy demand, we're going to see volatility up and down. The out-year strength, I think, is certainly reflective of some of this increased demand that we're talking about, it's not real liquid out there. There's not a lot of trading volumes that can be done out in that time frame. And as Dan mentioned, in our last call we provided, the attribute value side. I think that's a good proxy for how price movements, whether it's energy prices or attributes or whatever could be picked up in some of our enhanced earnings. So there's some data, I think, from the last call that you can pick up there. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay. It's perfect. So I guess, for '26, '27, '28, whatever, are you still within that 10% to 20% of consolidated range as a general rule of thumb? Daniel Eggers : I think we use that as a rule of thumb, and I don't want to mark to market. But Shah, if you go back to the slide we had on attribute value in '28, you had $10, which is like the curve might have moved depending on market in that range. You can see those numbers get bigger and inevitably push you out of that 10% to 20% if you're just going to mark that one variable right now. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. And then, Joe, lastly... Joseph Dominguez : It's Joe. I just want to reiterate the point that I think Jim and Dan are making. There's definitely -- we're certainly seeing upside if you were to freeze this moment in time in terms of the power prices later in the decade, but they're not all that liquid right now. So we'll see how it kind of evolves over time. And the right point for you to look at us is when we talk about guidance ranges, again, as we get through the year, we'll provide some more data points on that stuff. But I think it's exciting to see all of that it also is in a liquid market out there. Shahriar Pourreza : Yes. No, I appreciate you addressing that because I mean, that's one of the key questions coming in to us is why didn't you mark like some of your other peers. So I appreciate the color there, Joe. And then just lastly for me, there's been a bunch of industry chatter on this. Are you considering a TMI restart at this time? If so, can you maybe talk a little bit about the capital involved in that and the time line? Joseph Dominguez : Shah, what we'll say is that we've obviously seen what happened with Palisades. I think that was brilliant, brilliant for the nation saw great support out of Michigan, great support out of the federal government. And we're not unaware of that, that opportunity exists for us. So we'll -- we're doing a good bit of thinking about a number of different opportunities, and that would probably be certainly one of those that we would think about. But we're not there yet to start disclosing capital and other things relating to that opportunity. A lot of exciting things for us to do in uprate space as well. And I think you could kind of -- if these things fall into place, you could kind of see where Constellation might be the nation's leader in adding firm, clean energy to the grid. And so these things are huge, chunky things that really position America for the future. So we're going to stick with that until we have something more specific to report. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : I'm a little more of a peanut butter and chocolate Reese's fan, but I like the peanut butter and jelly reference. The -- just on the data center opportunity, maybe you could just give us a little more color because there's a lot of utilities talking about data center growth and even some of the companies talking about data centers related to gas plants. So just first on just -- first on the demand that you're seeing, but then maybe more importantly, any sense of kind of timing and just other things to execute beyond just customer demand? Like are there hurdles you need to get through on permitting, citing other things that set timing gap? Joseph Dominguez : Yes, Steve, I think the interest is like nothing else we've seen in 20 years in terms of the number of clients that are coming to us, the size and scale of the opportunity. So I would say that kind of the -- what you're hearing in the market is certainly accurate in terms of the inbound that we're getting from an origination team perspective and frankly, some of the outreach we're doing. So that's all seems to be right. Right now, it's focused on nuclear because the clients we're dealing with aren't interested as a general rule in emitting technologies. They have sustainability goals. They have 24/7 clean goals, and they want to stay on that path. So we're focused right now on the nuclear plant opportunity and monetizing the value of the attributes that we have. But these are, as I mentioned earlier, very complicated. What's apparent to me is that our prospective customers in this space are all in a hot competition, one against another to grow this kind of capability, and there's a clear view out there that those companies that move most quickly will be the companies that get a durable advantage in this space. So they're incented to move very quickly. And we are too. We want to get this business going and to show the results to our owners. But with that said, Steve, there is complexity to these transactions. These are transactions that are longer in duration than any of the power contracts that we're used to talking about in this business and involve notional values that are quite a bit higher. So there's work that needs to be done diligence that needs to be done. In terms of things that are connected in front of the meter and if we're going to talk about PJM, for example, there's a load integration process that people have to get through in order to site a data center on the grid. And this is a network integration service study that could take months at best and years at worst. So a number of these customers are looking at co-location opportunities to hasten the speed in which they could become operational. So if you're looking behind the fence line of the plan or a co-located opportunity, there's a necessary study process. It's another PJM process and PJM was clear in its amendments to its documents most recently that you could go either on the grid or behind the fence line, but there's a different process. We have become quite good at using the tools that PJM uses in their necessary study work so that we could look across our fleet at places where we think we could add the load behind the fence line. We went through a necessary study process at LaSalle. And as it so happens, we were doing that in the case of the hydrogen hub that was intended to be built out there. So we did a study for 900 megawatts and we were able to match up very closely our ability to model PJM's work and be able to simulate that here at Constellation. So I would say that we know very well where we could co-locate data centers and get through the PJM process, but that's a necessary study process that could take anywhere from 6 months to a year to resume. And once you have that, it goes through, I don't want to say perfunctory, but a fairly routine FERC approval process. And that would be the starting point. So if you have a necessary study done, what you're really talking about is having the transformers and the infrastructure, but you could kind of break ground pretty quickly. You don't have a necessary study done. You're going to have to wait for a year to figure out where you could co-locate. And then on the data company side, they also have the time that they need to build out the shell, the infrastructure, supporting all of the equipment inside cooling and likewise, and then actually build out the servers inside of it. So you have to anticipate a ramp rate. So from my perspective, this isn't something you're going to see people plop into service in '24, '25 [ towns ] ahead of others because they started earlier. But this is more stuff that begins in '26, '27, '28 and it ramps over time as the data centers are built. No one is plopping down a 1 gigawatt data -- and I've read reports of this. No one is plopping down a 1-gigawatt data center in 6 months to believe that completely and thoroughly misunderstands the amount of work needed to get this stuff done. So the contracts have a scaling component to them. You saw kind of an example of that in the town, the Susquehanna deal that was done. That's similar to ramp rates that you would see in other things. And that's why I'm pretty confident we'll be able to manage the energy demands on the system because you likewise will ramp into this load. So that's what I'm seeing here. A couple of years before you're able to really start delivering the megawatts and then it ramps steadily after that. What we're trying to do is get the contracts done that lay out the gross amount of megawatts that are going to be needed, the time frame over which they're going to be needed and allows us to begin necessary infrastructure work with an understanding that we're doing the PJM study and other things on a parallel path even as we speak here this morning. Steven Fleishman : Okay. Is it -- do you think you'll be able to have something to announce by the end of the year? Joseph Dominguez : Look, I'll stick with this. We are working fast. Our clients want to work fast. For competitive reasons, I don't want to lay out when we think announcements are going to come, and I don't think it would be fair to our clients to do that either at this point. There's work that is underway. We've got a lot of folks thinking about it and working on it, again, as this call is progressing. So I'm confident that we are going to be able to get to the finish line on these things, but we still have some work to do. And I don't want to lay out a time frame for announcement. Steven Fleishman : Okay. Just one other quick question. The law that passed on the Russia limits on nuclear enriched -- nuclear and then investing in U.S. enrichment. Can you just talk about your nuclear fuel -- update on your nuclear fuel positioning and the impact of that law? Joseph Dominguez : Yes, Steve, I think on this one, there's not a whole lot more to report. In effect, we -- when we took the actions we took a couple of years -- over a year ago now. We were anticipating the passage of the band as we reported at the time. It took a little bit longer to get through Congress, but it's now there. It's now realized. So I think it just simply supports the strategy that we put in place a year ago. We think we are in a very solid position, kind of industry-leading solid position with regard to fuel. And we also are happy to see now investments in this domestic supply chain, which means that after this period of time where we've grown inventory, we're confident that we're going to have available and recently priced fuel to run this fleet for the next decade. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : Maybe just -- you obviously authorized additional $1 billion in share buybacks. I know there is no direct answer to this, but can you just help us kind of think through what is your calculus when you're thinking about incremental investment opportunities versus deploying capital on share buybacks and considering M&A in the future? Joseph Dominguez : Yes. I don't mind talking about it at all. It really is a summation of everything we've talked about in the call. We think we have a very good strategy here. We think as we compare that to M&A opportunities, the unrealized value in Constellation seems to be the best place for us to put our investment dollar right now. It has -- we have been buying shares of this company since we were, what, in the $80 and we saw a little bit of a drop in prices. We had some kind of negative, I would say, analyst reports at that point in time. We didn't believe it. We told you we didn't believe it. We told you we'd buy the company all day long. We still feel that way today because what we're looking at is the potential growth in our business, the opportunities that we know we're working on, the fundamentals and power markets and sustainability goals that I talked about earlier. I think that unrealized value is the best thing out there to go buy into. And so when we have extra cash, we're going to buy into that, and that's precisely what we're doing. The only thing that will like better than that is making ourselves bigger and better. So these uprate opportunities or other things where we could add megawatts of scale give us a great positioning and are actually supportive of the work we're doing with the data companies. So that's where I think you're going to see our deployment and capital. We'll continue to look at reinvesting in ourselves and investing in these organic opportunities. Presently, I don't see an M&A opportunity on the horizon is at a scale that is going to enter into this conversation because I don't think those opportunities provide equivalent value to our owners is investing in ourselves for the growth -- organic growth opportunities that we have here. Durgesh Chopra : That's very clear, Joe. I appreciate all that color. And then can I just switch gears and quickly a follow-up in regards to the nuclear PTC guidance, what is the key -- what are the key items for us to look there? Is it the definition of gross receipts and just how do you see that playing out? Anything you can share there? Joseph Dominguez : Well, I wish I could. We're waiting for treasury guidance as we've probably said this on [ forward ] calls. But it is not as near as we could tell a high priority item for treasury because it has a narrow application out there. It's really just nuclear owners that are looking for. We think spot is most likely going to be the thing that prevails. So the spot price over the year at the bus of the plant, that's going to be energy and capacity coupled together, are going to be the measuring stick that the treasury will use for the application of the PTC. That's kind of consistent with the vast majority of the comments in this area. That's certainly, we think that's where they're going. But we just don't know yet because they haven't announced anything, and we're waiting on that. But our planning is based on that spot interpretation as we've outlined previously. Operator : At this time, I would now like to turn the call back over to Joe for closing remarks. Joseph Dominguez : Well, again, [ Towana ] thank you for kicking us off this morning. Thanks to all of you. We very much appreciate your interest in Constellation. I want to thank our women and men for a fantastic quarter. We look for more to come as the year goes forward. You know we're working on a lot of different things here at the company. The wind is at our backs, we feel very confident about the future and the fact that our best days are ahead. So look forward to catching up with you again on next quarterly earnings call. With that, I'll close the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Emily Duncan, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Strategic Growth. You may begin. Emily Duncan : Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Constellation Energy Corporation's second quarter earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Joe Dominguez, Constellation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Eggers, Constellation's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Constellation's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Constellation's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we will discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates regarding Constellation and its subsidiaries that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Constellation's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other circumstances and considerations that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Joe Dominguez. Joseph Dominguez : Thanks, Emily. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning and thanks for your interest in Constellation. During this incredibly hot summer, we've had, our best-in-class nuclear fleet has once again met the challenge and is delivering clean, reliable 24/7 power. Combined with our renewable and natural gas fleet, we're providing the power to keep families cool and businesses running, supporting our country's economic growth. Our commercial business continues to do an awesome job, providing needed products to our customers and managing our one-of-a-kind portfolio. I want to thank the women and men at Constellation for their tireless efforts and for helping our customers meet their energy and sustainability goals. At Constellation, we put our people first because they're the ones that are responsible for our success and because we think a good culture creates good results. In fact, I think it's the single most important driver of any company's success. Look, we're far from perfect but we work hard to make this place, some place where people want to come and spend a career doing important things for America and thriving. That is why we're so proud to report to you that Constellation was certified as a great place to work once again. We've been out as a separate company for about two full years, a little bit over that. And for two years, we've received this honor. And it's particularly impactful to us because you only get this certification through surveys and high marks by your people, independent surveys. So it's great to see that our folks are seeing the work we're doing. They believe in our mission, they're passionate and they're 100% committed. And it shows up again here in results for you, our owners. In this quarter, we're able to provide excellent results, but also raise guidance in just the second quarter. We delivered second quarter GAAP earnings of $2.58 per share and adjusted operating earnings of $1.68 per share. We are raising our adjusted operating earnings guidance from the initial range of $7.23 to $8.03 per share to a revised range of $7.60 to $8.40 per share. In effect, we're resetting the midpoint of our guidance to what used to be the top end of our guidance range. The fact that we do that here in Q2 as opposed to waiting until Q3 when these updates typically are provided should tell you how strongly we feel the business is performing. It's even more remarkable when one considers the compensation headwinds associated with stock comp, where the stock has obviously performed very well over the first half. Dan will cover all of the financial details in his slides. In terms of buybacks, we bought $500 million worth of our share during the quarter, bringing the total cash deployed on buybacks so far this year to over $1 billion -- or excuse me, to $1 billion. Although we've seen some slippage of late, we remain bullish on buybacks because our thesis is incredibly unique and compelling. We will grow base earnings by at least 10% through the decade, backstopped by the federal PTC, and that growth does not reflect the opportunities we have in front of us from adding new clean, reliable megawatts to the grid to meet reliability needs or from selling to data center customers. And as we have been throughout the year, we remain quite confident in our ability to do better each year than our base earnings, delivering even more value to our owners. And finally, we released our third sustainability report, highlighting our efforts to help customers achieve their goals. I encourage you to read it. It outlines the good work we're doing on so many fronts as we lead the nation in the production of clean and reliable energy and provide unique and powerful sustainability products. Now before I turn to the operational updates, I do want to spend a few minutes on two topics that are garnering a lot of attention. The PJM capacity market auction results and the data center opportunities and the FERC proceeding concerning those opportunities. First, let me talk about the PJM capacity option. We think and PJM said this in its press release, we think the same thing. It's telling us what we already know. The demand for electricity is growing and supply and demand fundamentals are tightening. We foreshadowed all of this in our lengthy 2023 Q4 call, when we walked through the market fundamentals in considerable detail. Fortunately, the reforms FERC recently approved for the PJM capacity market are designed to incentivize the supply that we need, namely incentivizing supply that can be counted on to operate when our customers need power. PJM proposed and FERC approved a design that provides greater compensation of the power plants like ours that historically deliver when the system needs power. We previously have shown you data on how nuclear energy performs extraordinarily well through grid emergencies, while other resources, frankly, do not, whether they are intermittent or dispatchable fossil assets. That means that nuclear is best positioned in this new market design and appropriately receives a fair level of compensation. In light of the forecasted load growth in PJM, we expect to see higher sustained pricing for capacity to address reliability needs and send more accurate price signals to retain, operate and relicense our plants as well as incentivizing the development of new resources and customer demand response. Over the years, the PJM market has a proven track record of attracting investment through price signals and has developed over 60 gigawatts of generation to meet all of the needs of the grid. And we're confident that the market will respond to higher prices and add more resources as needed. With that said, we know that higher prices impact families and businesses. And so our commercial team is working with these customers to provide solutions that manage the risk and smooth out bumps. But I think it's important to remember that adjusted inflammation, PJM energy and capacity prices are less today than they were 15 years ago. Markets work folks. What has changed for the customer is that the distribution and transmission elements of the bill have gone up. They've gone up to address reliability needs on those grid systems. But thankfully, that has been largely accomplished. And now we need to focus on investments on the reliability of the supply side. And that's what the capacity market is designed to do. Over the last two investor calls, we've emphasized that reliability is as critical as sustainability. They have to go hand-in-hand. Constellation's business is based on the thesis that the most valuable energy commodity in the world today is a reliable and zero emission megawatt of electricity. To us, the PJM results are just another data point that Constellation's thesis is right and that we're focused on doing the right things. First, by providing sustainability products to customers that expressly lead reliability to sustainability by time matching clean energy production to when our customers use energy. And second, by investments in relicensing and upgrading the clean energy centers that will reliably and sustainably power American families and businesses for decades to come. On this second point, in its recent comments concerning the auction, PJM alluded to potential efforts to speed up the interconnection of needed resources. We look forward to seeing PJM's ideas, and we certainly will support those efforts in any way that we can. The case for prompt and decisive action by PJM is manifestly clear. In sum, we need to invest to grow America's economy, and we need to invest and enable the technologies that support our economies and protect our nation. We think Constellation will play a big part in these efforts. That's our mission, and it is what inspires our people to make Constellation a great place to work. Now turning to Slide 6. We're continuing to do well in our discussions and negotiations with data center companies. The simple fact is that data centers are coming and they're essential to America's national security and economic competitiveness. We've heard this from a variety of policy bankers, a number of nations including China are buying for AI supremacy. And it's absolutely critical that the U.S. not fall behind it. Time is of the essence. We simply cannot wait years for the data centers that are going to bring transformations. They're going to bring transformations in medicines, bringing new cures to diseases and treatments that research alone cannot do. They'll better predict weather. They'll provide material enhancements and they'll do things for us on the energy supply system to more smartly manage the grid. Economically, data center investment means considerable construction as well as permanent jobs, tax revenue, community development and other benefits to our states. We appreciate what the utilities in our states are doing to attract this crucial economic engine. We're doing our part, too. All of our political leaders understand this and that's why states are competing with each other, Republicans and Democrats alike, to bring the development of data centers to their jurisdictions. All of the policymakers we talk to want data center development wherever it occurs on the grid or co-located. But as you're all closely following, there's an active conversation underway by policymakers and stakeholders, trying to understand the implications of the different ways of power and data centers. We welcome that conversation, and we're confident that any thorough examination of colocation with nuclear plants will show that it is both the fastest and most cost-effective way to develop critical digital infrastructure without burdening other customers with expensive upgrades. As we see it, utility connection will continue to make sense for some applications and in some parts of the grid. But where it's an option, we will continue to see customer interest in colocation, strong interest because there are just too many advantages of connecting large load directly to large forms of generation, especially clean generation. And I don't think that point is really debated. On Slide 6, you can see some of the many quotes from key stakeholders including the utilities that oppose Talen ISA talking about the significant benefits of colocation. I'll outline four of them. First, and behind-the-meter, configuration the data center customer, not other customers, pays for the infrastructure needed to connect to the power plant. Unlike in front of the meter projects, we're sometimes cost -- almost 90% or more of the costs are shared with other customers in these behind-the-meter configurations, the data center companies pay for the infrastructure. Second, co-locating a data center with the power plant is just more efficient and it is faster, which can, I think the complaining utilities have acknowledged telling the FERC, \"significant new load can be served without having to expend resources on expensive system upgrades.\" That's from their filing. At a time when RTOs are struggling to integrate new resources faster and time is of the essence, this benefit is a big deal. Third, these behind-the-meter configurations are long dated. So they'll allow us to have the economic certainty to relicense nuclear plants and to operate them with all the attendant benefits that creates for the grid in our nation. Fourth, in terms of new clean generation, the common thesis for these forms of generation, whether they're SMRs or carbon sequestration technologies is to co-locate them with industrial and data center look. We've seen that countless number of times. For all these reasons, colocation will be an essential tool for maintaining our national security, developing new generation and our overall economic competitiveness. Friday's actions at the FERC may have slowed things but ultimately will be constructive in our view. Notably, FERC did not grant requests by a small number of utilities to set the Talen Energy ISA for hearing or in the alternative to reject it outright. Instead the FERC ordered a technical conference that will provide all parties with the opportunities to talk about the benefits of colocation as well as other issues. Likewise, we thought the language of the deficiency letter was narrow. In fact, it mirrored standard deficiency letter language about a higher burden approved for ISA modifications that we've seen in a number of other applications. Just as an example of this, in the last 12 months, excellent subsidiary, ComEd received two deficiency letters using the exact same language about a higher burden improved that we saw in the Talen letter. In both instances, the project was approved. Of course, look, we don't know what FERC ultimately will do with the Talen ISA, but we think the benefits are compelling and we look forward to the conference and we're confident that any fair examination of costs will support colocation. So at this point, we and our customers are continuing to make progress, and we hope to execute contracts. At the same time, on a parallel path, we'll participate in the FERC proceedings or in any proceeding where these matters are discussed. But that doesn't mean we won't have conversations with utilities outside these proceedings. In my view, transparency is part of who we are as a company and the more we could share with policymakers, utilities and all stakeholders about how these facilities will operate, how they'll interact with the grid and their benefits, the better for everyone. I just want you to remember that in the grand scheme of things, colocation is not a new idea. It's actually quite an old idea. As PSEG and others have noted, cogen or combined heat and power projects were the first co-locators since I think they were the first micro grids. And when I came into this business, those projects were a common feature of our system. And not surprisingly, utilities were not always friendly to cogen, at least not at first. But policymakers insisted on non-monopoly alternatives to power and things get better. Now we're dealing with a whole new generation of policymakers and regulators, including many that weren't around when the cogen policies were created. So we need to do a bit of work here to educate and inform. But importantly, we simply don't see this as a zero-sum game. There's a great opportunity for Constellation and for the utilities to work together to bring grid connected and co-located data economy growth projects to our states. Here's what I think. In the fullness of time, those jurisdictions that have clean energy centers like ours and offer both colocation and grid connection will be the most successful in generating business development and economic growth and jobs for their states. Now look, I want to close this part out by talking about something that I think kind of got missed in the overwhelming amount of conversation about the FERC process. I understand why there is a lot of attention on that, but we don't want to leave this topic without saying that we are making great progress on power sales for on grid data centers through our 24/7 product. Utilities across PJM, and I think you've seen this in a bunch of the earnings calls, have been highlighting the growth of data centers in their service territory. In total, as you could see on Slide 6, they now identified 50 gigawatts or more that would come in over time. Now look, in fairness, I think there's a bunch of duplication in those numbers and it's going to occur over a longish time line. But the point is, I think it's powerful that everyone is seeing the same thing, growth in this area. And those growth opportunities are good for Constellation because each of these grid data center projects, whether they're located in Illinois, Ohio or anywhere else in PJM or in other regions, they present an opportunity for our commercial team to sell clean and reliable power through our 24/7 product and other offerings to these clients. So in conclusion, we continue to have multiple ways to serve our data center customers, both behind-the-meter as well as grid connected and create value for all of our owners. Nothing over the last quarter has changed our outlook, how Constellation can meaningfully participate. Turning to Slide 7, our fleet performance is laid out in this slide. And as you can see here, nuclear performance was again strong and ahead of plan for the quarter. We produced more than 41 million megawatt hours of reliable, available and carbon free generation from our nuclear plants with a capacity factor of 95.4%. That's including refueling outages, which we completed in an average of 21 days, again, industry leading as always. Our renewables and natural gas fleet also performed well and exceeded our plan, with 96.6% of renewable energy capture and a 98% power dispatch match. Congratulations to those teams. Excellent work. Turning to Slide 8. We talk a lot about the advantage of creating value because our best-in-class carbon free generation fleet is combined with an industry leading commercial business, and the results here again demonstrate the validity of that point. Our commercial business thrives in volatile and changing markets. The markets we're seeing with spot and prices going up and down a bit throughout the course of the year. This quarter our team priced in higher margins to customers to manage their exposure to volatile prices through firm products that offer price certainty. They optimized not only our individual generation and load positions, but they created the best positions using both. And they sold customized sustainability solutions. On that point, we're seeing more evidence of our customers, not just data center customers, but customers as a whole, evolving in their sustainability journeys from buying annual clean energy products to starting to match their hourly consumption with clean energy. And again, I think the reliability to mention here plays hugely in the outstanding of customers that we need to match clean energy production with the time of use for their particular application. And they also understand that, that's the best way to ultimately make a difference in the environment and to manage the energy volatility. A good example that came to us this quarter when John Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab joined the growing list of high-profile customers that have turned to Constellation to power their operations with 24/7 carbon free energy. As we did with the Comcast contract, the McCormick contract that we highlighted on our last call, we spotlight this agreement with John Hopkins because it shows that it's just the hyperscalers. But rather a wide range of customers that are looking at 24/7 carbon free energy matching as the best solution. With that, I'll turn it over to Dan to cover the financial update. Daniel Eggers : Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 9, we earned $2.58 per share in GAAP earnings and $1.68 in adjusted operating earnings, which is $0.04 per share higher than last year. Our commercial business continues to perform exceptionally well, creating value by optimizing our generation and load positions, demonstrating how it thrives in volatile markets. We're also seeing margins above the long-term averages we use in our forecast, and above the enhanced margins we disclosed in February. This performance flowed through our quarterly results and contributed to our improved outlook for the year, which I'll discuss in a few minutes. Compared to last year, we benefited from the nuclear PTC. More nuclear output combined with lower costs and refueling outages and contribution from our ownership share in the South Texas project that closed last fall. And as discussed last quarter, our stock has performed very well year-to-date, which creates higher employee stock compensation expense year-over-year. Following on the quarter, we recognized $33 million in the Illinois ZEC program in June for banked credits, which is down a bit from the $218 million recognized last year. As you may recall, the Illinois ZEC program is subject to an overall cost cap as one of its consumer protection features. In earlier years of the program, we generated more credits than we could use under this mechanism. We were able to bank those credits for future years. For the 2023, 2024 planning year, the last second quarter, power prices had risen to a level where the ZEC price was nearly zero and we are instead able to use our bank ZECs to get back to the cost cap. For accounting reasons, we had to book these revenues at the start of the planning year and hence, the $218 million we recognized in the second quarter of 2023. This year, the forward prices have moderated and the ZEC credits for the 2024, '25 planning year will largely get us to the cap, using only $33 million of bank ZECs, which we then recognized this quarter. So taking all these impacts together, when you think about our second quarter results, our year-over-year quarterly earnings were $0.04 higher, would have been $0.44 per share higher, if not for the timing of when we recognize the Illinois ZEC credits. Instead, we'll see these credits flow as a positive driver for the remainder of the '24-'25 planning year and have always been part of our full year expectations. Moving to Slide 10. We are raising our full year adjusted operating earnings guidance outlook with the midpoint of guidance going from $7.63 to $8 per share with a new range of $7.60 to $8.40. Joe and I spoke about our strong commercial performance to date, and that performance enables us to increase our earnings outlook for the year. As you can see in the appendix on Slide 25, we increased our enhanced gross margin line by $450 million due to better optimization of our portfolio and higher commercial margins than planned. Our expectations for enhanced commercial margins improved by $0.15 to $1.90 per megawatt hour, which is on top of our base commercial margin of $3.50 to $3.60 a megawatt hour. In addition to an increase in stock compensation due to our share price, we have some O&M drag due to performance based compensation as a result of the commercial team's exceptional execution and value creation for our owners. Our ability to optimize our generation and load positions is not limited to 2024, but has extended into our 2025 outlook as well. We increased our 2025 enhanced gross margin expectation by $250 million, some of which is from strong commercial backlog creation. All the rest is due to the higher prices from the PJM capacity auction. So turning to Slide 11. Let's get into the financial impact of last week's capacity auction results. To level set everyone from the start, the nuclear PTC is now in place. So calculating the benefit from higher capacity prices is a little more involved than just a PxQ exercise. The nuclear PTC is a means based credit and is calculated by filling the gap between gross receipts so all the market based revenues coming to a plant and the PTC threshold value that we assume is $44.75 in 2025. What this means is that gross receipts per unit were below the PTC threshold of $44.75 in 2025. We expect to receive PTC revenues to get us to that level. For those units, the uplift from higher than anticipated capacity revenues following this auction must first replace the expected PTC that was bringing us to the PTC floor level before we're able to realize upside to earnings. For units that were already above the PTC floor, the full offside of the capacity price increase will be realized. Additionally, any revenues above the CMC price will be refunded to customers. So we do not realize any upside benefit for the three CMC plants in Illinois, even though they cleared the auction. With all that clarification, capacity prices were higher than our expectations. And comparing to where power prices were for both 2025 and 2026, we are now seeing many of our PJM plants at or above the PTC floor in providing earnings upside for us. Forwards for 2025 are lower than 2026, so more of the capacity revenue upside in 2025 goes first to offset the expected PTC contribution. The net earnings impact to 2025 was approximately $0.25 per share, which we reflected as part of the enhanced gross margin increase on Slide 25 of the appendix. For 2026, assuming that we carry through the same capacity prices in the 2026, 2027 capacity auction in December and used the end of quarter forward power prices. We would expect $1.25 per share increase in earnings against the previous assumption using $100 a megawatt day for the capacity auction. As a reminder, every penny of EPS is about $4 million pretax if trying to calibrate your forecast Turning to the financing and liquidity update on Slide 12. Our investment grade balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to have constructive conversations with the ratings agencies. During the second quarter, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program, completing $500 million of repurchases on top of the $500 million of repurchases we discussed on the first quarter call. We've now completed $1 billion year-to-date and $2 billion since the program began last year for a total of more than 16 million shares. We have roughly $1 billion remaining in our board authorized repurchase program and we have more than $2.3 billion of capital still to be allocated for 2024 and 2025, and before taking into account the improving earnings outlook for both of these years. We have considerable strategic flexibility to create further benefits for our shareholders through organic growth that meets our return thresholds or through investing directly in our company. We believe firm, clean megawatts are the most valuable commodity in the market today, and we have more nuclear generation in competitive markets than all of our peers combined. When we look at our ability to execute and create value as well as the opportunities ahead of us, we continue to view our stock as compelling and unfortunately, even more so since the last time we met. We will continue to invest directly in it through buying back our stock. I'll now turn the call back to Joe for his closing remarks. Joseph Dominguez : Thanks, Dan. Great job. Constellations like no other company. We have a unique set of existing assets that really can't be replicated that create opportunities for us that no one else has. At our core, we have a visible base earnings growth of 10% through the decade that is backstopped by the federal government through the nuclear PTC and has a built-in inflation adjusted. Backstop is a huge differentiator, especially as some investors start to become concerned about clouds in the economy. Our country needs what we have, clean and dependable power generation to drive economic growth. And the argument for that just got stronger as the year has progressed. We could support both national security and meet environmental goals. Power demand is growing and, at the same time, reliability is becoming a premium product and we have the most reliable generation in America. Increased demand, combined with the change of the electric system to more intermittent, non-dispatchable resources means that volatile power markets will continue. We have a commercial team that is very capable of addressing and earning margins from that volatility. We think Constellation is going to be a huge part of the solution for decades to come. Our clean and reliable nuclear plants, coupled with our ability to offer customers sustainability products will drive the U.S. energy transition and the growth in the data center economy. Politically, both Republicans and Democrats have consistently recognized that nuclear is both the backbone of our system from a reliability standpoint and is key to our sustainability goals. And that growth just -- that support just continues to grow, pardon me. On top of the opportunities we have from volatile power markets, we have more than 180 million megawatt hours of carbon free generation that we produced annually that can achieve additional compensation through in front of the meter deals, behind-the-meter deals, operates and other opportunities to invest in reliable clean energy and government procurements. Not many companies are growing at, at least 10% through the decade as their starting point with a federal backstop. But we're not satisfied with that. We think we will grow base earnings faster with both behind and in-front-of-meter customer deals and increasing our nuclear megawatts. On top of this, our commercial team is working to consistently create products and services that will capture additional value from the markets above our basis. That's our focus. That's what we do every day. So with that, let me turn it over back to you, Michelle to handle questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shar Pourreza : Joe, just starting with the colocation backdrop, does the FERC technical conference -- I think you kind of alluded to this, does it kind of prolong the time line for a deal announcement at this point? And can you give us just any color on timing of a potential deal or how your potential counterpart is your view in the ISA process right now? Joseph Dominguez : Shar, I think it could slow things down in terms of folks looking for certainty. But as we kind of think about it, right, you think about the ancillary services that people are debating here get the totality of those ancillary services is relatively small. We actually think it's zero just as PPL and Talen do in terms of the physical application we have. But even in allocation of these ancillary services is relatively a small amount. And if they're metered as PJM proposes, we're talking about really low dollars per megawatt hour $1 to $2 to $3 a megawatt hour at most. Those kinds of charges aren't going to change the economic viability of these projects even if they're imposed. And again, we think the better argument is no charge will be imposed in terms of the configuration we're talking about. So from our customers' perspective, it's about crafting provisions in the contract that allocate those contingencies to the extent they occur and we've had to kind of deal with that in the negotiations of the deal. But these things continue to march forward. I think in the long run, having clarity is going to be the most important thing and getting through this and Talen getting through its ISA and having clarity is only going to kind of speed up the process and speed up deal execution because people will then know exactly what they're contracting for. So that's kind of the way we see it. We're continuing to work forward. I don't think we need to wait until the end of a FERC process to announce a deal. Like I said, contracting provisions will handle all contingencies that might occur with regard to that FERC proceeding. And we really don't see an outcome here where the FERC is going to say, you can't do this. I mean we've outlined the four reasons in the script. I won't go through them again. But this is kind of a -- this is important on so many levels to get done. The policymakers in the states wanted to get done. And I think that message will come through loud and clear in the process. I actually think it's a good opportunity to educate and inform people and kind of get this all out there. This is, again, not a really new idea but it's new to me. And so we've got to walk through the process. Kathleen. I don't know if you have anything to add in terms of the timing of the conference what you expect to see. Kathleen Barron : No. I mean, I think you covered it, Joe. This kind of meeting is the kind of meeting that for holds from time to time, when they want to learn something about a topic. Last year, they had a technical conference on the EPA proposed 111D rule. And I've participated in these on both sides, both at the commissioner and as a stakeholder. And it really is a great opportunity for there to be interaction between stakeholders and the commissioners in an informal setting like a conference as opposed to doing solo litigation. So that we can answer questions, we can talk about the benefits as we see them and get the issues out there in the open in a setting where it's less adversarial than a litigated docket. And in terms of the Talen case, when we look at the narrowness of the deficiency letter, as Joe pointed out, it's very similar in language to other deficiency letters that have been issued on ISAs that have non-conforming language, asking very narrow question about why those provisions are necessary. You contrast that to what typically happens where there are long list of questions in deficiency letters reflecting concerns from the commission or questions from the commission. That does not occur here. So they really -- if you zoom out signaling that they intend to keep the Talen proceeding focused on the Talen fact, and then they're going to be standard tool that they have this tech conference to learn some more about the topic. So we see this as a very constructive way to move forward and, frankly, a responsible one on the FERC's behalf. Shar Pourreza : And then just lastly, BRA, I mean, I guess it's open to interpretation on whether we actually do in set new entry into the market. I guess, obviously, Joe, you're in discussions, what's your view on some of the commentary out of some of the T&D utilities and it's been topical on these calls is regarding just PPA or rate basing peakers in PJM if the market doesn't move fast enough. Joseph Dominguez : Yes, sure. I don't think that's really any different -- now have been in this business seemingly for so long that I remember these cycles over and over again. We've had these discussions before. But in states like Pennsylvania, states like Ohio, they've been pretty clear. A lot of alone places like Illinois, where I just think that conversation would be impossible. They've been very clear that they want the markets to work. And there's great evidence here that the PJM market has worked. We've seen high prices before in the PJM market. And in fact, even with these higher prices, the point I made in my opening remarks here is that we're still at a lower point than we were 15 years ago. And it's just -- it's a testament to the value of competition. I think stakeholders in those states get it. I think there is a genuine concern about the growth rates in terms of spending on the T&D system. And I don't see policymakers naturally going to the view that monopolization of the generation sector. Further monopolization of the generation sector is going to be the answer now, frankly, any more than I ever did. So we'll respond to those points. But right now, we just have a new FERC process in the capacity option. We need to give it the time to work. There's no evidence whatsoever through history or anything that's going on now, that competition isn't going to address this problem, right? So that's our view. Operator : Our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro : I was wondering does the outcome of the PJM auction just in terms of how high prices got, does that increase the urgency that you're hearing from potential data center counterparties to get some of these colocation deals done? Joseph Dominguez : Yes. I think it increases urgency, both in terms of that and also urgency in terms of locking down in-front-of-the-meter deals because it is a tightening market and people are saying that, and in particular, for clean and reliable megawatts, it creates a huge opportunity, I think, for Jim's business to go and meet the demand of these customers. And we're certainly seeing that. We've reshaped the team. We've refocused the team through a lot on Jim's part to go out and meet and address the needs of these customers, and we're seeing a pretty significant appetite there. I think it also signals that even with the forecasted growth, right, because the data center growth was in the forecast that PJM used when it ran the auction, its evidence that we have the supply needed in PJM to address this data center growth. So I think it was a positive on two fronts. I think now we have the forecast and the market still responded with enough generation to meet the reliability needs of the system. And -- but at the same time, we do see a tightening in the market and people need to get moving to lock up their supply. So I think it's additive. David Arcaro : And then another question that we've had is as you're working on data center deals, should we be assuming that dual unit plants make the most sense with one unit acting as backup? Or is there demand or certain structures where you could fully contract a dual unit plant? What would that structure potentially look like? Joseph Dominguez : For us that we started with the dual units because that made the most sense, right? One, as you noted, one unit becomes the natural backup for the other unit during outages. But as we've gotten smarter in this, it really depends on the type of data center, whether it's an inference data center or a learning data center. And it really depends on what the hyperscaler intends to evolve the facility. I don't think we've seen all the configurations, and I could easily see circumstances where behind-the-meter data centers are located in the same region as on-grid data centers and effectively provide reliability through fiber as opposed to through wires and backup generation, where on-grid picks up behind-the-meter data needs when the data center is in outage mode. So we could see those configurations -- I could frankly see those configurations evolving even after the unit stations. We're learning a lot. It's -- despite the enthusiasm, we certainly feel it and we know our owners feel it. We're still fairly early innings in terms of understanding all of the different use cases and how our resources will interact with the grid, and we'll interact with these customers. Honestly, I think in talking to them, the customers are still figuring it out. So I at this point, wouldn't rule out anything. We do think the most natural place is the dual-unit site, both in terms of the volume of electricity and the natural backup, we think those are going to be the first sites to be selected. And so far, it appears to be the case. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : Sorry, I wanted to just try to kind of better clarify a little bit more on the colocation kind of time line. So I think we'll have a technical conference in the fall, but I don't think we're going to get kind of any next step from that probably until sometime in 2025, most likely, policy statement [206] or whatever? And I guess, we will have a Talen outcome by the fall. So just in terms of thinking about just a realistic time frame to kind of get the -- be helpful to get clarity, as you said. I mean is this something that we should kind of not expect to hear more until sometime next year? Or is this something that we could still see something happen even this year, even as these things are still kind of in process? Joseph Dominguez : Let me -- I think something you're referring to is a deal done, right? Steven Fleishman : Yes. Joseph Dominguez : Yes. So Steve, I don't think we're time bounded by ultimately clarity in the FERC process. I do think the Talen ISA is going to be instructive and folks are watching that to make sure kind of it goes through or what conditions might get attached to that. But we independently are working on contractual provisions that will allow us to manage whatever outcome comes out of those proceedings. And so, at least for the moment, we're working with our customers towards finalizing deals. And I could certainly see a circumstance where those things get announced and there's still some process going on at FERC or some discussion among stakeholders. Steven Fleishman : And then just on, one, this has been a very public kind of gotten very noisy process. And I would assume some of these customers don't really love kind of seeing that inside. So just is that in a way impacting at all the ability to kind of get things done with the customers? Is that a concern? Joseph Dominguez : Not yet, Steve. But the customers are paying attention to this, and by the way, so are the policymakers. Look, if this stuff is happening, and I'll just -- Talen is not our deal, but I'll use it as an illustrate. Talen in that arrangement is bringing $10-plus billion maybe more than $20 billion of economic development to a region that, if we're going to be honest hasn't seen a lot of sunshine from an economic development standpoint of this dimension in a long, long time. And I think it's fair to say that policymakers around Pennsylvania like to see that for communities like this that need jobs and economic opportunities. And I think it's fair to extrapolate from that, that they won't like it very much if people interfere with those things and cause it to come off the rails. And so I think the policymaker reaction, the labor reaction, which, of course, drives policymakers in many of our jurisdictions, they're all pretty important factors. So I think we'll see that play out. I think that pushes parties to try to work these things out. The other thing is, from a customer standpoint, right, you want to be in a jurisdiction that is pro and friendly to data centers and gives these companies every option. And I think in the early innings, that probably isn't the case. And I noticed that you pointed that out in some of your research. So look, we're not at a place right now where people are signing have a circle around a particular jurisdiction with a red stripe through like ghost busters thing. But I think people are paying attention to it. Policymakers want this to happen. They want the parties to work it out. So at the end of it, we will go anywhere we need to go to have the discussion. If we could only have the discussion in proceedings state or federal, we'll have the discussions in state or federal proceedings. But we think the clear signal from what happened at FERC from the rejection of ban legislation in Maryland is to tell parties work these issues out. This economic development is important. I don't think we're the only ones hearing that message. And we'll strive and we do this every day to have conversations. You don't have to have every policy conversation in a proceeding. And frankly, if we did, regulators and lawmakers would never sleep. So we need to continue to have those discussions. I just -- in my view, Steve, it's this. If you have clean energy centers in your jurisdiction and you could offer that opportunity, that's a huge advantage for the incumbent utility to make the state a place that's friendly to the data economy. And what we've seen before is one data center attracts more because they kind of work together. So I just think the approach here of thinking about this as a zero-sum game is really just kind of the wrong mindset. And I think we just got to kind of get through that phase, and where you're working very hard to do it. Our owners expect us every day to work on the things that bring the spectacular results that our team is announcing today. And that's what we want to be working on. We don't want to be tied up in proceedings all over the place. We will if we have to, but we prefer to resolve these issues in a way that's friendly to what policymakers want and what customers want. That's what we aim to achieve. Operator : We have time for one last question, and that question comes from Paul Zimbardo with Jefferies. Paul Zimbardo : Lots of good content today. I wanted to shift and kind of run with that last one you mentioned a little bit, I know we're all focused on FERC but you mentioned Maryland. Just holistically, what are some of your state legislative priorities to support the colocation strategy? I know Maryland has Senate bill one, if you could just comment more broadly, what kind of the focuses are at the state level? Joseph Dominguez : Well, I think we're going to be largely reactive to what we're seeing. But we will work with customers, with labor unions and others to make sure that all opportunities remain on the table for economic growth. But we're sitting here thinking about launching legislation. We think this is like the cogen stuff that I alluded to are the micro-grid stuff that we've talked about, largely handled in the regulatory arena. Paul Zimbardo : And I know in your prepared remarks, you talked about some of the customer bill impacts from the PJM auction, some of the benefits for all parties from the colocation strategy, but just curious if you have any initial estimate of like what the benefits would be in terms of rate returns for rate payers, if there was like a hypothetical 1 gigawatt data center colocation. Some of your peers have kind of put out some numbers, but curious if you've done the analysis there you're willing to share? Joseph Dominguez : Well, I will point to either Kathleen or David Dardis, our General Counsel. We could talk certainly about some of what we've presented in our case, but we have generally seen billion dollars of costs associated with a gigawatt of load, right? And in jurisdictions where a lot of that is socialized, 90% or more and frankly, I think that's an underestimate because that just includes kind of direct substation market. It doesn't include the work behind the substation that may be necessary, but we see some jurisdictions where a lot of that is spread out to many other customers in our applications, those hyperscalers are paying for the connection. Now if not $1 billion because the connection is occurring right at the plant, which is the point, right? So what we're doing is creating switchyards and other things that are 1/10 of those costs to connect the certain amount of load. But you could see easily a factor of 10x, I actually think it's more when you talk about putting a data center out on the grid somewhere. And a lot of those costs get socialized to customers that aren't the hyperscalers. And so that's the real benefit. But the other thing that, look, Paul, when we're talking about this, we are pretending as if the grid could easily host 1 gigawatt of load. When I was at ComEd, the largest load we ever had in the system was steel mills at 150 megawatts, right? If -- when I was General Counsel at PICO, the largest -- one of the largest loads we had were the refineries in Philadelphia, 60 megawatts, 70 megawatts. The notion that you could accumulate enough power somewhere on the grid to power 1 gigawatt data center is frankly laughable to me that you could do that in anywhere that doesn't start with decades of time, right? This is an enormous amount of power to go out and try to concentrate it. Think about it. You're building 345 kV lines with all the attendant substations to create all of the redundancy, each one of those substations having to draw power from an independent source. It just it has always made sense. This is not new, it's always made sense that when you're talking about large loan, you're going to bring it closer to large generation resources. And when you're talking about large load that also wants to use your own mission energy, you're going to bring it very close to nuclear power plants. We need to make sure that policies don't inadvertently drive us to spending billions of dollars where cheaper solutions are available, quicker solutions are available. And from an electrical engineering standpoint, more prudent and, frankly, feasible solutions are available. So we're going to have those policy discussions, but I think that's what's going to be revealing in the FERC discussion. And it's powerful. If you want to take a look at one document that I think lays this out pretty clearly, Mike Formo, who for many, many years, was the leader of transmission -- all things transmission at PJM published a report. He is also Senior Vice President of Transmission for Exelon for a period of time in his career, about issues I just described, the feasibility of connecting and the cost of connecting super large loads somewhere on the grid as opposed to colocation. And he lays it out pretty succinctly in his expert report. Those are the things we'll be talking about to regulators and policymakers. There's going to be opportunities for data centers in both places, but dimensionally, the bigger we get, the closer we're going to be to the generation source if we are going to have any chance of doing this in a manner that addresses the nation's need for timely action. Operator : Thank you. I'd like to turn the call back over to Joe Dominguez for any further remarks. Joseph Dominguez : Well, thank you. We've had a great beginning to the year. And again, just want to give a shout out to all of our folks that made it happen. We really feel strongly about our performance to date, we really feel strongly about what we think we're going to be able to accomplish in the balance of the year and the work we're doing. I appreciate the robust discussions we've had today around colocation. One always gets concerned that one particular issue distracts from the overall benefits of the company that are really laid out in the last slide we have in the deck about the unique opportunities we have here. We're super excited about them. We appreciate your attention, your focus on Constellation, your ownership and I guarantee you, we'll continue to focus on the things that create value for you. With that Michelle, end the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Thank you for standing by and welcome to Constellation Energy Corporation's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session; instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Emily Duncan, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Strategic Growth. Please, you may begin. Emily Duncan : Thank you, Latif [ph]. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining Constellation Energy Corporation's third quarter earnings conference Call. Leading the call today are Joe Dominguez, Constellation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Eggers, Constellation's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Constellation's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning, along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Constellation's website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates regarding Constellation and its subsidiaries that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Constellation's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other circumstances and considerations that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. I'll now turn the call over to Joe Dominguez. Joseph Dominguez : Thanks, Emily. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and a big thank you to our amazingly talented team at Constellation. Today, Dan and I once again have the privilege to share their results, results that outperform our plan, your expectations and require us to raise guidance. But before I do that, I want to touch upon Friday's FERC ruling that I know is top of mind for many folks. In Constellation's view, the 2 :1 ruling rejecting Talen's ISA by a fraction of the commission is not the final word from FERC on colocation. The ruling, as many of you know, is very narrow and we believe that all of the commissioners, including the 2 who refuse themselves from Friday's decision, understand the critical importance of providing additional guidance. Now, how that's going to come could occur in a number of different ways. We could see the commission take action, we could see PJM take action or parties like ourselves could take action. It's premature at this point to say which of those pathways we are going to pursue. But we know this; colocation in competitive markets remains one of the best ways for the U.S. to quickly build the large data centers that are necessary to lead on AI. As Chairman, Phillips explained, our nation's entire economy and national security is at stake if we do not lead in AI. That sentiment is shared by both presidential candidates. As National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan warned just 2 weeks ago but even if we have the best AI models but our competitors are faster to deploy, we could see them seize the advantage in using AI capabilities against our people, our forces and our partners and allies [indiscernible]. We all know that power has emerged as the key to America's ability to meet the challenge and Constellation uniquely is positioned to help. There are multiple regulatory and commercial pathways to resolve the colocation issues and we will work quickly with customers and other stakeholders to put these in place. In PJM, we have abundant baseload power almost all times of the year. We can power AI. I think sometimes we get sloppy and say, we have energy issues with AI growth. We don't. We have a capacity issue that manifests itself just a few hours of the year. This problem is fairly simple to address with demand response, peakers and batteries, all provided that we have the right market price signals. But to be fair, we have been a bit challenged on the issue of getting the capacity market moving. Now we agree with PJM's decision to delay the latest auction and we encourage PJM to do that because we support changing the reference unit and addressing the RMR units. Those narrow reforms should provide clarity, fair pricing and price stability for customers and generators alike. PJM should also proceed with streamlining the process for adding generation like our Crane restart. We're happy to see PJM progressing on this front and we're working hard to bring Crane on in 2027. We trust that FERC will prioritize these RPM matters and urge FERC to act on them quickly. The load is going up and the market needs the price signal to react. We note that the recent utility filings with PJM already indicate another 5 to 6 gigawatts of load in the next auction that we expect PJM to implement in its planning parameters. The PJM capacity market has a long track record of being able to deliver new capacity and to drive customer demand response but we need to let it work. Colocation will add, not detract from reliability in PJM. Here, Constellation's principles have been quite simple. First, in times of emergency, our power should support the grid. To be absolutely clear about what I'm saying, that means that nuclear energy supporting a co-located load will be switched to the grid when needed to prevent the reliability crisis and it should be fairly compensated when so called. Second, if the co-located load has backup power, it should be allowed to offer that power to the grid, subject, of course, to state and environmental permitting rules. Third, co-located load should pay its fair share of grid costs for what it uses. These issues should be brought together and advanced at FERC. Frankly, I think part of the issue with the ISA proceeding is that it did not bring these issues together and understandably, some of the commissioners want to see the complete package. We will pursue this regulatory clarity, while simultaneously pursuing commercial strategies for colocation that are permitted under existing rules. Now, turning to our results and guidance updates. In the third quarter, our 14,000-person team here at Constellation delivered GAAP earnings of $3.82 per share and adjusted operating earnings of $2.74 per share. Due to this strong performance, we are raising and narrowing our adjusted operating earnings guidance for the full year to $8 to $8.40 per share. This brings our midpoint to $8.20 per share, a whopping $0.60 per share above our original guidance midpoint and we remain bullish on the balance of the year. Our core value proposition is strong and our strategy remains on track. We will provide -- we will grow our base EPS by at least 13% through 2030, growth that is backstopped by nuclear production tax credit. We have the best operated and largest fleet of carbon-free, reliable nuclear plants that run 24/7 and we will be needed by the energy system for decades to come. These assets will benefit from both increasing demand for carbon-free electricity and reliable power. Through our industry-leading C&I business, we provide the innovative products and services our customers want. Our strong investment-grade balance sheet, along with strong free cash flows that can continue to be used for growth, meet our threshold and provide valuable opportunities for you, our owners. And finally, as you've seen this year, we have the ability to do better than our base level of earnings through multiple paths, including optimizing our portfolio and getting better-than-average margins. It's been an incredible 3 years for Constellation, a remarkable journey that perhaps is best epitomized by the restart of the Crane Clean Energy Center that we announced in September. Crane validates 3 points that we have discussed many times before. First, it's a powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear energy. And it happens at a location that once came to represent nuclear energies demise. Second, it confirms our thesis that the most valuable energy commodity in the world today is clean and reliable electricity. And third, it underscores the growing demand for 24/7 clean energy, driven by the data economy, onshoring and electrification. All of these macro points benefit our owners. We have talked about them before and I don't think we need to talk about it much more because by now, these points have become self-evident. In addition to Crane, we have at least 1,000 megawatts of additional nuclear generation that we could bring on to the grid through uprates. And I'm pleased to report to you that we are seeing a wave of interest from customers who are interested in these opportunities and in our relicensing and we are making significant progress on contracting. The intensity of our negotiations with hyperscalers and others keeps going up and up. Our entire team is focused on executing transactions and supporting data center development anywhere in PJM. Now, I want to emphasize the word anywhere. Recall that when Microsoft announced the Crane offtake agreement, they explained that their agreement with Constellation enables them to use the energy in 4 different states, not just Pennsylvania. That should tell you that Constellation easily construct the transactions to sell energy, capacity and sustainability products to data economy customers anywhere in PJM and in some cases, outside of PJM. And we can make those fixed price deals for as long as our counterparties desire. That's pretty unique to us. The governors in the states where we operate clean energy centers certainly understand the national security imperative and the value of economic development in their states. They want us to use the clean energy in their states and we want that too but we will follow the customers to all utilities and regions that are working with us to advance economic development and meet the vital national security needs of the nation. So as we look forward to the inevitable regulatory certainty and flexibility on co-location that Chairman Phillips emphasized in his descent, Constellation is continuing to hit on all cylinders on colocation opportunities, grid sales and in delivering new megawatts to the grid at attractive prices. We are proud that no one, no one is doing more to sustain and increase clean and reliable energy for America than Constellation. And we continue to lead research on new nuclear energy designs, such as SMRs and for natural gas with sequestration. Our partnership with Rolls-Royce Nuclear is advancing a very promising SMR design and we are working with other SMR developers as well. Our pioneering investment in NET Power is poised to undergo advanced engineering tests at our facility in La Porte, Texas. And we're partnering with GE on engineering tests and a pre-FEED study for CCUS at Colorado Bend. As I've said to you many times before, natural gas is a big part of our bridging strategy and we continue to be a player in natural gas provided we have a real pathway to sustainability. Because while powering the data economy is vital to our nation, defeating the climate crisis is vital to the world. In conclusion, our people are leading on all fronts. The 13% compounded growth that we've committed to you through the end of the decade is secure and we're very confident that we will outperform this target as we layer in new opportunities, just as you have seen us continuously outperform quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Turning to Slide 6. Nuclear performance was once again strong. We produced more than 41 million-megawatt hours of a reliable, available and carbon-free generation from our nuclear plants with a capacity factor of 95%. Our refueling outage performance was exceptional during the quarter. We completed 2 refueling outages during the quarter with each lasting less than 18 days on average. Great job to Bryan Hanson, David Rhoades and their team. For the year, our average is under 20 days; tracking 2 days are almost 10% below our historical averages and well below the industry average of 40 days. Our renewables and natural gas fleet similarly performed very well with 96% renewable energy capture and 98.2% power dispatch matching. Turning to Slide 7. We talk a lot about the advantage of creating value between our best-in-class generation fleet and our exceptional commercial business. Our results this year are further proof of the strategic advantages of the combination of these businesses. This is an area where the numbers, not the words, do most of the talking and you could see from the numbers just how spectacularly the commercial team has performed. We performed so well because our customer business is meeting demand in many ways, including through our CORe+ and CFE products, where we enable new renewable generation to be built and carbon-free electricity to be shared with our customers. Since 2020, our CORe+ business has grown by leaps and bounds as customers look for products to help them meet their energy and sustainability goals. As I mentioned before, through this product, 2,800 megawatts of wind and solar have been added to the system, helping to meet not only our customers' needs but the systems needs. We think CORe+ is a great way for customers to move forward on their sustainability efforts and it's a complementary pathway to our elite CFE product that provides 24/7 time and geographically matched clean energy. I'm now going to turn the call over to Dan for the financial update. Dan? Daniel Eggers : Thank you, Joe and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 8, we earned $3.82 per share in GAAP earnings and $2.74 per share in adjusted operating earnings which was $0.61 higher than last year. Starting with the generation, when we look at the quarter and the year, we've seen actual power prices materialize well below the outlook at the start of the year largely given weather-driven declines in natural gas prices as well as generally good renewables performance. Fortunately, with the Nuclear PTC now in place, the means-based tax credit worked like it was supposed to providing the revenue support as anticipated and helping us to meet our expectations. We also benefited from the earnings contribution from our interest in the South Texas project which we acquired late last year. Turning to the commercial business. As Joe mentioned, we continue to perform exceptionally well. The team has done an excellent job managing the variability in loads and market prices, reinforcing how it thrives in volatile markets. We're also continuing to see margins above the long-term averages we use in our forecast and above the enhanced margins we disclosed in February. Finally, as we discussed last quarter, our financial results and our stock have continued to perform very well year-to-date which results in higher employee compensation expense year-over-year. Altogether, we had a strong third quarter that is contributing to our improved outlook for the year. Before I turn to guidance, given the timing of our announced Crane restart and where negotiations were during the quarter following our second quarter earnings call, we were unable to be in the market and unfortunately did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. We still have approximately $1 billion of share buybacks currently authorized by the Board. As well as $1.8 billion of unallocated capital for the 2024-2025 period which I should remind is not updated for the increase in 2024 earnings guidance or outlook for 2025. Moving to Slide 9; we are raising the midpoint and narrowing full year adjusted operating earnings guidance. The updated midpoint goes from $8 per share to $8.20 with a range of $8.00 to $8.40. The new range is effectively above the top end of our guidance of our original guidance range of $7.23 million to $8.03 per share. The commercial business continues to outperform plan, allowing us to increase our earnings outlook for the year once again. As you can see in the appendix on Slide 21. We increased our enhanced gross margin by $275 million as a result of the commercial team's continued strong performance, created an additional value compared to plan through the optimization of our portfolio. As previously discussed, we are seeing higher O&M due to the strong earnings results and stock comp. On the fourth quarter call, we will roll forward our earnings guidance and other disclosures to include 2026. As you think through your modeling and as reflected in the disclosures in this deck, I want to remind you that we'll have more refueling outages in 2026 than in 2025 and these outages will be longer than our average outages because we'll be installing the first of our planned uprates at Byron and Braidwood. As a result, we will produce less electricity and have higher O&M. In addition, we expect the PTC 4 to be flat in 2025. We still forecast at least 13% compound base EPS growth through 2030 and we'll look for ways to further enhance our opportunity from here. Thank you. And I'll turn the call back to Joe. Joseph Dominguez : Thanks, Dan. Good job as always. Folks Constellation is like no other company. We have a unique set of existing assets that creates opportunities that no one else has. As Dan and I both hit, we expect to see 13% compounded growth through the end of the decade, uniquely; it's backstopped by the federal government. We're the best operator of nuclear plants in the world and our plant's performance is only getting better. We have 20% of market share in competitive -- with competitive C&I customers. And that's allowed us to have the products and services that now we are uniquely using with the data economy customers. Our strategy from the beginning is to provide America solutions to its energy problems and we're doing that. We're not done as a company, not far from done. Power demand is growing and at the same time reliabilities becoming a premium product. We don't need to look further than the recent capacity auctions and the load growth projections to see that. We see increased demand from the data economy but also from electrification and from onshoring. And it's going to mean that our resources are more important than ever. We have opportunities in the data economy for front of the meter deals. We've shown that through clean. We've shown that through our CFE product and we continue to see opportunities behind the meter in co-location. We've got 2,000 megawatts of new nuclear that we bring to the grid beginning in 2027. So think about that. That's 2,000 megawatts, roughly the equivalent of Vogtle and we think we could get that done all within the next handful of years. We're going to benefit from government procurements from clean energy and we're going to be able to capture energy and capacity prices above the PTC floor. Finally, I'd just like to say something about tomorrow's election and how it could impact us at Constellation. We're proud that nuclear energy has strong and bipartisan support from federal and state policymakers and from the American people. And in fact, the majority of Americans support nuclear. Congress has passed several pieces of pro-nuclear legislation in recent years, including the ADVANCE Act which passed Congress with strong bipartisan support. You'll recall and we've told you this before that the origins of the production tax credit came from Republicans in the House and the Senate. And both, Vice President, Harris and former President, Trump; have been strong supporters of existing and new nuclear during their time in the office. Politically and unfortunately, there are deep divisions in the country. But all Americans want clean and reliable energy and we're proud to provide what they want. We're proud to provide what our customers and our communities want, no matter who wins tomorrow, who are going to continue to do that. With that, Latif [ph], we'll end our prepared remarks and open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan Securities. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to come back to post FERC here and thoughts. Just wondering if Constellation were to pursue more front-of-the-meter deals, how do you think that, I guess, impacts value creation and speed to market relative to, I guess, behind the meter solutions here. It seems like there's still an opportunity to get to the same place but just wondering any other thoughts that you can share. Joseph Dominguez : Yes, Jeremy, our foot is on the accelerator pressed all the way down on deals, whether they're front or behind the meter. And so we're pursuing both. I think -- we've, as I said, demonstrated through Crane, our ability to use our power stations to support data center development anywhere. And so I think that's going to create some real opportunities for partnering with utilities that want to ensure that customers in their region or their utility get first access to clean and reliable power so that they could meet their growth objectives and we look forward to partnering with them and customers who want to be in those areas. Speed to market is very clearly the most important thing for customers. And so that's going to depend on the transmission configuration in different places and certain places are going to be frankly, more attractive to others for the data economy customers and we're going to follow them where they need to go. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That makes sense. And then I guess also looking at the state level, you see certain states out there really looking to promote the data economy development in their states. And I think there's some actions coming out of the governors to really promote, I guess, quicker speed to market interconnect queue timelines and just wondering any other thoughts that you could share there as far as what could be done on the state level? Joseph Dominguez : Yes, that's the irony of it. I have no -- look, I've talked to every governor in states from which we operate clean energy centers. And I could assure you that they all want to get this economy going, they understand that it's important for national security but it's also critically important for economic development in their states. And moreover, they understand this kind of fundamental point that they are part of an interstate grid. So that if they don't build the power from power plants that might be in their state is going to flow to different places, where those data centers are going to be built and those states are going to get the economic benefits, the jobs, the taxes, all the other things that come with it. So I see it as a circumstance where they're all leaning into this. And I think we will see more of that lean more aggressively into trying to advance rules at FERC and trying to do things that attract data center development to their jurisdictions. And that's Republicans and Democrats alike. So we're following that closely. We -- as I said, we'll continue to meet with utilities that we have common interest with and want to really advance data economy development work in those states and we could go anywhere. We've -- we have been selling hundreds of terawatt hours every year to customers across PJM and other RTOs. We know how to do that. We know how to manage the risk. We know what our costs are going to be 10, 20 years from now. We know how to get capacity to all places. And as more transmission is built, we'll be able to move even more capacity in a different place. So we'll follow the customers where they go, that's the entire focus of Jim's team and the work that Kathleen and others are doing right now. And that's what I have said before that the discussion with hyperscalers is only ramping up. It's about this sort of thing. How do they buy the energy capacity that they could deploy wherever they want. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Shar Pourreza : I appreciate sort of the color you're giving around sort of the markets and stuff. But maybe just if you could speak a little more to the transmission capacity within the ComEd and PECO zones around your plants as you see it. I mean, one of your peers has pitched capacity in its primary zone is kind of advantageous in the shift towards more front of the meter deals. And obviously, some of the stock reactions we're seeing this morning is prompting that. So I just want to get a little bit more color there? Joseph Dominguez : Yes. Look, sure, I think both from a temporal standpoint, a long-term standpoint, we happen to operate in markets that have fairly robust transmission capabilities, right? When you think about the ComEd zone, as an example, it has probably the most robust export capabilities of any zone within PJM. I think numerically, that's accurate. And we're seeing new transmission are being built all over the place, that's really expanding that. So the ability to move energy and capacity in different places is growing really as the plans come into fruition and transmission is built. But there's a lot of lanes right now for us to move our power. So that's what we're exploring. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Okay, perfect. And then just the pathways to getting FRCC, some clarity on BTM tariffs. I guess what is the -- what do you see as kind of a realistic time line? I had a conference on Friday, could be a new chair next year with the election tomorrow. I guess what is the fastest this could get resolved at this point. Do you wait for [indiscernible]? Can you or PJM do something to expedite? I mean there's a lot of options that are being thrown around but nothing seems to be a quick fix besides shifting to sort of in front of the meter. Joseph Dominguez : Yes. Look, I probably would agree with you that there's not a quick fix. But by that, I mean, it's not going to happen tomorrow but there are a lot of parties interested in moving this forward. People are reacting to the tech conference. I think a bigger development wasn't the ISA which was a narrow thing. But how do we deal with the comments that came out of the tech conference and craft something globally that addresses those comments. I touched a little bit on that in terms of the principles that we think would be the framework for a bigger deal. How that happens, I don't think we're literally, what, 72 hours away from the tech conference and still putting that together. We're meeting with counterparties and we'll figure out how to move forward. I don't know if FERC at this point is going to take the lead, PJM will, or other parties will. I think it's just too early in the game for us to say that. But look, I think there's a strong appetite. I don't care who's in the White House. AI is going to be a growing importance. I fundamentally believe this sure -- this is the issue of our time. It transcends the energy business. This is the issue that will define America's success in this century, whether we lead or fall behind is going to be of critical importance. That may not be universally known to others, clearly, Chairman, Phillips, understood that with great clarity the other day in his comments. But not everybody does right now -- in November of 2024 -- handful [indiscernible] to next year. I think that whole picture will change and the energy around this issue is going to intensify and FERC and others will have to clear up these rules quickly. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman : I guess, I'd like to -- Joe, you talked about some kind of colocation broad thematics that including the first one being that nuclear would be switched to the grid for emergencies and be fairly compensated. Could you just talk more to that because that -- it seems like a little different than at least the things that we've seen so far structurally. So I'd like to give more color on how that would work. And then tied in with that, the DR aspect with the data center since that's been kind of a challenge since they run all the time. If you could talk to those 2 issues, be helpful. Joseph Dominguez : Yes, sure, Steve. Let me do it kind of backwards. I think we've seen historically; we have lots of megawatts show up of demand response when the price signals within PJM are consistent and sufficiently robust for commercial industrial customers like ours to pull back energy consumption during peak out. And the challenge, frankly, for that DR market isn't that the thesis doesn't work, it's that prices dropped so precipitously in capacity markets that it no longer made sense for businesses to participate to be willing to disrupt their business. But at the price levels we saw in the last auction to the extent that prices in that vicinity are sustained, I see a re-emergence of DR as an immediate resource that's going to address some of these hours of peak demand. That's what I was talking about. And I think we're in a good spot because we have those customers, those clients that could respond. And so I happen to know from our commercial team that we believe that those folks will respond if the price signal is right. So that's kind of the answer to that. But we've got to get this capacity market up and running. We can't be doing hand wringing about capacity and then at the same time, keep tweaking and delaying auctions that setting the price signals to the market so that market responds. We know historically the market always responds. So that's point one. Point two, what I'm talking about in terms of the nuclear units returning is -- and I think we're seeing some of this in ERCOT at some level, right, of advanced warning when the grid reaches some level and it's kind of multi-step hierarchy of a grid crisis, the nuclear unit will shut down the co-located load and cut back to the grid. And so we can get some legs under that exactly when it will happen. But that's something we're absolutely willing to do and our customers understand we will do. So this kind of notion that we're taking the energy off the grid and it never comes back or some kind of unrealistic fantasy that the grid is down, data center is up surrounding the nuclear plant is just -- it's a poor narrative. It's not -- doesn't accurately reflect what will happen. We will always go back to the grid as promising. In terms of being compensated, we have offered solutions that allow us to continue to participate in the capacity market and return to the grid in all configurations when needed. Now unfortunately, in the past, as an isolated issue that didn't make its way through the PJM committee process. But my point in my opening comments is we've got to bring all of this back together in response to what we heard at the tech conference and provide a credible and viable pathway for the nukes to come back when needed but also to serve the co-located load that is vital for this AI development. Steve Fleishman : One other, I guess, follow-up question. Just in the event that you wanted to shift to co-located structures that are more, I guess, front of the meter. Could you give us a sense of just the timeline that delay that, that would cause in your kind of key regions relative to being able to do it behind the meter. Joseph Dominguez : Yes. Look, I don't know, Steve. It will probably require some more study process but I think we've got -- it's going to depend on what the transmission is around the site, how long that study process will be. I think it is a bit of a longer solution but I think it could be staged cooperatively in a manner that really doesn't cost that much time. We have some ideas about how we will do that in accordance with the existing tariffs that allow us to get to the end state fairly quickly. We're probably going to be a little careful here on an earnings call spelling out exactly how that will work. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo of Jefferies. Unidentified Analyst : It's Julian [ph]. I appreciate it. Just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the sort of the cadence of the last 2 questions and asking, how do you think about [indiscernible] confidence is probably pretty key here right now. How do you think about being able to come to market with whatever it is, whether it's a behind meter type arrangement or some sort of portfolio in front of the meter type deal. How do you think about Friday representing any kind of setback in timeline on your front? Or do you think that you're still front foot here in terms of being able to bring something to market sooner than later? Joseph Dominguez : Look, I think Friday is just what I said. I think it's a narrow ruling by 3 commissioners. I'm not even sure that's the ruling we would have seen if the 2 commissioners didn't recuse themselves. So -- it's going to be dependent on how fast. We always anticipated after the tech conference, there would be a process to deal with issues that came up. So that has been in our thinking from a strategic standpoint and in the thinking of our customers. And I just don't over-rotate on what happened on Friday and the ISA because I don't think that really brought the issues together in the most favorable way. So my point is, from our internal planning, it's kind of the same thing. In terms of front-end of the meter deals, we're doing that already. We've done it with dozens and dozens of customers already in PJM and you'll see those numbers in our disclosures. So -- and as well as the operates and other opportunities. Those things are moving along at pace and if anything, have intensive after the Microsoft deal with Crane, the appetite and desire to talk to us about the uprates has gone up pretty considerably. So we're moving at pace on all of those things. And I think they're all going to be additive to the 13%. We just got to get the deals done and incorporate them into our numbers and you'll see it. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. I appreciate all this takes some time, right. I mean obviously, TMI it took a lot of planning. How do you think about the upgrade structures here? I mean, obviously, there's incremental megawatts potential here. But as you think about contracting here, would you think of that as being kind of an opportunity to recontract entire plants? Or would you think about this being more discrete to the additionality provided by the specific megawatt upgrades? What you think about the structure of that timing? Joseph Dominguez : All of the above. But guys, I think we're seeing such interest in the operates that we want to package it with other opportunities, okay? I think I have fewer operates than I have customers to sell them to. So there's a scarcity of that product. And so that tells us we should pair it with other things that we care about. Relicensing are another thing, that hyperscalers want to be a part of and support, right? So that makes a good pairing. So, I think about the uprates as a scarce opportunity that we have at Constellation and an opportunity we want to share with customers that are interested in a broader, more strategic relationship and perhaps just the uprates. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro : Wondering what's the perspective that you're hearing from the hyperscalers? What's the urgency level? Are they worried about regulatory issues in PJM? Are they sticking with PJM and still looking for behind-the-meter approach? Any changes in their thinking? Joseph Dominguez : David, where are they going to go? Right. It's not like it's a lot better anywhere else than PJM. I think the reality everyone is facing is simply this. This power issue has become unlocking the whole deal. They're investing billions and as you can see from their disclosures, they're not slowing the pace of their investment. But what they're seeing is that there's no Nirvana out there. There's no place where you could easily hook up the amount of energy that they're looking to hook up. So no, I don't -- I don't see them as saying, \"Oh, no, PJM is not the place to go.\" I think competitive markets and PJM very much remain on their list of priority sites. But the truth of all of this and I think Phillips added exactly right, is this is going to require a degree of regulatory flexibility and creativeness that's going to stretch everybody. And that's not true, by the way, in vertically integrated markets than it is here. And you see that time and again. What won't -- I'll tell you what won't be the solution and I know this with absolute certainty. They're not going to wait around for 10 years until somebody builds a power plant transmission lines to power the data economy. If that's the U.S. plan, then we've got bigger problems than picking the right RTO. David Arcaro : Yes, got you. I appreciate that. That makes a lot of sense. And then maybe thinking about the PJM market broadly to appreciate your comments before and we're still waiting for this kind of supply response but there's some stakeholders that may not be as patient here. You mentioned demand response but what are you thinking there about potential major market changes or like subsidized new generation or reregulation just some of these broader approaches that have started to pick up in PGM discussions. Joseph Dominguez : Yes, I'd give you the same answer I gave you last quarter. I don't think that's realistic. I don't think it's lost on governors or stakeholders that we've had one auction and we've now delayed the second auction. We don't have final rules. We have a reference unit that was creating really this enormous variability in pricing against very few megawatts. That was the wrong decision. PJM is going to revisit that decision. They're going to do what they're going to do with the RMR units. And what I think the combination of those things is going to create is a more realistic pattern of pricing that's going to incentivize demand response and incentivize competitive supply options. So look, I know people talk about these things. They've been talking about these things for 20 years and they haven't made any significant progress on these fronts. But it's not the first time we've seen high prices result in utilities saying, \"Oh, we want to build.\" We welcome them into the water anytime they want to create emerging part of their business and invest in power plant generation. But we got to kind of let this market work and I think folks will let the market work. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Campanella of Barclays. Nick Campanella : So a lot of questions have been answered. But I think a couple of quarters ago or I think it was even in the second quarter, you talked about grid charges. This is more in the face of the protest that was filed and you argue these were in kind of like the low single digits on a dollar per megawatt hour basis. But just -- if we are shifting towards front of the meter, I'm also kind of acknowledging that every T&D operator has increased their visibility to the gigawatts that they're seeing on the grid, their queues are becoming more valuable and just -- do you see that impacting the overall front-of-the-meter charge? And how do we kind of think about how that impacts the economics and the return hurdles you're targeting? If you could just update us on what you think those front of the meter charges actually are now. Joseph Dominguez : Yes. Nick, I haven't changed my view on what they should be. I think if they're charged for when they use the grid, I think the ranges I gave you before are the -- still the same ranges. So that's -- there's nothing really that has changed that. Look, I think what's kind of misunderstood here is the -- as long as the interconnection is done efficiently, the more people you have using the transmission system, the more that cost will be broadly shared and that will be a mitigate. And that means that you have to -- that means you have to get the connection right to begin with. You can't spend a boatload of dough, locating some of these projects in places that are completely unreasonable and then trying to socialize all of those costs. That may be good for the utility but it's not good for customers. But if you locate these things very near the data centers, who are very near to the power sources on a co-located basis, you shouldn't see huge interconnection costs. And as a result, you're not going to see much higher prices than what I shared with you previously. But I think I laid this out in what you're referencing that this is not a dollar's issue. This is a speed issue. And if you listen very carefully to the tech conference the other day, that's what the data economy customers are saying. We're not saying they're not willing to pay their fair share. What they don't want to get stuck in is being mired in years of study processes. And I think some utilities are going to be able to distinguish themselves and get these things done faster than others. Nick Campanella : I appreciate those thoughts. And then just one follow-up on the capital allocation. Do you see yourself leaning on the buyback more this year now that we've moved past this Crane announcement? And then just set the table on what you're expecting to bring in the fourth quarter. Are you going to wrap in the earnings guidance to that $1.8 billion figure? And should we have kind of a wider update in the fourth quarter? Daniel Eggers : Yes, Nick. So just to give kind of our cadence now, right, as we provide a pretty comprehensive update on our financials on the fourth quarter earnings call. We'll roll forward, right, give formal '25 guidance, we'll give you the same significant inputs for '26 as we have for '25 today to give you some visibility into that multiyear view. We'll refresh the kind of the extended version of those numbers in the appendix, right? So we kind of go out to '28 now. So we'll probably add another year there. So you'll see even further horizon and keep supporting getting back to the growth rate we talk about out to 2030. On the 2-year cash available slide, yes, we'll update that for where we are closing out the year on cash and then our outlook for '25 and '26 will all go into that math. So you'll see a full new update on all those numbers and reflective of all of our CapEx plans and any growth opportunities that we haven't talked about with you guys at this point in time. On the buyback, we like you as long as we are not burdened by any material non-public information, we'll look to be in the market. We were bumped we weren't able to do it last quarter when the stock was lower and certainly, we see opportunities. So as we were allowed to, we'll be there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : I just had one question. Joe, I appreciate all the color. On the FERC decision, you shared -- you mentioned the decision being narrow. When we read through the order, there's clearly a willingness from one of the commissioners to get it right. They talk about not setting a precedent. Just do you expect FERC to start a process or some sort of a docket following the technical session on Friday or does something has to be initiated by you or your peer IPPs? Joseph Dominguez : Yes. Look, I think that's one of the things we still don't know, right? Because there's not clarity on where FERC goes but we could drive the agenda here if we're unsatisfied with progress and we know that. And so -- but we're not going to do that by ourselves. We'll do that with others better of a similar mind and we'll get that proceeding going. But want to see where PJM is going to be. We want to see where FERC is going to be -- it was -- it's one where without hearing really from these other 2 commissioners who recuse themselves on it. It's kind of hard to gauge based on the opinion because we obviously didn't see their words. So we got a little bit of work to do to understand it and we're going to be doing that this week and formulating the plan over the next couple of weeks. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Joe Dominguez for closing remarks. Sir? Joseph Dominguez : Well, listen, I appreciate all of the good questions today and the discussion. We're charging forward on all fronts, as I said. We think we have a pretty unique value proposition here with a 13% compounded growth and many, many opportunities not yet realized; and we're quite excited for the future. So, thanks again for your interest. And with that, Latif [ph], conclude the call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
