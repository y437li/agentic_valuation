As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead. Tim Driggers :  Thanks April. Good morning. I am Tim Driggers, CFO. Thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing first quarter 2014 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release in Investor Relations page on our website. Participating on the call this morning are, Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO, Gary Thomas, Chief Operating Officer, Billy Helms, Executive VP, Exploration and Production, Mario Baldwin, Vice President, IR. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening and we included second quarter and full year guidance in yesterday's press release. This morning we will discuss topics in the following order. I will first discuss our 2014 first quarter net income and discretionary cash flow, and then Bill Thomas and Billy Helms will review operational results, I\u2019ll then review EOG's financials and capital structure. Finally, Bill Thomas will cover EOG's macro view and hedge position and provide concluding remarks. As outlined in our press release, for the first quarter 2014 EOG reported net income of $661 million or $1.21 per share. EOG's first quarter 2014 adjusted non-GAAP net income which eliminates the mark-to-market impact in certain non-recurring items as outlined in the press release was $768 million or $1.40 per share. Non-GAAP discretionary cash flow for the first quarter was $2.2 billion. At March 31, 2014 the debt-to-total cap ratio was 27%. Due to a buildup of cash on the balance sheet the net debt-to-total cap ratio was 21%, down from 23% at December 31, 2013. I will now turn it over to Bill Thomas to discuss operational results and key players. Bill Thomas :  Thanks Tim. We started 2014 delivering excellent first quarter results; our total oil production was up 42% year over year. In the US oil production was up 45% sequentially. Total company production increased 18% compared with the first quarter of 2013. Based on these first quarter production result and our confidence in the remainder of the year we are raising our full year 2014 oil production growth estimate from 27% to 29% and total company, total growth estimates from 11.5% to 12%. Our actual unit cost came in lower than guidance particularly for LOE and transportation, with DD&A also at the low end. In yesterday\u2019s press release, we announced we\u2019re adding 735 high rate of return net drilling locations in the sweet spots at four plays, with estimated reserve potential of 770 million barrels of oil equivalent gross or 400 million barrels of oil equivalent net to EOG. We\u2019ve identified approximately 10 solid years of drilling inventories in these four plays. Two of these plays are in the DG basin, primarily in Laramie County Wyoming and extending into Weld County Colorado.  I\u2019ll first discuss the Codell play, this is a sandstone play that we have thoroughly defined geologically and with recent horizontal drilling results we\u2019ve identified the best acreage and are making very repeatable consistent wells. We have 72,000 net prospective acres in the sweet spot of this play in Laramie County Wyoming, where we\u2019ve identified 225 net well locations with estimated reserve potential of a 125 million barrels of oil equivalent net to EOG. Last year we drilled three net Codell wells and this year we completed four net wells, all of them have long nine thousand foot laterals and IP\u2019s in excess of 1000 barrels of oil per day. The wells average 78%, 36 degree API oil, we noted a few of these wells in our press release, this year we plan to drill 26 net wells, these wells had an expected average EUR of 695 mboe per well. Once we optimize well productivity through EOG technology and sourcing of completion materials and meet our target well cost of 7.3 million, this play should yield after-tax rates of returns greater than 100%. The second play in the DJ Basin is the Niobrara shale in Laramie County, Wyoming and Weld County, Colorado where we have 50,000 net acres in the sweet spot of this play. We have studied the Niobrara for a number of years and have found this part of the basin as quite consistent. We drilled three net wells in the Niobrara last year. The reserves are 71%, 35 degree API oil with the expected average growth EURs of 430 MBoe per well. Target well cost for our 9,000 foot lateral are $9 million due to larger fracs and yield a direct a-tax rate of return of approximately 40%. We are currently completing our first long lateral. As we've done in all our resource plays, we expect to improve well productivity and decrease well cost and improve the rates of return on this play. We see plenty of room for upside. We've identified 235 net drilling locations with estimated net reserve potential of 85 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We plan to drill a total of 39 net wells in the DJ this year, 26 in the Codell formation and 13 in the Niobrara. We are currently operating a two rig drilling program and plan to add a third rig later this month. We expect crude oil production growth from these two plays beginning this year. We also highlighted two plays in Powder River Basin. In the Powder River Parkman, we have 30,000 net prospected acres of high quality play. Last year we drilled 10 net wells and this year so far we completed six net wells. Initial production rates from shorter length laterals exceed 1,000 barrels of oil per day; and the 90 day cumulative oil production looks good. We expect results from longer laterals would be even better. With 7,300 foot lateral wells have expected average growth EURs of 850 MBoe per well of which 69% is 41 degree API oil. With 5 million completed well cost direct after-tax rate of returns exceed 100%, making the Parkman the highest rate of return play of the four discussed today. We are already seeing improved drilling times and cost savings with regard to completion materials. Estimated net potential reserves are 75 million barrels of oil equivalent. We have identified 115 net drilling locations. Much like the Niobrara, EOG has been drilling in the Turner formation for several years. So this play is not so new, but our results have improved significantly. Today, we have a much better understanding of the geology in the area and are now drilling in the best areas of the play. Through longer laterals and focused targeting our wells are improving, they are yielding higher EURs and higher oil mix. The wells we drilled in 2011 had 26% oil mix versus 34% today. Last year, we drilled eight net wells; the lateral lengths in the Turner will vary from 4,600 to 9,000 feet. The average gross EUR for an 8,200 foot lateral is 860 MBoe per well. The returns here average 100% direct after-tax with a 7.5 million completed well cost. The estimated potential reserves are 115 million barrels of oil equivalent, net on our 63,000 net acres in the Turner. We have identified 160 net drilling locations. Running a two rig program, we plan to drill a total of 34 net wells in the Powder River this year; 28 in the Parkman formations and six in the Turner. Regarding explorations, we continue to actively search for additional new plays. As we\u2019ve previously mentioned, our new discovery the size of our estimated 3.2 billion barrels equivalent net Eagle Ford potential reserves would be difficult to repeat. However, the plays announced in yesterday's press release are significant and three of the four plays are oil plays with very strong direct a-tax rate of return. We are currently completing our first long lateral in the Niobrara and are optimistic on the overall economics of this play. We plan to continue to add these types of high rate of return bolt-on oil plays to our portfolio. We\u2019ve set a high threshold at EOG with plays like the Eagle Ford, Bakken, and Leonard. Other plays that compete for capital require the same rate of return metrics. The plays we\u2019ve announced today are certainly in that category. In the Eagle Ford, we\u2019ve increased activity compared to last year. We\u2019re on track to drill 520 net wells this year. We're currently running 26 rigs in the play and the Eagle Ford was the biggest contributor to our first quarter oil growth and the reason we exceeded our first quarter oil production guidance. We continue to make improvements in well productivity and as our press release cited, a number of recent Eagle Ford wells have IP rates in excess of 4,000 barrels of oil per day. The Eagle Ford continues to be our largest growth asset with the highest after-tax rates of return. By mid-year, the vast majority of our drilling obligations for 2014 to hold our 564,000 net acreage position in the crude oil window will be essentially complete, giving us much more flexibility to efficiently manage our drilling and production operations. We modeled our Eagle Ford production for the next 10 years. If we increase this year's 520 net wells by a modest amount and hold that number flat through 2024, our Eagle Ford oil volumes increase every year. The Eagle Ford will draw a free cash flow this year and every year through 2024. In our model, we haven't assumed any improvements in well productivity or well cost. We've maintained the status quo. We\u2019ve talked about the 6,000 net remaining locations on our acreage. We used a 60% direct after-tax rate of return cut off point in moving these locations into our inventory. We still have a large number of locations that don't meet this threshold, but we continue to improve, make improvements in well productivity and economics, and are working to move these locations into our drilling inventory. I'll now turn it over to Billy Helms to discuss other areas. Billy Helms : Thanks Bill. Last year we increased the drilling density in the Bakken from two to four wells per spacing unit. Due to higher tighter spacing and configuration of leases, the majority of our 2013 drilling in the Core and Antelope Extension was based on 1,300 feet between wells. The successful 1,300 foot spacing across our acreage, we are now testing 700 feet and tighter spacing between wells in the Core and Antelope Extension areas. Hoping to repeat what EOG achieved in the Eagle Ford, we will continually test downspacing until we've maximized the net present value in the overall play. We are early in the life of these tests and we will monitor production history to determine optimal spacing for development. If tighter spacing proves successful, a number of years would be added to our Bakken drilling inventory. The majority of our 2014 development program is in the Core area, where we already have pad drilling and completion infrastructure. We are currently operating six rigs in the Williston Basin with plans to add a seventh this summer. During the first quarter, we completed a number of wells on our Core acreage, the Wayzetta 28-1424H, 29-1424H and 38-1424H were completed at initial oil rates of 1,060, 1,295 and 1,000 barrels of oil per day with 105, 125 and 100 barrels per day of NGLs, respectively. These wells were drilled off the same pad. Less than 2,000 feet from these wells, the Wayzetta 39-1424H and 40-1424H, were completed at 1,760 and 2,220 barrels of oil per day with 170 and 215 barrels per day of NGLs respectively. In the Permian, our 2014 activity is focused in the Delaware Basin, where we've more than doubled the number of wells we plan to drill this year compared to last year's total. In the Leonard Shale, we continue to test various spacing patterns across our acreage to determine the optimal development program. Recent test were drilled with 660 feet or 80 acres and 430 feet spacing, 60 acres between the wells. The Dillon 31 number 1H, number 2H and number 3H were drilled with 430 feet between wells. This is our most dense, same zone spacing test to-date. The wells came online with 1,225, 1,395 and 1,315 barrels of oil per day respectively. Based on these successful results, we plan to test tighter spacing both between wells and across zones throughout our 73,000 net acre position. We are currently testing 32 acre spacing across different zones. Through an active development program, we continue to better define our acreage. In the Delaware Wolfcamp, we drilled eight wells this year. The wells produced a lower initially oil rate than the Leonard but had a very flat production profile, which generates a very strong after-tax rate of return. To-date, we have tested three liquids-rich zones within the Delaware Basin Wolfcamp, and are testing various spacing patterns as tight as 50 acres between wells as we develop these zones. We're seeing improved well productivity in both the Leonard and Wolfcamp plays. Because we've now moved into development mode, our drilling operations are more efficient resulting in decreased drilling days and cost. We're currently operating a four rig program in the basin. Completion costs have also decreased with the integration of EOGs sourced sand and other materials. Further enhancements in our geoscience and completions work continue to improve our two Delaware Basin plays, and we are confident. We realize ongoing improvements and additional success in the Basin. In Trinidad, we have a three well development drilling program planned for 2014, which will allow us to maintain flat natural gas production in later years. In the East Irish Sea, the Conwy prospect is still expected to be online in late 2014. I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure. Tim Driggers : Thanks, Billy. For the first quarter, capitalized interest was $14.2 million. Total cash expiration and development expenditures were $1.8 billion, excluding asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $166 million. EOG made $4 million of acquisitions during the quarter. During the first quarter, net cash provided by operating activities exceeded financing and investing cash outflows. At the end of March, total debt outstanding was $5.9 billion. At March 31, we had $1.7 billion of cash on hand. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 36% and the deferred tax-rate ratio was 63%. Yesterday, we included guidance table with the earnings press release for the second quarter and full year 2014. For the second quarter and full year, the effective tax rate is estimated to be 35% to 40%. We have also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the second quarter and for the full year. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill to provide EOG's views regarding the macro-environment hedging and operations. Bill Thomas : Thanks Tim. With regards to oil, we believe we are in a continued tight supply demand situation globally. Last year, the U.S. was the largest oil growth area in the world. However, the rate of oil growth in the U.S. is beginning to slow and 2014 non-OPEC supplies have been revised downward while global demand for oil from non-OECD countries continues to increase. Therefore, we expect to see strong oil processed for the remainder of this year barring a global recession. Regarding North America gas, taking into account current store levels and assuming normal weather, we expect prices to remain stable in the $4.50 to $5 range due to summer of 2014. This is with a caveat that E&P companies stay disciplined at these gas prices and don't ramp up drilling activity. Once we enter the storage withdrawal season, we expect to see upward pressure on gas prices. Late next year, the first LNG plant at Sabine Pass is scheduled to begin exporting natural gas. This could signal the beginning of a structural change in natural gas demand. In 2016, a number of new petrochemical plants utilizing natural gas feedstock are expected to be commissioned, the remainder of the LNG commission plants are scheduled for start-up in \u201818. For May 2014, EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 181,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of 96.55 per barrel. For June 2014, EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 171,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of 96.35 per barrel. For the period July 1 through December 31, 2014, EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 74,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of 95.37 per barrel. These numbers exclude options that are exercisable by our counterparties. For the period June 1 through December 31, 2014, EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 330,000 million British thermal units per day at a weighted average price of 4.55 per million British thermal units. For the period January 1 through December 31, 2015, EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 175,000 MMBtu per day at a weighted average price of $4.51 per MMBtu. These numbers exclude options that are exercisable by our counterparties. As it relates to EOG and the overall macro environment, EOG's marketing and midstream investments again prove invaluable in the first quarter. In the U.S., EOG realizations average $1.97 over West Texas Intermediate index process. However, we continue to sell the majority of our oil index of LLS pricing.  Now let me conclude, there are five important takeaways from this call. First, EOG continues to demonstrate its ability to organically grow. Yesterday, we announced the addition of 735 high rate of return net drilling locations with 10 years of drilling inventory from the sweet spots of four high quality, high oil content onshore U.S. plays. This is proof of our very disciplined approach to adding new plays. First, we identify the potential. Second, we capture the acreage. Third, we apply technology to the play until results meet our rate of return criteria. What's significant is that these are predominantly oil plays that compares favorably with our current highest rate of return plays. Our goal is to increase EOG's ROE and ROCE and by adding these higher rate of return plays we are doing so. Second, we increased our oil production growth target for the year from 27% to 29%. We've said all along that EOG has the best horizontal crude oil assets in the U.S. and they continue to deliver. Third, the Eagle Ford continues to demonstrate improvements in well productivity from ongoing refinements and completion techniques. In modeling production from the Eagle Ford we are on a growth track for the next 10 years and I want to repeat in modeling production from the Eagle Ford, we are on a growth track for the next 10 years before we even begin to see production level out. Fourth, we are testing additional downspacing patterns in the Bakken, Leonard, and Wolfcamp plays. We will continue to test downspacing until we\u2019ve reached maximum optimization for each of these plays. To wrap it up, EOG turned in another outstanding quarter. Our U.S. oil plays continue to deliver. We continue to make improvements and completions even in our most mature plays, the Eagle Ford and Bakken. EOG is running like a finely tuned high performance engine. Thanks for listening and now we\u2019ll go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you, (Operator Instructions), and we\u2019ll first hear from Doug Leggate at Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning everybody, I love the pronunciation on these calls, but thanks for all the color Bill on the new plays, I guess my question is on Slide 9 in your presentation. You show how they stack up on a relative basis with the IRR. So I guess what I\u2019m really trying to understand is, how should we think about capital allocation here as we go forward, as you grow your cash flow? And specifically, I wonder if you could address the 60% threshold in the Eagle Ford that you haven't included in your inventory. What's it going to take to get those into a competitive position and how will that theoretically change your capital allocation? Then I've got a follow-up, please. Bill Thomas : Yes, Doug, yes, on the capital allocation, as we go forward, we've given guidance in the past and we want to reiterate this, at number one, the first priority is to the dividend, and we want to continue our 15-year history of a healthy dividend increase. Next, the focus is on reinvesting that capital back into the highest rate of return plays, and now, we have more of those to offer up.  And first, certainly the Eagle Ford is the highest rate of return play we have, and so the biggest amount of capital will go to that. The Bakken Three Forks next, the Leonard, the Delaware Basin, Leonard and now we have opportunities to reinvest at high returns in the DJ Codell, the Parkman and Turner play. So that's where we will focus our capital as we go forward. On the Eagle Ford and the remaining inventory that we haven't included because it has not made our 60% a-tax rate of return cutoff, we are focused on that and we have a pretty -- could be a pretty significant number of wells that we can drill and we're doing like we do on all of our plays, we're working on the cost to reduce the cost as we go forward. I think most importantly, we continue to see improvements in the well completions, in the frac technology, and so, we're hopeful that we go forward that those wells will get those returns up into the -- above 60% and down the road, as the years go down the road, we\u2019ll be able to include those in our inventory. So, the reason we haven't listed those really right now is part of our 7,200 well locations is we're just not really focused on those. We're not drilling a lot of those right now, so we just didn't include them. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : My follow-up hopefully is quite quick. I assume by the fact that you've revealed these four additional plays that you're done leasing, and I'm just curious as to -- do you have any additional opportunities to expand your position or have you moved on from those now in terms of new acreage, and I'll leave it there? Bill Thomas : Yeah, on the new plays, I don\u2019t think -- we wouldn't talk about them unless we had felt like that we captured the sweet spots. We did a very thorough geological evaluation and we have a lot of data, and we have really narrowed down the acreage to the, what we believe are the highest return areas of the play. So, the acreage numbers listed for each play are really the sweet spots where we think we'd have the best chance to make the best wells. And so we think we've captured that and there is probably additional zones or probably additional areas that would be productive, but we're really focused on the sweet spots and we have those captured. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Appreciate the answers, thanks Bill. Operator : Next we\u2019ll hear from Leo Mariani of RBC. Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets : Hey guys, you made some interesting comments about the Eagle Ford here. Wanted to delve a bit more into your comment about holding the Eagle Ford by production by mid-2014; once you guys are able to achieve that, what type of efficiency gains do you think you'll be able to capture through the drilling program. Maybe you can kind of speak to how you might manage development differently post that. Bill Thomas : Yeah, Leo, in the first quarter and then some in the second quarter, we drilled a lot of retention wells that means it's kind of the first wells on a unit to hold that acreage. And as we have completed that process, as we complete that process, it gives us the flexibility to go back in and really focus on each unit and begin to pad drill, drill those on pads, multiple wells on pads, and again, optimize our costs and then to focus on making the better wells and getting the spacing right and the completions right. And just able to, I think, have more efficiency and perform better as we go forward. Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets :  Any kind of sort of big picture or quantification could we see 5% to 10% efficiency gain as a result over the next few years? Bill Thomas :  Yeah, Leo, I'm going to let Gary Thomas address that question. Gary Thomas : Yes, Leo, with this now having the majority of our acreage, HBP here second half and ongoing, not having to spend money on roads, location quite so much. Also, the facilities gathering, all of that will be much reduced. It just improves our overall operations. We've drilled some of these wells in as little as 5.3 days, so our days per well will continue to decline with pad drilling. So we'll see certainly the 5% to 10% cost reduction. Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets :  Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess just quickly on the DJ Basin here, you obviously talked about some sweet spots. I guess historically, there has been a decent amount of variability in parts of the DJ in both the Codell and the Niobrara. I guess you kind of laid out some of the wells that you guys have drilled here. What are you guys using for well controls in your programs, are there other industry wells out there and other data that you\u2019re seeing that convinces you that the acreage position you\u2019ve laid out are not all that variable at this point? Bill Thomas : Yes Leo, we are quite a bit of sub-surfaced well data. With this about 130 wells that are located near our acreage or on our acreage that have defined these sweet spots in the Codell, and in the Niobrara also. And so we believe, you\u2019re correct. The DJ Basin historically has been very variable, so there are sweet spots that really kind of set up by the basin architecture and it varies. We really believe with our good results that we\u2019ve had from the drilling in this area and with our geologic mapping that that we have a spot -- sweet spot that will give us very consistent results. So that's why we\u2019re focused on these areas. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs : Wanted to try to jack that up a little some of the macro comments you made, with just how you're thinking about your investment and growth at the EOG level. Maybe I\u2019ll start with gas here first. The outlook you delivered, I felt like, is a little more bullish on natural gas than what you\u2019ve delivered previously. Obviously weather has probably played a role in that. You highlighted that it is contingent on producers been disciplined. Given your free cash flow and the gas, the acreage you identify on one of your slides, how does EOG stay disciplined and what would it take if anything to allocate some capital to gas, not necessarily taking out of oil but just allocating more capital to gas? Bill Thomas : Yes, Brian, I think we're mildly bullish on near-term gas that we think it will be in $4.50 to $5 range, and we are really not prepared and we really don't want to invest any additional money at this time in any dry gas drilling. The reason is because we want to really see what the long-term gas price is going to do, and that's going to depend a lot on what operators do at $4.50 and $5 gas prices. There's so much gas potential out there that it could easily drill a lot of wells and the price of gas would decrease. So, we really want to wait and be patient on that. You're right, we have tremendous amounts of very high quality gas assets, and we really would need $5.50 or a better price, and we would need to believe that that $5.50 or better price would hang in there for multiple years before we'd even think about drilling dry gas. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs : Got it, thanks and my follow-up is going to oil, big picture, you highlighted you're accelerating oil production per year on a barrel a day basis. I think it\u2019s Slide 14 of your presentation, the midpoint of this year's guidance is about 64,000 barrels a day of growth. If we exclude the impact of the Conwy project, do you expect that this level will continue to accelerate in future years, and how does that juxtapose with your macro, your more optimistic macro view in terms of US light oil prices. Bill Thomas : Well, we remain bullish on light oil prices. Certainly as we talked about from the macro view, we continue to see a tight supply worldwide and we do not see any pending crisis on overloading the system, the U.S. system, the refinery system to be able to process all that oil. So our focus is going to be to reinvest back into the highest return plays and the highest return plays, we fully believe in the next few years will be our oil plays. We will continue to -- as they prove up and continue to give us high rate returns, we will continue to add capital back into those. Of course, the focus will be Eagle Ford, Bakken, but now we have a good set of plays that we have a lot of opportunity to reinvest in. So our focus is going to be oil for quite some time. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs : I mean you likely won't need 64,000 barrels a day of oil growth per year to have above peer average type growth, but do you see that 64,000 rising in terms \u2013 as a rate of growth. Bill Thomas : I wouldn't say it would rise, but we think it will be fairly consistent. Operator :  Next we\u2019ll hear from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Charles Meade - Johnson Rice : Yes, good morning thanks for taking my question, Bill, when you were talking about those four new plays, you talked about applying technology to the plays. I can think of at least three things that might mean, it might be the D&C cost, it could be high-grading the acreage and locations and it could be improvement of completion designs and associated well productivity. Can you give a sense for at least maybe the newer plays, the Codell and perhaps the Parkman? What progress have you made that brought those into the portfolio? What do you think the opportunity is going to be for continued improvement on those dimensions going forward? Bill Thomas : Yes Charles, that\u2019s a good question, it starts with the sweet spot, so we drilled quite a few Parkman wells and with that data and the other geologic data available, we've really narrowed down this acreage in the Parkman to the very sweetest spot. So we're focused on best play, that \u2013 it is a start. Then we brought in the completion technology as we've learned on all these horizontal plays and shale plays, the completion technology continues to advance. We're now seeing even in the conventional \u2013 more conventional rocks like sandstones that the improvements that we've seen in the shale plays also apply to those two. So the completion process I think has allowed us to increase the initial production on the rate, on the rates on the wells and the reserve potential on the wells. That along with the EOG been able to come in and apply our kind of shale cost reduction efforts in these plays, to reduce the overall cost, it's really improved the rates of returns on all these plays. So it's a threefold thing really and it really fits into EOG strength. Charles Meade - Johnson Rice : Got it, and then if I could go back and try one more time on the Eagle Ford inventory question, is this \u2013 the inventory that that's not in your number right now, is this in the oily window where perhaps the reservoir is not as productive or is this down dip in gassier acreage that maybe comes into the inventory when gas is it at 4.50 or 5 bucks. Bill Thomas : Charles, no, it\u2019s all in the oil window. And it\u2019s in the areas where we may have a bit more geologic geo hazards. All thing and things like that. And it takes a little bit better effort on our part to get frac containment, and we have to change maybe the direction of the wells drilled in and we also have to work a bit harder at getting the frac more evenly distributed along the lateral. So, it's all oil and we have confidence as we go forward that we\u2019re going to be able to continue to make improvements in those areas. Operator : And next we\u2019ll hear from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors : Good morning Bill. I liked your comments on your 10 years of growth in the Eagle Ford. Given that you model back, can you about how many years of growth do you see in the Bakken? Bill Thomas : David, we have not done that extensive model in the Bakken yet, because we\u2019re really in the initial stages of downspacing, and I want to ask Billy Helms to make some comments on that. Billy Helms : Yeah, David, for our Bakken as we illustrated, we\u2019re still very satisfied, very pleased with our 1,300 foot spacing test. But we realized that our NPV, net present value, was not maximized. So, we\u2019re going to be doing lots of additional testing, we did talk about 700 foot spacing pattern and we\u2019ll be testing some various spacing patterns as we try to define how to maximize net present value. This is a similar approach as we've done in most of our shale plays across the company. and until we really find out what that formula looks like, we're really kind of hesitant to state what the upside not be there, but certainly we will provide some more effort on that as we go forward the year, and we're very confident that we're going to have success there. David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors : On the maximizing NPV, one of the things we've talked a lot about is your IRR doesn't change much, but your EUR may decline per well as NPV goes up. Is that a fair characterization of how your downspacing could actually roll forward? Bill Thomas : Yes, that's correct. Naturally, as you push wells closer together, you're going to end up having some sharing between wells. That's just inevitable. Our rate of return is still very, very high as you stated, but what we end up doing is adding a lot more recoverable reserves, and there is a lot more net present value to each spacing unit that we drill. So, that's kind of our overall process. And we're still early on in the space, certainly in the Bakken as we try to define that. David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors : And just If I may, one more follow-up on -- as you talked about NGLs, kind of 2016 plus. How does your significant combo play exposure factor into like your out-year plan and then we've seen -- we think we've seen a floor for NGL prices due to supply demand in exports, would you agree with that as you start thinking '15, '16 plus? Bill Thomas : Yeah, David, I think NGLs kind of go along with the gas, and we are hopeful that the NGL demand will increase enough to firm up the price. But again, I think from a capital standpoint, we still are very focused on oil and really oil for the next several years is going to be where we're going to think we're going to get the highest return. So as we can get better NGL prices and gas price, both combo plays, we'll become competitive with our oil plays down the road and we'll put capital on those. But near term, we're still focused on oil. Operator : Irene Haas, Wunderlich Securities has our next question. Irene Haas - Wunderlich Securities :  Hello everybody. You guys have been super quiet and super stealth about these Rocky Mountain plays, and congratulations to your new drilling inventory in Wyoming and Colorado. And my question for you is really has to do with the Powder River Basin. Can you help me with the 35,000 net acres, so just one layer or is it two, do they overlap? And then really parallel to this is, can we have some color on the geology, are these really -- real continuous play or you just have nailed the sweet spot, and lastly sort of transportation differential things of that nature to ship the oil out of Powder River Basin? Bill Thomas : Yeah Irene, the Parkman is about 30,000 acres in the sweet spot, net sweet spot and then the Turner is about 63,000 net acres in the sweet spot, and much of that acreage does overlap, but not all of it, and each of those are both sandstone plays. And so we have quite a bit of surface data, and we've mapped the thickest parts of those sandstones and the most productive parts of it. So that's what those two acreage numbers take in consideration and those obviously we're going to make the highest return of oil in each one of those. Let me ask Gary Thomas to answer your question on takeaway for the Powder. Gary Thomas : We've been really pleased with the various midstream companies. We're working with several and we're looking at \u2013 they're looking at booking in crude line that would come down from North Dakota through Wyoming to be able to pick up our DJ and our Powder River oil. There's also processing in place and companies that are interested in, yes, the expansion as well as put in new processing facilities. So, it\u2019s looking very favorable. Operator :  Our next question comes from Pearce Hammond, Simmons & Co. Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company: Can you remind us the net resource potential or reserve potential for the Eagle Ford, when you first announced that play? Do you see the same thing unfolding with these new plays in the DJ and PRB? Bill Thomas : Yes Pearce, the first number, I mean, the first one come out, it was 900 million barrels equivalent net to EOG and I would say the plays, the four plays that we've announced today, they do not have that upside potential. Obviously, we had 564,000 acres in the Eagle Ford and it\u2019s a very continuous shale play. These plays in particular the Codell, the Turner, and the Parkman are sandstone plays. They're not really shale plays. So they are more defined geologically and really the acreage positions that we've outlined in each one of those is really the sweet spot and probably the best extents of those plays. On the Niobrara, of course it is a shale play, but again, we really think we\u2019ve identified a sweet spot in that 50,000 acres there, and we believe that we\u2019ll get consistent results there. Outside of that acreage that's not really proven to be consistent yet, so we'll just have to see as time goes on where we can maybe expand that, but right now we\u2019re really focused on these individual sweet spots. I would say in the Niobrara, there are multiple targets there and the reserves that we\u2019ve given in this guidance is just assuming one target and it\u2019s assuming six wells per section. So, there is downspacing potential, additional targets in the Niobrara and then in the other plays there could be some downspacing potential there, but that's undefined yet. We\u2019re just hopeful on all that. We\u2019ll have to test that as we go along and if that becomes clear we\u2019ll certainly talk about it. Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company: And then my follow-up is, how do you see service costs right now kind of across the \u2013 all your positions, are you experiencing any tightness, any service cost inflation? Bill Thomas :  Pearce, we\u2019re not seeing much, we\u2019re seeing tightening on our drilling rigs. They\u2019ve probably gone up in some areas as much as 5%, but as you know EOG has got so much of our services locked in and self-sourced that we\u2019re not seeing any pressure otherwise. There is a little bit on just trucking, but that\u2019s why we\u2019re putting in our gathering system et cetera, just because these are going to be so long-lived properties, just to hold future costs down. Operator : Next we\u2019ll hear from David Tameron of Wells Fargo. David Tameron - Wells Fargo : Hi, just a couple of questions, and I think you've addressed this partially, but could you talk about your desire to ramp and your production (will flow) faster, one additional way to bring NPV forward. So can you talk, address that as \u2013 I know you are at the upper end of your large cap here. So just address that, and then I'll have a follow-up on the Powder. Bill Thomas : We're continuing to drill more wells, it's efficiencies in large part. And thinking of the Eagle Ford, yes, we're going to be drilling more wells this year than last, but with the same number of rigs. So we can say that's just continuing to improve our efficiencies and drilling more wells each year without a large addition of capital, even though we plan to spend additional capital on drilling and completion our E&P sector, future years. Tim Driggers : Yes David, I'll kind of add to that. The Company is not so much focused on production growth. We're really focused on capital return, and that is what drives EOG. We're not interested in drilling low return wells to grow production. So we're going to very much stay focused and very much stay disciplined in our CapEx plans. So the plays have to have a very strong rate of return before we're going to spend money on them. David Tameron - Wells Fargo : Okay and then just, okay, that\u2019s helpful and then thinking about the Powder, we've done obviously a lot of work on the play and just one thing that's always been a hiccup for people is kind of the gas processing or it seems to be at least the Powder, it has been a, I guess, maybe a more of a hurdle as a better way to approach that. Is that what you guys are running into? And if so, are there plans to address. I heard you talk about infrastructures specifically, is it more on the processing gas side or is it more crude takeaway. I assume those -- I know those are some rail projects out there et cetera. But can you just give us a little better snapshot on infrastructure? Bill Thomas : We're working on the crude pipeline takeaway there. We believe that's going to be in place soon enough for us. As far the gas processing, that's probably the larger concern, but there is plant expansions in place. So we've got sufficient takeaway at this point and we think that it's going to keep us with our growth in the area. David Tameron - Wells Fargo : Okay. I\u2019ll let follow somebody else jump in, appreciate it. Operator : Next we\u2019ll hear from Amir Arif of Stifel Nicolaus. Amir Arif - Stifel Nicolaus : On the DJ Basin, have you -- I know you mentioned in the EUR estimates only one time, but can you let us know if you've tested the different benches of the Codell and relative and similarly the Niobrara in the Laramie County? Bill Thomas : Yeah Amir, on the Codell, you just have one target there and we've had good number of wells that we've talked about that we've drilled in that, so we feel great about that. On the DJ, in this area that we're focused on the sweet spot, we drilled one target so far, and it's been in the lower part of the Niobrara and that's the target we feel like will give us very very consistent results. We do have plans later in the year to drill a couple of patterns. The first pattern will be with four Niobrara wells in the lower target and three Codell wells and that's a seven well pattern. Then the second pattern later in the year, we're going to drill six Niobrara wells with three in the upper target and three in the lower target and then three Codell wells, so that's a nine well pattern. So as we drill those and learn how to continue to improve the completions and get into this pattern of drilling, we'll learn a whole lot more about the different targets benches in the Niobrara. And then also the Codell and how all those kind of relate with each other. Amir Arif - Stifel Nicolaus : Okay, thanks for the color. And then the follow-up question is, just looking at the four new plays, I mean, great returns, great projects to add, but given that the size of 30,000 to 70,000 acres relative to your other plays. Can you just provide some color or comments in terms of the minimum acreage threshold you're looking at when you get into new plays and even some color in terms of where you think we are as an industry in terms of the resource capture and is that part of the reason why you sort of look at smaller acreage plays. Bill Thomas : Yeah. I think we've learned off the plays, all these resource plays, that really to make the highest returns you really need to focus in the sweet spots and they're variable in size. Obviously, in the sandstone plays and that we talked about, they're a bit smaller. In the shale plays, they can be bigger, but in the case of the DJ basin, the basin has shown quite a bit of variability in the Niobrara there, so you have to be really careful. So that's why we've focused in only the 50,000 acres so far in the Niobrara there. But as far as additional play potential in the U.S., we do see opportunities and as we\u2019ve said before, we have plays that we\u2019re working on in different stages of identification and testing. And so we believe that it's going to be very difficult to find another Eagle Ford that have both the size and the quality, and another Bakken, which would have the size and quality. But we do believe that there will be additional plays that we can capture sweet spots on that will be additive to EOG\u2019s inventory and that will be significant enough for us to focus on. So, when you have multiple hundreds of wells, that\u2019s a nice play size and certainly a kind of thing we want to capture. Operator : And next we\u2019ll hear from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett - Bernstein Research : Pretty morning, got a bit of a two part question I noticed you\u2019re carrying fairly wide spacing lifts in these new sandstone lithologies, is that because you think the footprints or the drainage areas are larger? Bill Thomas : Bob, they do have -- they\u2019re better reservoirs so they have better probability. But I think that's to be determined. We will certainly be evaluating the wells as we get them on these spacings and the frac patterns and the potential interference between the wells. And there could be some room for additional downspacing in the place as we go forward. It\u2019s just typically EOG, we\u2019re very conservative on our reserve estimates when we start these plays out, but that will be our focus is to maximize the NPV, and that's one way to do it is through additional downspacing. Bob Brackett - Bernstein Research : And as a follow-up, if I think about going back as far as say the Jake well, what's your strategy for either avoiding or embracing natural fracture systems out there in the front-range? Tim Driggers : Yes, Bob that\u2019s a good question, the Jake well was really targeted in a different part of the Niobrara than we're focused on right now, more of in the \u2013 what they call the chalk part, we call it the b chalk in the upper part of the Niobrara, and it's also, was very fracture driven. So, we have done extensive mapping on the Niobrara and this lower target, we believe will give us more consistency, number one, and then we also have 3D to identify the fracturing and identifying the faulting. Then I think the third thing is our completion technology has advanced quite a bit and those early wells we drilled were very small fracs with different completion styles. So we're going to be using our latest completion techniques and we think that will be beneficial also. Bob Brackett - Bernstein Research :  But would you be targeting areas that are highly naturally fractured or you\u2019d avoid those? Tim Driggers : I think we want to really avoid those. There's always fracturing that's involved in these plays, but really looking for resource play that would be consistent, or we can get excellent matrix contribution. So that's the approach that we're taking. Operator : And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session for today. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Thomas for any additional or closing comments. Bill Thomas : Thank you for listening. We appreciate all the questions. That's it. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation.",

Bernstein  Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs  Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the EOG Resources Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, Sir. Tim Driggers : Good morning. I am Tim Driggers, CFO. Thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing second quarter 2014 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page on our website. Participating on the call this morning are, Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO, Gary Thomas, Chief Operating Officer, Billy Helms, Executive VP, Exploration and Production, and Mario Baldwin, Vice President, IR. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening and we included third quarter and full year guidance in yesterday's press release. This morning we will discuss topics in the following order. I will first review our 2014 second quarter net income and discretionary cash flow, and then Bill Thomas and Billy Helms will provide operational results, I\u2019ll then address EOG's financials, capital structure and hedge position. Finally, Bill Thomas will cover EOG's macro view and provide concluding remarks. As outlined in our press release, for the second quarter 2014, EOG reported net income of $706.4 million or $1.29 per share. EOG's second quarter 2014 adjusted non-GAAP net income which eliminates the mark-to-market impacts and certain non-recurring items as outlined in the press release was $796 million or $1.45 per share. Non-GAAP discretionary cash flow for the second quarter was $2.2 billion. At June 30, 2014 the debt-to-total cap ratio was 26%. The net debt-to-total cap ratio was 22%. I will now turn it over to Bill Thomas to discuss operational results and key plays. Bill Thomas : Thanks,Tim. Once again EOG had an outstanding quarter. We posted year-over-year U.S. oil growth of 33% with total company production growth of 17%, which drove excellent financial metrics. We increased the dividend on the common stock by 34%, the second increase this year, and we also announced our success in yet another high return US crude oil play.  EOG\u2019s workhouse assets, the Eagle Ford and Bakken continued to meet or in most cases exceed our high expectations. Although we\u2019ve been in the Bakken since 2006 and the Eagle Ford since 2010 we are steadily improving individual well results in both plays through continuing advances in completion designs.  Also due to our ongoing ability to improve efficiencies, we continued to maintain good cost control, which was evident in our second quarter results. Together these plays are continuing to drive high return oil growth and are far from mature. We realized cost reductions during the first half partially due to efficiency gains from the increase in pad drilling in the Bakken and Eagle Ford. In both plays we are drilling longer laterals and utilizing larger fracs because we have secured sand supplies. With pad completions, a large number of offset wells are taken off-line. Wells take longer to flow back and new wells are brought on production and packages. As a result, production growth can be lumpy rather than linear. As many of you who follow state data have noticed. This doesn't change EOG\u2019s long-term growth profile. As mentioned in yesterday's press release, we announced success of the second Bone Spring Sand which lies beneath our Leonard shale acreage in the Delaware Basin. This is the fifth oil or combo plate EOG has added to its drilling inventory this year. Now I will turn it over to Billy Helms to discuss this play and our operations. Billy Helms : Thanks Bill. In the first half of 2014, we were in the exploratory phase on our Delaware basin Leonard acreage. As we mentioned on our May call we were testing various spacing pilots and zones across our acreage. We also tested the potential of the Second Bone Spring Sand. The second Bone Spring Sand sits beneath our Leonard acreage position primarily in Eddy and Lea counties, New Mexico. We drilled our first horizontal wells here 10 years ago and shifted capital to the Leonard and Wolfcamp shale plays and now we\u2019ve gone back to our proprietary completion techniques.  In Southern Lea County we drilled and completed two very successful wells in the Second Bone Springs Sand. The first was a short link lateral and the second was drilled with 4500 foot lateral. The Mars 3 State #1H and the Jolly Roger 16 Sate #1H had initial production rates of 1270 and 1450 barrels of oil per day with 150 and 210 barrels per day of NGLs and 1.1 million and 1.5 million cubic feet per day of natural gas respectively. The production stream is 70%, 45 API gravity oil. We have 73,000 net Leonard acres and estimate the second Bone Spring Sand is highly perspective over the majority of this acreage. We still need additional drilling to test all portions of our acreage, but these initial results combined with the industry data from over 500 wells rate our expectation for the play\u2019s high rate return growth potential. The estimate completed well cost of $6 million with gross reserves of 500 in BOE per well yielding 100% direct after-tax rate of return.  We are very pleased with the addition of the second Bone Spring Sand to our drilling portfolio. It\u2019s a high rate of return black oil play on existing acreage. We plan to drill a few more wells this year and increase activity in the play in 2015. Over time we will determine proper spacing and the ultimate resource potential to EOG. In the Leonard shale, we are still testing down spacing in the same zones and across zones. Over the last 12 months we tested numerous patterns from 660 foot spacing down to the 300 foot space Gemini wells highlighted in the press release. We are very pleased with the preliminary production results. We've also had initial results from two recent B-zone wells and from tightly spaced wells drilled in a pattern across the A and B zones. It is a little too early to reach firm conclusions on optimum spacing or the ultimate number of possible well locations from each zone. But we are encouraged by our results today. In the Delaware Basin Wolfcamp, we\u2019re focused on making improvements in well productivity through the application of completion technology. In Reeves County, the State Apache 57, #11 07H was completed with an initial production rate of 1600 barrels of oil per day with 460 barrels per day of NGLs and 3 million ft.\u00b3 per day of natural gas. This is the best Wolfcamp well we drilled to date. We are testing various spacing patterns and the prospectivity of different pay intervals in the play. We are on track to complete 14 net wells this year and have been encouraged with our progress and results to date.  In the Bakken, we've shifted to more multi-well pad drilling this year with most of our activity focused in the core area. We\u2019re encouraged by the very early production flow back results from our first 700 foot spaced wells. As Bill mentioned earlier these are wells -- these are wells drilled from pads and completed with larger fracs. The wells are taking longer to flow back and therefore it is too early to report any individual well results. We've noticed a marked improvement in production rates that reflect changes we\u2019ve made to completion techniques over the last two years. After achieving peak rates, the well production is flattening out nicely, delivering excellent rate of return. During the second half, we plan to drill both Bakken and Three Forks wells on our Antelope Extension acreage. We also plan to test various benches of the Three Forks formation on both our core and Antelope extension acreage. Later this year we expect to get our first data point after we test the third bench of the Three Forks on our Antelope extension acreage. In the Wyoming DJ basin we plan to drill 39 net wells this year in the Codell and Niobrara. One notable new well completed in the second quarter in the Codell was the Jubilee 586 \u2013 1705H. It came online in 1145 barrels of oil per day with 445 MCF per day of rich natural gas. We have a 75% working interest in the well. Since May we've added 13,000 net acres in the Codell, increasing our position to 85,000 net acres. In the Powder River Basin, we plan to drill 34 net wells this year in the Parkman and Turner reservoirs. Two recently completed Parkman wells are the Mary\u2019s Draw 404-21H and 468 \u2013 34H which had initial production rates of 1045 and 980 barrels of oil per day respectively. We have 99% and 100% working interest in the wells respectively and we are drilling on multi-well pads in both the Powder River and DJ. I'll now turn it over to Bill to discuss the Eagle Ford and our international operations. Bill Thomas : Thanks Billy. In the Eagle Ford, we\u2019re in the sixth inning of understanding and progress in the play and we\u2019ve not yet reached the peak from a learning curve standpoint. We\u2019re constantly experimenting with the completion designs and are seeing improved production responses from these tweaks. We still have ongoing spacing pilots in certain areas. We highlighted multiple high initial production rate wells in our press release.  During the second quarter of the 29 wells we drilled in Gonzales County, 21 had IP rates exceeding 2500 barrels of oil per day. This distinct statement shows our Eagle Ford quality is holding up quite nicely. During the second quarter we drilled a number of lease retention wells. Our drilling plans for the second half include fewer of these one-off wells that we expect to realize efficiency gains from pad drilling and other improvements in costs and logistics. We are drilling longer laterals with a 50% increase in the number of stages from where we were three years ago. We\u2019re also seeing productivity improvements during early flow back, but we need more time to evaluate the results. We\u2019re on track to drill 520 net Eagle Ford Wells this year. By midyear we had brought 260 wells to sales. On our last earnings call we talked about the depth and longevity of oil growth from our Eagle Ford asset. Nothing has changed in our view. In Trinidad we have a three well, net well development drilling program planned for 2014, which will allow us to maintain flat natural gas production in coming years. In the East Irish Sea, the Conway project is now expected to be online early 2015 due to certain scheduling matters with the platform operator. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financial and capital structure. Tim Diggers : Thanks Bill. Before getting into the specifics on CapEx and guidance I want to point out a new IR slide on page 14 using actuals and sell-side estimates we compared EOG\u2019s 2013 and 2014 estimated ROE and ROCE to the average of the majors integrated independent E&Ps for the same period. What stands out from the chart is EOG\u2019s financial returns relative to the other sectors. In the energy space, there are sectors known for growth and those known for returns. But rarely does the company or sector combine high production growth with outstanding financial returns. We believe EOG is currently exhibiting among the best financial returns in the entire industry combined with excellent production growth. For the second quarter capitalized interest was $14 million. Total cash exploration and development expenditures were $2 billion excluding asset retirement obligations. In addition expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $237 million. EOG made $74 million of acquisitions during the quarter. At the end of June total debt outstanding was $5.9 billion. At June 30 we had $1.2 billion of cash on hand. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 36% and the deferred tax ratio was 62%. Yesterday we included guidance table with the earnings press release for the third quarter and full-year 2014. For the third quarter and full year the effective tax rate is estimated to be 35% to 40%. We've also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we have, that we expect to record during the third quarter and for the full year. In terms of our hedge positions, for the period August 1 through December 31, 2014 EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 194,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of $96.19 per barrel. For the first half of 2015 we have 69,000 barrels per day of crude oil options that could be put to us at an average price of $95.20 per barrel. For the period September 1 through December 31, 2014 EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 330,000 MMbtu per day at a weighted average price of $4.55 per MMbtu. For the period January 1 through December 31, 2015 EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 175,000 MMbtu per day at a weighted average price of $4.51 per MMbtu. These numbers exclude options that are exercisable by our counterparties. For the period January 1through December 31, 2015 we have 175,000 MMbtu per day of options that could be put to us at an average price of $4.51 per Mmbtu for each month. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Bill to provide the EOG\u2019s views regarding the macro environment and a summary. Bill Thomas :  Thanks Tim. We remain bullish on crude oil prices. We are advocates of free markets and are proponents of condensate and crude oil exports. While the opening up of condensate exports will create more headroom for refiners to process light oil even without exports we still see several years of headroom in the US refining complex.  Regarding North American natural gas, we don't have any plans to reinvest in dry gas drilling opportunities at current prices, as we expect that the strength we saw in gas prices earlier this year was only a temporary and driven by the coldest winter weather in 14 years. Recent high storage injection numbers again have verified the enormous supply deliverability on untapped Shale gas in the US. This provides solid support for rapid approval of additional LNG export terminals. Our 2014 plan remains consistent with what we outlined at the beginning of the year. We continue to reinvest in high rate of return crude oil weighted drilling opportunities. We increased our crude oil growth forecast in May 29%. And this quarter we are increasing EOG\u2019s total company production growth estimate to 14% from 12%, based on growth from associated NGL and natural gas production from our crude oil plays.  Our CapEx estimate remains unchanged. We have now increased the common stock dividend twice this year. Now let me conclude there are five important takeaways from this call. First, EOG is focused on returns. EOG\u2019s high return production growth is showing up as strong growth in cash flow, net income and through increasing ROE and ROCE metrics. The Bakken, Eagle Ford and Leonard have the potential to sustain above average long-term growth with very high returns. EOG is well-positioned to be a long-term leader in returns on capital in the energy sector.  Second, EOG is a growth leader and it's organic. EOG\u2019s estimated 2014 oil growth on a barrel per day basis is greater than any other company in the peer group and this growth is all organic. We have the assets and the inventory depth to sustain this growth. Please take a look at the new IR slide on page 7, growing oil as we did 33% in the Lower 48 this quarter is a remarkable achievement. Third exploration and technology focus, we\u2019ve again increased our high return drilling inventory on existing acreage with the addition of the Second Bone Spring Sand. We also reported good preliminary down spacing results from the Leonard A and B zones. The Second Bone Spring Sand and the Leonard Down spacing results are two examples of how EOG generates new plays through exploration and the use of in-house technology. Fourth, we're committed to generating long-term value for our stockholders. We increased the dividend on the common stock for the second time this year. This combined with net debt reduction has been our plan for discretionary cash flow. Finally our return on growth profile is unique. As Tim pointed out, based on 2014 estimates we are at the head of the class in terms of combined production growth and financial returns among all upstream sectors including the majors, integrators and independents. That's a powerful statement and our IR slide on page 14 is quite impressive regarding financial returns and we plan to maintain this lead by continuing to reinvest in high rate of return oil plays. Thanks for listening and now we\u2019ll go to Q&A. Operator :  Thank you, the question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Amir Arif with Stifel. Amir Arif - Stifel Nicolaus :  Good morning guys, a quick question on the Bone Springs. The 73,000 acres that you talked about for the Second Bone Springs, is that just on the New Mexico side? Or does that also include acreage on the Texas side? Billy Helms : Yeah Amir, our 73,000 acre position both in Leonard and the Bones Springs does cross the state lines. So it is both located in the Mexico and Texas. What\u2019s interesting to note about the second Bone Springs Wells is they are about 5 miles apart, they do help confirm the potential on a lot of our acreage and certainly with the well-control we have in the play. We feel good about the extent of what we've seen so far. We are early in the testing of those zones but it is they do represent two of the most South-East wells in the play as far as wells completed in the Second Bone Springs Sand. So we certainly feel good about what we see so far. But we\u2019ll have to evaluate long-term production to assess the potential to the company. Amir Arif - Stifel Nicolaus : Okay, and as a follow-up, I know it\u2019s still early days in the play like you just mentioned. But could you just give us how you are thinking about the development right now in terms of the Leonard AP and the Bone Spring in terms of , is one going to be your primary target or infrastructure build out the support one versus the other or each one is given a return, each one could be a primary target. Billy Helms : Well I think that\u2019s a good way to think about it. I think each one can be a primary target on zone. Infrastructure is certainly in place for our current activity and takeaway capacity and certainly we try to stay ahead of that as we develop the plays. We will be testing as we mentioned in the in the call or in the press release we have tested number patterns for the Leonard, especially the A zone and are Gemini wells that are spaced to 300feet apart in the Leonard A- zone in and certainly we're excited about potential we see there. But we\u2019ll have to determine what the ultimate spacing will be in each zone as we progress. These two wells in the Palm Springs of mentioned earlier they are about 5 miles apart. So there have not been any spacing tests conducted on the Bone Springs yet. And so we\u2019ll have to go through that exercise and it will take care several months to work through that and why additional wells planned in the in the rest of the year to try to assess how we move forward that program. Operator :  We\u2019ll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I wonder if I could try two quick ones. First of all, Bill, in your prepared remarks you did mention the Eagle Ford. I wondered if you could help dig a little bit deeper into the impact of the need to change to drill retention wells, is the way you put it on the call. And if we might expect to see the growth rate accelerate again in the second half as you get back to your more normal order of business. That's my first question. Billy Helms : Yeah, good morning Doug. Yeah, the retention wells we talked about, we were mainly in the western part of our acreage where we go out and we drill wells on the initial unit just to the hold the acreage and we\u2019ve completed most of that drilling for this year the first half of the year. So in the second half of the year we will be doing as we talked about in early remarks, will be doing considerably more pad drilling. So that means we come back in and follows retention wells and other areas and we drill multi-well pads and we drill these wells in large groups and we complete these wells in large groups and so they, when we do this , we do get more efficiencies and cost. But the production is a bit more lumpy as we go forward, as we do the more of the pad drilling. So the main benefit is the efficiencies and cost to do the drilling, being able to drill wells on multiple well pads. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Bill, just to be clear, I'm guessing your average -- we don't obviously have the full disclosure on this, but the average well rates then out of the average well and not in the second quarter would presumably have been lower. But you're basically saying that really was more of an anomaly than something that's changing in the program? Is that a good way to think about it? Bill Thomas : Yeah, the average rate on the wells have been improving over time. We\u2019re still making in completion improvements. Steady will slide in our IR presentation particularly on the western wells and so the new better completion techniques we\u2019re doing on wells, continue to make better wells. But really we don't see a significant change from the first half of the second. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : My follow-up is really more of a philosophical question. Obviously you've done a terrific job on the returns per your slide presentation compared to the different peer groups. By putting yourself in that -- it's fun to look at those big oil metrics if you like. I wonder how you think about the dividend. Obviously a big dividend bump this quarter again, but it's still a very modest yield. How do you think longer term about what the right level of dividend is for a company of your size with a growth trajectory and calls on capital that you have? Because, again, when you start to compare yourself to that wider peer group, some of those guys have 3%, 4%, 5% dividend yields and obviously you're substantially below that. Longer-term, how should we think about your allocation of capital to the dividend on a go forward basis? Bill Thomas : That\u2019s a good question, Doug, we don't have a policy, so as we go forward the board will just continue to look at our cash flow and where we are at the company, on what we need to do to continue to grow the company. And we will give dividends appropriately based on the situation of the company. So certainly we\u2019ve had a good track record 16, increases in 15 years and we\u2019re certainly committed to long-term shareholder value creation. Operator : We will go next to Leo Mariani with RBC Capital. Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets : Just wanted to dive into some of the new plays. Obviously you talked about the Second Bone Springs here today. Last quarter you introduced a number of new Rockies plays as well. Can you give us a sense of how you plan to allocate capital to these new plays this year and next? Is there any plays there that are a priority? Are there any limitations on infrastructure or any need to hold acreage that governs any of that? Maybe talk to how we should see activity levels in those new plays over the next year or two. Bill Thomas : As far as the new play, they are all in a bit different situation, certainly plays that we talked about in the first quarter call in the Power River basin and DJ basin, we\u2019re moving ahead with the development on those most of it\u2019s on multi-well pad drilling and we\u2019re defining spacing patterns and optimizing our completions and costs and those will get capital allocation as we see the results of the wells and again the plays with the best rate of return will get the most capital as we go forward. On the Bone Springs we are new into that, as Billy talked about, we drilled two really strong wells and we will be evaluating that play as we go forward. But as we look in to the future everything EOG does is focused on return on capital invested, so each play will get rewarded based on that. Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets : Switching gears a little bit, you guys did take your gas and NGL production guidance up here in 2014. You talked about associated gas in liquids from your oil plays. Could you give us a little bit more color on specifically where that's coming from in terms of the incremental associated gas here? Bill Thomas : Yes, Leo we had a couple things in the first half of the year and the second quarter. We have added infrastructure particularly in midland that\u2019s helped our gas takeaway situation there and deliverability. We did in our Barnett combo play, we had a number of wells on restricted flow rates due to pressure control and we did open up some of those in the second quarter a little bit. But just in general as we stated in the opening remarks we increased our oil in the first quarter and this is kind of a follow up as we have associated gas with all of our crude oil plays, our base decline in our natural gas is slowing due to not much natural \u2013 but no natural gas drilling and no property sales and so our associated gas with a crude oil plays is beginning to overcome that decline. Operator : We will go next to Pearce Hammond with Simmons. Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company : Bill, I noticed a change in the completed well costs in the Eagle Ford. Looked like it moved up to $5.7 million from $5.5 million. Is that just more longer lateral, more sand? And does that $5.7 million yield bigger wells? Gary Thomas : Yes, you are exactly right, we\u2019re drilling the longer laterals, they are about 10% larger -- longer and with that of course roughly $1000 traded lateral, that\u2019s adding quite a bit of additional cost but we\u2019ve been able to reduce that with just continued efficiencies and our number of days per well has dropped quite lot here this last quarter, as a matter of fact, we set a new record this quarter once again with a 4.3 day well to 15,600 feet, so we are seeing improved wells, I think that was placed 20 in our chart shows that the wells are about 15% better this year than last. Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company : Then my follow-up is, Bill, can you provide some color on your \u201815 oil hedging strategy? Bill Thomas : Historically and I think business wise we would like to have a good hedge position going forward in oil and gas, the difficulty has been that backwardation in the forward curve on both gas and oil we don't see as reflective of what\u2019s going to happen in the future, so it's difficult to get a good hedge. But we\u2019re certainly looking for opportunities as we go forward in the second half of the year to add some hedges in oil and gas if they are available. Operator : We will go next to Subash Chandra with Jefferies Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company : A Permian question for my first one. So casual reading of these well results indicate that there's not a vast difference in the IPs that were quoted. Yet Wolfcamp, much higher EURs expected, and a much higher resource potential expected out of the Wolfcamp itself. Could you just add perhaps a bit more color to what you saw after these IPs that indicate that the Wolfcamp is 60% higher in terms of EURs per well than say, a Leonard, and a comp to the Second Bone Springs? Billy Helms : This is Billy Helms, I will answer this Permian question. For the Leonard and in both the Wolfcamp each one independent zones, the Leonard is more of a oil play, it has a different production profile certainly than that the Wolfcamp which is more of a combo-ish kind of play. So the production profiles although they may start at somewhat similar IPs on oil, production profile is certainly different because they are different types of reservoirs, so the decline rates will be different, the product mix is certainly different. And so it's going to yield different EURs over the life of the well. We\u2019re also -- that will also play into how we develop the field and the ultimate spacing of the wells as well. So the Leonard as you saw we\u2019re testing down to some wells that are at 300 foot spacing and Wolfcamp we\u2019re generally testing closer to 750 foot spacing as we go through the play, so those are just some differences between the two different reservoirs, they are quite different certainly and have different zones of targets but that's the basic difference between the two. Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company : And Billy, what do you see happening with the rig count in the various Permian plays over the next year? Billy Helms : Well certainly I expect this with success we would expect activity to increase in the Permian over time. The luxury we have right now is we have just a large number of really high quality plays in the company where we can allocate capital, so what it does is it gives us the time to go through and make sure we understand the proper completion techniques and the proper spacing before we really start increasing activity in each play. That helps make us a little bit smarter on overall development and still provide long-term growth for the company. So we\u2019re pretty excited about the potential we see there in the Permian and we\u2019re taking our time to really make sure that we understand how to complete and what the proper spacing of each one of those zones will be before we really ramp up activity too quickly. Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company : And my follow-up. I don't know if EOG participated in the Turner Mason study or not. I guess the net conclusion is that they're arguing for a riskier packaging number, but essentially no change in the type of railcar to carry Bakken crude. As you're obviously on the upstream and the midstream side of the transportation side of it, what are your takeaways? Bill Thomas : We are certainly conservative on everything we do or we\u2019re concerned about safety and we\u2019re certainly all in favor of many of the things that have been proposed and I guess the new guidelines didn\u2019t really catch us by surprise, we are prepared for those as we go forward and we\u2019re solidly behind - the activity to increase the safety of rails as we go forward. Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company : Or more specifically, do you think there needs to be a change in the 111 railcars to carry Bakken crude? Bill Thomas : We are very well-positioned there with the contracts that we have and we\u2019re still reviewing these rules but as our cars that go off the least we will be going with the cars of the future, so we really like the way we\u2019re positioned to be able to have the most safe and regulatory compliant rail fleet. Operator : We will go next to Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities. Irene Haas - Wunderlich Securities : My question is on the land that's also called Avalon. You mentioned earlier that is a different beast from the Wolfcamp Shale. So can you shed a little light on whether it's a true shale or is it something else? And then does it have really high IPA and how does it drop off? Because I think it can get pretty steep. And also in your past PowerPoint in July, I think you mentioned about three zones in the Leonard. These are my questions. Bill Thomas : The Leonard is a shale, and it\u2019s really the third best reservoir in terms of shale we really have in the company. It\u2019s a very high porosity shale with really we've identified at this point two zones, the A and B zone and the content of the reserve is about 50% oil and they start off at very high rates and have excellent rates of return in the shale. So we\u2019re fortunate our acreage position we believe has captured much of its weak spot of the play and we\u2019ve had, as Billy talked about we've had very good success on increasing the per well productivity with our new completion techniques and also been able to test wells at very tight spacing with at least initial good results. So we think we can continue to improve the play and add value as we go forward in our development process. Irene Haas - Wunderlich Securities : How is the declines? Billy Helms : I would say the decline in the Leonard play \u2013 I would say it's not too different than many of our other shale plays in that they are hyperbolic in nature, they fall off fairly fast and I don't know \u2013 couldn\u2019t quote a number right now as far as the initial decline on the well but they are very similar to most of our other shale plays, very hyperbolic in nature but they produced a level out produced for a long time at very good rates. So they do provide excellent economics as we would \u2013 as we reported earlier, the current rate of return for that play is over hundred percent as well. So we\u2019re very excited about the potential of development of the play and economics of that play. Operator : We will go next to Joe Allman with JPMorgan. Joe Allman - JPMorgan : One quick question on down-spacing, it seems like there's an awful lot of down spacing going on at EOG. So could you run us through the various plays, so for example, on the Leonard shale, I know you did 300 foot inter lateral spacing and you\u2019re doing some additional pilots, are you testing down to 150s and then in the Eagle Ford, you\u2019re doing some additional pilots, are you going down to 20s, there, could you talk about down spacing in the Bakken and in Wyoming, and what the implications are for the increase in locations? Bill Thomas : Yeah, Bill, let me just go through -- that's a good question -- each one of those plays a bit. So in the Eagle Ford we\u2019re currently developing that play on about 40 acre spacing and there are some areas where \u2013 and That\u2019s about 300 feet between wells on average. There are some wells where the well spacing is greater than 300 feet and we are doing a bit of infill field work, in some of those areas we don't have any news to report on that other than the early results look good. And we need some long-term results on that before we can determine if that\u2019s the best way to do those areas. In the Bakken, we\u2019re on our third set of down spacing in the Bakken and we have had very good success with 1300feet between wells which is approximately 4 wells per section. Now we are testing approximately 700 feet between wells, that would be eight wells per section. And as Billy reported on that we have a few wells that are flowing back and those initial results look good. But we do need quite a bit more time to watch the long-term production of those wells and then also watch additional wells as we bring them on line on those spacing patterns. And in the Leonard, we've gone from 660 foot spacing and we tested various spacing patterns down to 300 feet between the wells. We do not have any plans to go less than 300 feet in the same zone between wells, so where we are on that process is we\u2019re just evaluating all those different spacing patterns to determine what's the proper spacing to fully develop the field. Joe Allman - JPMorgan : If you could comment on Wyoming as well, that would be great. And then a follow-up question. Then comment on the implication for locations, if you can give us any specifics on that. But follow-up question would be, you're talking about increasing E&P activity in 2015 versus 2014. So is your plan to be free cash flow positive in 2015 and increase the balance sheet as you suggest in some of your comments, or do you plan on matching fairly closely cash flow to CapEx and talk about what the optimal debt level is in that context?. Bill Thomas : Yeah, Joe, that certainly we\u2019re beginning to think about 2015 but we just don't have any specific guidance on that other than we\u2019re going to reinvest the majority of our growing cash flow. We\u2019re going to continue to reinvest that back into the highest rate return plays that we have and we will be looking at certainly the drilling program this year, and the results and all these different spacing patterns and the well productivity and the return on all these and we will just allocate that to continue to grow the company very strongly. But to really to focus on returns and our net debt to cap ratio continues to fall in the company and we want to continue to strengthen the balance sheet as we go forward and allocate our capital based on those metrics. Joe Allman - JPMorgan : Any comments on the spacing pilot you're doing in Wyoming? Bill Thomas : Joe, in Wyoming, in the DJ basin, we\u2019re drilling alternating Niobrara and Codell targets and those spacing patterns on various different spacing between wells but there are approximately 800 feet apart and so we will be looking at those, initial patterns and see how those respond. And then in the Parkman zone, we\u2019re currently developing a 1300 feet between wells and drilling longer laterals in that particular play and in the Turner we\u2019re developing on 1355 feet between zones. And again each one of these we\u2019d like to get multiple patterns established and we\u2019d like to get long-term results to see how much sharing \u2013 if sharing the risk between wells and then we make appropriate adjustments as we go forward. So it\u2019s kind of the long-term process. And we\u2019re very focused on maximizing the net present value of each of these properties and to maximize the reserve recovery and the value of the property, so that's kind of the status on those plays. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Bob Brackett with Bernstein. Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein : Good morning. Quick question on new ventures. Can you talk a little about the lower tests in the Three Forks? And maybe anything on East Texas you're willing to share? Bill Thomas : Good morning, Bob. Thanks for the question. In the Three Forks we do have some wells planned particularly in our Antelope acreage. We do have a third match plan, the test later in the year and some, I believe, probably first and second batch also test to continue to evaluate that.  Yeah, I would say Bob, on East Texas, you know everybody knows we are drilling a few wells over there and evaluating the play, as well as plays in other parts of the country too. So it's just a part of our continuing exploration effort in the company to define new play potential. As you know we have a very very high cut-off for new play. So we\u2019re not interested in pursuing plays that have a 20% or 30% rate of return potential, we\u2019ve really set the bar high and we\u2019re looking for plays and only would be able to generate say north of 50% rates return going forward and we\u2019re still \u2013 we\u2019re very focused on crude oil plays. So the East Texas is just a part of that mix, and we will continue testing that and when we get some information that\u2019s meaning, and something that we will go forward on, we can talk about that later but right now that's all the information we have. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs : I wanted to follow-up on a couple of earlier topics, starting with the Leonard. The potential for a 300-foot spacing in the Leonard would seem to imply tighter spacing, at least at your base case lateral length relative to some of the other plays out there. Can you just talk about unique characteristics you see in the Leonard relative to other plays in other parts of the Delaware basin? And how you're thinking about both recovery rates and the trade-off of longer laterals versus tighter spacing? Billy Helms : Yeah, Brian, this is Bill Helms. On the spacing for the Leonard, this is the same approach we\u2019ve really taken in every play that we undertake. It\u2019s to try to understand what\u2019s the right spacing given the current state of our completion technology in each lateral to maximize the net present value of every acre that we have under lease. And so for the Leonard, we started out with 660 foot spacing and we continue to test tighter spacing in each one of our subsequent patterns to understand what is the right formula to maximize our net present value and certainly the Gemini wells that we highlighted in the press release are encouraging for 300 foot space well. I would say that we need a little bit more production time to really understand what the optimal spacing pattern is going to be for that Leonard A zone as we go forward. And then similarly we will do the same thing for the Leonard B zone as well as the Wolfcamp zones in the Delaware as we start through the development in each one of those. So it\u2019s a similar process we go through in each play. For the Leonard it's just -- it's really \u2013 as Bill mentioned earlier it\u2019s a high quality shale across the good mechanical properties, that allows us to really focus the fracs near wellbore and maximize recovery of each well and that's different than some of the other plays. Of course each play has its own characteristics and mechanical properties that dictate what the proper spacing will be and that's why these very methodical spacing tests are needed to try to determine what the optimal will be on each pattern. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs : And then in the Eagle Ford, you have a slide -- slide 20, where you're showing further improvement in well performance this year relative to last year. You talked about the greater, the more complex fracs and slightly higher well costs. Is that what's reflected here or is there further upside to EURs? Are you just getting oil out of the ground earlier via completion efficiencies? And are there any changes to your thoughts on recovery rates in oil in place in the Eagle Ford? Bill Thomas : It\u2019s a little early to determine what recovery factors is now with these enhanced completions. But, yes, we\u2019re really excited about what\u2019s transpired here just this year in the Eagle Ford, because more of our wells are being drilled in the West side which previously thought -- we thought was maybe less productive. But with more wells there, then we\u2019re drilled longer laterals, enhanced completions, then overall \u2013 the average of the wells drilled in 2014 is quite lot better than the wells \u2013 the average of the wells drilled in 2013. It\u2019s just improved completions. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs : And are you seeing any change in the decline rates being greater? Or should one expect that these greater rates should carry into, and well performance through 60 days, should carry into EUR? Bill Thomas : We would expect \u2013 that we would see with the same kind of IPs, and the wells even holding up better 60, 90 days that we would see improvement there as well, as far as long-term production. We do have longer laterals and we just need additional time on these. Billy Helms : Yeah, I think the important thing on that Brian is that it is really critical that we get long-term data on each one of these plays and that goes for the Eagle Ford in particular is that we just want to see more than 90 days production to determine what the ultimate EUR will be, and especially as we continue to work the spacing issues, it\u2019s very critical to take our time and to get enough data before we can say whether there is an EUR the increase or not. Operator : We will take our next question from Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse. Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse : I did want to talk to you a little bit, maybe a follow-up to Joe's question. But as you sit here today, Bill, you have a bigger opportunity set than you had perhaps 6 or 12 months ago, given the Rockies oil opportunity. The Delaware Basin opportunity looks bigger. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on potentially, as you look forward to perhaps increasing CapEx beyond cash flows. You're pretty bullish on oil. Your debt to cap is down to 21%. And you did have a big dividend increase. So just some thoughts, given the increasing opportunity set at EOG, to take that CapEx to accelerate your returns profile even more. Bill Thomas : Arun, I think what you can expect from EOG going forward is discipline -- capital discipline is at the top of our list and so we are really focused on operating the company relatively within our cash flow going forward. We\u2019re very focused on keeping the balance sheet solid as we go forward, at net debt to cap at a low level and really discipline -- each of these plays, as you focus on rates of return, capital rates of return and maximize the value of the plays, it\u2019s important not to grow or accelerate them too fast. And so we\u2019re really focused on doing that correctly and continuing to focus on crude oil, not interested in gas drilling and that we\u2019re really focused on growing the cash flow of the company forward, of investments in our crude oil really. Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse : And that would, again, suggest maybe staying within cash flows? Bill Thomas : I think we want to operate the company with discipline in spending and certainly not outrun the cash flow of the company. Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse : And just a quick follow-up, switching gears to the Delaware basin. Bill, you talked about 550 million barrel resource opportunity in the Leonard, two zones there. Just wondering what the spacing assumptions were that underpin that. And perhaps, given the successful downspacing tests, you're perhaps looking at maybe even 16 wells for each of the zones. I was wondering if you can comment on what that 550 was underpinned by from a spacing perspective? Bill Thomas : So I will ask Bill Helms to give some color on that. Billy Helms : The Leonard, we originally arrived at our EURs the ultimate recovery from that field, from that play, using a 660 foot spacing for all the Leonard wells and certainly we have potential for some multiple pay zones in some areas, although we will need to consider all the targets perspective over all the pay zone, over all the acreage but in general it's a 660 foot between wells which is roughly an 80 acre spacing per well, and as mentioned we're \u2013 our Gemini wells, we did test down to 300 and while it\u2019s still early we still need some production time to understand what the ultimate spacing will be for that play. Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse : And that would be for the A and B zones? Billy Helms : Yes, that\u2019s what we used in our initial estimates, yes. I would mention too that we wouldn't have considered all the zones perspective over all the acreage, so I caution you there . Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse : And I know it's early days, but how is the Bones Spring -- little bit more oil content. Are the returns compared to the Leonard, at least on your initial wells, similar? Billy Helms : Yeah, I would say they are very similar as far as returns, we\u2019re -- honestly we just had the first two wells down this acreage position and we\u2019re very excited about it. But as you mentioned it is early and we will certainly need to watch production for a while and as Bill mentioned we like to have a little more than 90 days of production, I\u2019d say more than 90 days production to evaluate the ultimate recovery from all these wells. Operator : At this time I would like to turn it back to Mr. Thomas for additional or closing remarks. Bill Thomas : Well thank you for listening and thank you for all the good questions, and just know that EOG as we go forward is a company that's unique, we\u2019re focused on returns, continuing to improve our ROE and ROIC numbers and strong crude oil growth.

Bernstein Irene Haas - Wunderlich Securities Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities Charles Meade - Johnson Rice Matt Portillo - TPH Operator : Please standby, we are about to begin. Good day, everyone. And welcome to the EOG Resources\u2019 Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir. Tim Driggers : Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing third quarter 2014 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable reserves, as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website. Participating on the call this morning are, Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, Executive VP, Exploration and Production; David Trice, Executive VP, Exploration and Production; and Mario Baldwin, Vice President, IR; and Lance Terveen, Vice President, Marketing Operations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening and we included fourth quarter and full year guidance in yesterday's press release. This morning we will discuss topics in the following order. I will first review our 2014 third quarter net income and discretionary cash flow, and then Bill Thomas, David Trice and Billy Helms will provide operational results, I\u2019ll then address EOG's financials, capital structure and hedge position. Finally, Bill Thomas will provide concluding remarks. As outlined in our press release, for the third quarter 2014, EOG reported net income of $1,103.6 million or $2.01 per share. EOG's third quarter 2014 adjusted non-GAAP net income, which eliminates the mark-to-market impacts and certain non-recurring items as outlined in the press release was $720.6 million or $1.31 per share. Non-GAAP discretionary cash flow for the third quarter was $2.2 billion. At September 30, 2014, the debt-to-total cap ratio was 25%. Adjusting for cash the net debt-to-total cap ratio was 20%, down from 23% at December 31. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Bill Thomas to discuss operational results and key plays. Bill Thomas : Thanks, Tim. EOG continues to deliver outstanding production growth and financial metrics by consistently executing on our strategy of investing in high return organic crude oil growth. For the third quarter, all three of our productions components exceeded our expectations and are unit costs were below our forecast. Total company crude oil and condensate production was up 27% for the third quarter and 33% compared to the first nine months of 2013. Total liquids production, including NGLs increased 27% for the third quarter and 31% for the first nine months. Based on these results, we are raising our full year crude oil growth target for the second time this year to 31% from 29%. We are increasing our total company production growth target of 16.5% from 14% based on outperformance from our Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin assets. I will now address the Eagle Ford, then David Trice will provide an operational update on the Permian, and Billy Helms will discuss the Bakken and Rockies plays. In the Eagle Ford, I can characterize our current activity in three points. One, the Eagle Ford is on track for multiyear growth; two, we continue to make enhancements in completion; and three, the Eagle Ford is the industry's best crude oil asset and we\u2019ve captured the sweet spot. I\u2019ll now address each point in more detail. First one, the Eagle Ford is on a growth trend for the next 10 years. On the May earnings call, we indicated our model was based on making a modest increase to 520 net wells we had initially planned this year and holding net well count flat through 2004. In this scenario, the oil production rose for 10 years, based on our production this year, we are set up to achieve this upward growth curve. Second point, our well quality continues to improve with completion enhancements, even after five years, we are still experimenting with completion designs and we continue to see improved well productivity and higher overall MPB. Our completions are customized for specific rock properties not only in each well, but in each and every stage within the well. We've been testing what we call high-density frac. In one area, we saw a 39% improvement in well productivity from this new frac design, relative to adjacent wells. Year-to-date, we have seen a 10% average improvement in well performance from our Western Eagle Ford acreage drilling activity. We have included illustrations in our accompanying IR slides for reference. Third point, the Eagle Ford continues to be the industries and EOG\u2019s premiere crude play in North America for both production growth and financial returns. Our drilling program will remain very profitable, despite fluctuations in oil process. At $80 oil, the eagle ford will still generate direct after-tax rates of return in excess of 100%. At less than $40 oil, we would still achieve a minimum 10% direct a-tax rate of return. The Eagle Ford remains EOG\u2019s highest rate of return asset. While we still see some cost pressure and completion services, we are able to control costs increases largely with our self-source sand and other completion materials. We also continue to make progress reducing drilling days during the second and third quarter. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve decreased our average drilling days by 12% in the Eagle Ford. One final point, we would caution those who used monthly Texas Railroad Commission's state data as a measure of company current production and a forecasting tool for future production. Remember, the State Data tends to lag and it\u2019s potentially incomplete on a month-to-month basis for a variety of reasons. To wrap up the Eagle Ford, EOG\u2019s long-term oil growth will be anchored by this world class asset, where we are still improving well productivity through new completion designs and by lowering well costs. I will now turn it over to David Trice to discuss EOG\u2019s activity in the Permian. David Trice : Thanks, Bill. In the Delaware Basin, we continue to test and drill step out wells to confirm the viability of each of our three plays across our acreage. In the Wolfcamp, we had exciting news in the third quarter. After testing some of our Northern Delaware Basin acreage, we confirm that a majority of it is in the highly over-pressured crude oil window where we expect the wells to be 50% crude oil. We completed two upper Wolfcamp horizontal wells, which flow 46 degree API gravity crude oil. The Voyager 15 number 3H was completed at a maximum oil rate of 1,890 barrels of oil per day, with 385 barrels per day of NGLs and 2.5 million cubic feet a day of natural gas from a 4,400 foot-treated lateral. The well had a 30-day average rate of 1,500 barrels of oil per day with 365 barrel per day of NGLs and 2.3 million cubic feet of gas per day. The Voyager is located along the Texas, New Mexico Stateline in Loving County, Texas. EOG has a 48% working interest in this well. The Diamond SM 36 State number 1H flowed at a maximum rate of 1,340 barrels of oil per day, 195 barrels per day of NGLs and 1.3 million cubic feet of gas from a 2,200 foot-treated lateral. This well is north of the Voyager in Lee County, New Mexico in the heart of our Red Hills acreage and EOG has 100% working interest in this well. We\u2019ve done some preliminary G&G work and have confirm that 90,000 net acres of our hydrated 140,000 net acres in the Delaware Wolfcamp are in a highly over-pressured crude oil window. We plan to increase our Wolfcamp drilling activity in this crude oil window, where we expect to achieve reinvestment returns much higher than the combo window and competitive with our second Bone Spring Sand and Leonard plays. In the second Bone Springs Sand, we drilled our third well in the Red Hills area during the third quarter. It was a 20-mile step out from our first two wells to further confirm the viability of our acreage. The State Magellan number 2H near the Stateline in Loving County, Texas was completed with a 4,900 foot-treated lateral and flowed at a maximum rate of 1,825 barrels oil per day of 44 degree API gravity oil with associated production of 295 barrels of NGLs per day and 2.2 million cubic feet of gas per day. These wells are 70% crude oil. The State Magellan well gives us additional confidence in the plays they will extend and following additional geological work on our existing acreage, we\u2019ve increased the prospectivity of the second Bone Spring Sand to at least 90,000 net acres. The Leonard Shale also continues to deliver solid well results. In the third quarter, we turned the State Pathfinder 1H to sales with the maximum rate of 1,370 barrels of oil per day, 245 barrels per day of NGLs and 1.3 million cubic feet of gas per day. The well was part of the 450 foot spacing test and has a 4800 foot-treated lateral. Going forward, we plan to develop the Leonard 300 to 450 foot spacing. We've also modestly increased our holdings to 80,000 net acres in this play. We plan to increase our activity in the Delaware Basin from four rigs at the end of the third quarter to eight rigs by year end. We plan to drill additional wells in the Wolfcamp second Bone Spring Sand and Leonard then anticipate in our original plan. To summarize our activity in the Delaware, we had a very promising result after drilling our first two oil wells in the crude oil window in the Wolfcamp where we have 90,000 net acres. With an additional data point, we are getting further confidence in the second Bone Springs Sand and we continue to deliver excellent wells result from the Leonard, even as we further downspace the wells. With these three outstanding plays, EOG is well-positioned for higher rate return crude oil growth in the Permian for many years. I will now turn it over to Billy Helms to discuss the Bakken and the Rockies. Billy Helms : Thanks, David. We began our downspacing campaign in the Bakken Core at the beginning of the year by systematically testing spacing patterns, starting at 1,300 feet between wells. With confidence from the production profiles of the 1,300 foot spaced wells, we begin testing 700 foot spacing earlier this year and now have data from the wells that have been producing for four to seven months. Simultaneous with downspacing, we have seen improvements in well productivity after introducing new completion technology to the field. We are encouraged by early indications from the 700 foot spaced wells, but we need additional time to assess the impact on long-term production, reserves and ultimately the net present value. We also have product spacing test with 500 foot and 300 foot patterns to determine the optimal spacing to maximize the net present value of the field. We noted a number of new core wells in our press release, the Parshall 44-1004H came on line at 2,710 barrels of oil per day, with 875 Mcf per day of rich natural gas and the Parshall 46-1004H came on line at 2,105 barrels of oil per day with 860 Mcf per day of rich natural gas. We have 69% working interest in both of these wells. As we noted in our press release, in the Antelope Extension area, we had success from the Three Forks -- first, second and third benches. We completed our first well in the third bench of the Three Forks, the Mandaree 134-05H, which came on line at 1,410 barrels of oil per day with 2.2 million cubic feet of natural gas. We have 70% working interest in this well. We will continue testing the potential of the Three Forks across our Antelope acreage and we will expand our Three Forks testing in the core in 2015. In the DJ Basin, we completed our first seven-well development pattern on a multi-well pad, consisting of four Niobrara and three Codell wells. The wells were drilled with long laterals spaced at approximately 700 feet between wells in the same zone. The seven wells came on line at a combined rate in excess of 7,800 barrels of oil per day with 5.4 million cubic feet per day of rich natural gas. We have 75% working interest in these wells. We plan to test spacing patterns in various completion tasks for the balance of the year. Early production results verify initial type curves and provide confirmation of our EUR estimates. This program is delivering consistent initial production rates of 1,000 barrels of oil per day per well. We are rapidly climbing the operational learning curve in this play and expect to achieve our well cost targets in the near-term. In the Powder River Basin, we have maintained our one rig program and are on track to drill 34 net wells this year, targeting the Parkman and Turner reservoirs. In the Turner Sand, we completed two wells, the Mary's Draw 24-13H and 25-13H, for a combined rate of 1,880 barrels of oil per day, with 3.1 million cubic feet per day of rich natural gas. We have one new well from the Parkman. The Mary's Draw 412-1527H came on line at 1,190 barrels of oil per day, with 270 Mcf per day of rich gas. In Trinidad, we are actively drilling out three net well development program which will allow us to maintain flat natural gas production in coming years. I will now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure. Tim Driggers : Thanks, Billy. For the third quarter, capitalized interest was $14.5 million. Total cash exploration and development expenditures were $2.0 billion, excluding asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $184 million. Year-to-date total exploration and development expenditures were $5.8 million, excluding asset retirement obligations. Expenditures for gathering, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $587 million. We had $17 million of proceeds from asset sales during the quarter and there were no acquisitions. At the end of September, total debt outstanding was $5.9 billion. At September 30, we had $1.5 billion of cash on hand. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 36% and the deferred tax ratio was 81%. Yesterday we included a guidance table with earnings press release for the fourth quarter and full year 2014. For the fourth quarter and full year, the effective tax rate is estimated to be 32% to 37% and 34% to 37% respectively. We have also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount at current taxes that we expect to report during the fourth quarter and for the full year. In terms of our hedge positions, for the period November 1 through December 31, 2014 EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 192,000 barrels of oil per day at weighted average price of $96.15 per barrel. For the first half of 2015, we have 47,000 barrels per day of crude oil hedge at an average price of $91.22 per barrel. For the second half of 2015, EOG has 10,000 barrels per day of crude oil hedge at an average price of $89.98 per barrel. These numbers exclude options that are exercisable by our counterparties. For the month of December 2014, EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 330,000 MMBtu per day at weighted average price of $4.55 per MMBtu. For the period January 1 through December 31, 2015 EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 175,000 MMBtu per day at a weighted average price of $4.51 per MMBtu. For the same period, we have a 175,000 MMBtu per day of options that could be exercised by our counterparties at an average price of $4.51 per MMBtu for each month. Now I will turn it back to Bill to discuss EOG\u2019s overview for 2015 and provide the summary. Bill Thomas : Thanks, Tim. Now for our 2015 overview. Although our planning process won't be complete until the beginning of the year, I want to provide some color regarding our 2015 capital allocation. EOG has key positions in the top domestic crude oil plays. We have tremendous reinvestment opportunities in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware Basin that will generate after-tax rates of return of 100% or greater at $80 WTI. We\u2019ve added a new chart to our presentation showing the minimum oil price that would be required to generate a 10% direct after-tax rate of return. At $40 oil, we would still achieve a 10% direct after-tax rate of return in the Eagle Ford, the Bakken/Three Forks and the Delaware plays. Our 2015 plan is to manage a balanced CapEx cash flow program, with CapEx plus dividends in line with cash flow. Our strategy will remain the same. EOG will be fiscally prudent with low net debt and a very strong balance sheet. At $80 oil, w should have sufficient cash flow to fully fund our Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware Basin plays and sustain double-digit oil growth through 2017 and beyond. We plan to invest in our highest return crude oil plays and reduce our activity in our combo plays. We still expect to be a leader in organic growth -- crude oil growth next year. The dividend continues to be a high priority. Our Board remains committed to increasing shareholder return through both high return production growth and dividend growth. Now let me conclude there are four important takeaways from this call. First, we talked about our key plays for a couple years, the Eagle Ford, Bakken, and Delaware Basin Leonard. Today\u2019s call has highlighted these three plays and our ability to improve our results with leading-edge completion technology. We continue to make better wells by lowering costs with self-sourced sand and drilling efficiencies. Our excellent base of key plays keeps getting better. Second, as a result of continuous productivity improvement in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin, we have increased our oil growth target for the second time this year. Third, we continue to organically add new high return plays to our drilling portfolio as well as high grading existing plays through improved completions, enhanced targeting and the identification of sweet spots on our acreage. The second Bone Spring Sand and Delaware Wolfcamp oil plays are good examples of this strategy. Although we are expanding our portfolio, the Eagle Ford will remain our foundation, a high return production growth driver for many years. And finally, EOG is focused on returns and our large high-quality drilling portfolio still generates exceptional returns with $80 oil. With best-in-class horizontal crude oil assets and a strong balance sheet, EOG will continue to be a leader in absolute organic U.S. crude oil production growth in 2015 and beyond. Thanks for listening. And now, we will go to Q&A. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate - Bank of America : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for all the additional color on the presentation this morning. Bill, I have got one question on CapEx and maybe one for Billy on Permian. On CapEx you guys have become very well-known as living within cash flow. Obviously with the oil price down and given some fairy consistent production guidance for next year, how should we think about your spending relative to cash flow given your strong balance sheet? Do you intend to still live within cash flow or would you allow the spending to go up a little bit given the strength of your balance sheet? Bill Thomas : Yes, good morning, Doug. And thanks for the question. Next year we need to be thinking about continuing to have a very strong balance sheet. And as we talked about in opening remarks, our capital spending plus the dividend will be balanced our cash flow. So the discipline spending fundamentals of the company are not going to change, as we go forward. And we\u2019re only focused in reinvesting in highest return plays. And we are not really interested in exceeding cash flow by trying to accelerate production in the combo plays or certainly not the gas plays. Doug Leggate - Bank of America : So I guess just to be clear, I mean, I guess the overall level of activity though and the overall price environment, is it fair to assume that the overall drilling activity would have to slow? So I\u2019m guessing bigger wells but fewer wells if you see what I mean? Bill Thomas : Yeah. As we look just -- let's just assume, Doug, if we have an $80 oil environment next year we\u2019re going to be have enough cash flow to fully fund our Eagle Ford, Bakken and our Delaware program. So all of those programs generate in excess of 100% rate of return at $80 oil. What we would cut back on is the combo plays certainly the Barnett Combo, some of our drilling in South Texas, in the Mid-Continent, in East Texas and even in the Permian where we have the Wolfcamp Combo. We would not spend as much money in those. But we need to be thinking that we would fully fund the Eagle Ford, the Bakken and the Delaware Basin plays and that we would have very strong double-digit production growth next year, oil growth and we would continue to be a leader in organic oil growth in the U.S. Doug Leggate - Bank of America : Thanks for that. My follow-up hopefully, quickly is on Permian. I guess, first of all congratulations on your very strong results there. It\u2019s been underlying by the step-up in the rig count. But I think historically, you\u2019ve raised some question about infrastructure constraints. So I\u2019m just wondering with your move to four to eight rigs, do you not believe this result any restrictions on EOG or is that still an issue for the basin as a whole, now even there? Thank you. David Trice :  Doug, this is David. On the Permian, the great thing is we've got three plays there, they\u2019re all really high rate of return. And they\u2019re each slightly different. And so we've got a lot of options there as far as play selection. For instance, the Second Bone Spring Sand tends to be a lower QR play and so that gives us a lot of options, if there is any type of gas takeaway restrictions or anything. So we\u2019ve got a lot of options -- we\u2019ve got a lot of options on the marketing side. I\u2019ll let Lance follow up with the marketing question. Lance Terveen : Yeah, Doug, just to follow up on -- I mean, it\u2019s very encouraging on the midstream infrastructure that\u2019s going to be come online, especially over the next year or so. We\u2019ve really aligned ourselves with the new capacity that\u2019s going to be coming online. So it might be a little bit of potential as the new timing comes on. It could be a little tight, but we\u2019ve contracted ourselves and aligned ourselves with a lot of these midstream providers that we feel at this time are going to be in good shape. Doug Leggate - Bank of America : I appreciate the answers guys. Thank you. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our next question from Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets. Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets : Hey, guys. I was hoping that you could kind of talk to a little bit of a dynamics around your fourth quarter U.S. oil production guidance. Kind of looking at what you guys have laid out, my math is indicating about the 0 to 2% sequential oil growth in U.S. You guys did about 7% in the third quarter versus 2Q sequential growth. Can you maybe just kind of address why the lower growth on the fourth quarter? Bill Thomas : Yeah. Good morning, Doug -- I mean, Leo. That\u2019s a good question. Thank you for that. In the fourth quarter, our production growth is really highly predicated on timing of the completions. And so we have a good number of wells. The majority of the wells will come on very late in the quarter and most of them -- a lot of them will be in December. So when you bring them on late in the year, obviously they don\u2019t add as much impact to the quarter. Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. That\u2019s helpful for sure. I guess, in terms of the Permian plays, it looks like you guys certainly have made a step forward there recently. I guess couple just sort of quick questions around that. Just trying to get a sense of kind of what kind of inning you\u2019re in there? I mean obviously, you\u2019ve been at the Eagle Ford for quite a bit longer than the Delaware Basin. And additionally, can you maybe talk to potential improvements there that you might see down the road in EURs and well cost? And is there any potential to add more acreage? David Trice : Yeah. Leo, this is David. I would say on the Permian, we've been very deliberate on testing new zones and testing the extent to these other plays. And I would say, we\u2019re very early on. We\u2019re probably third or fourth inning if you want to put it in baseball terms. And so we\u2019re going to continue to aggressively test these new zones and the extent of these plays and test the spacing of these plays. And potentially, to go to your second part of your question, with oil prices at $8o there is potential going forward that we could add some acreage. Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets : That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : The next question is from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research : Hi. Good morning, everyone. There was an interesting inflation point coming in terms of free cash flows to you guys. And now we\u2019ve had this inflation point with the oil price. I think what you\u2019re saying clearly is that you will have trimmed back your CapEx in some of the more marginal areas. If oil prices were surprising the upside next year, would you be pushing perhaps towards generating free cash flow for cash return to shareholders? Or do you think you'd reaccelerate your activity? Thanks. Bill Thomas : Yeah. Thank you, Paul. Good morning. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research : Good morning. Bill Thomas : As we think about 2015, obviously our goal is to fully fund the Eagle Ford, Bakken and the Permian plays but those very high returns. But we\u2019re going to also continue to be very committed to the dividend and dividend growth. We\u2019ve had 15 years that we\u2019ve increased the dividend 16 times in 15 years and we don\u2019t expect that pattern to decrease as we go forward. So we're always focused on returning value to the shareholders through that way. Obviously, with better prices next year that would help us to fully fund more drilling, but we\u2019re very confident even with the low price environment we\u2019re going to be able to have very strong double-digit growth going forward and continue to be a leader in U.S. organic production growth. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research : I guess, my point was you\u2019re already a leader in the organic production growth. Wouldn\u2019t you be now in the situation where at the margin you would be looking for even more rapid increases in cash return as opposed to extending your leading growth? Bill Thomas : Yeah. I think that\u2019s something that our Board will certainly consider as we go forward. And there obviously, as we look at the commodity price next year, the higher the price the more flexibility. We\u2019ll have to work on the dividend as well as increase drilling activity in some of other plays. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research : Sure. I\u2019ve got you. And then the second follow-up question is that we\u2019ve had an interesting announcement from BHP today with regards to exports. I assume it\u2019s not a coincidence at the same time as the Republicans taken control of the Senate. Can you just give your perspective on that move and what it means to you? Thank you. Lance Terveen : Hey, Paul. It\u2019s Lance. Obviously, we\u2019re closely watching everything that\u2019s going on out in the market. But a lot of what you\u2019re seeing is on ultralight oil, which is very high gravity condensate. And we look at our three big plays, essentially EOG has very, very little condensate. So we really have an ability to blend -- the condensating with our crude oil, so kind of a follow-up there. We are going to continue to watch it and strike as necessary? Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research : But the actual export is less relevant to you as such in terms of your own activity. Bill Thomas :  That\u2019s correct, Paul. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Joe Allman with J.P. Morgan. Joe Allman - J.P. Morgan: Thank you, Operator, and good early morning everybody. Bill Thomas : Good morning, Joe. Joe Allman - J.P. Morgan: So just a clarification on the plans for 2015 spending. So are you saying that you plan to spend within the cash flow from operations or potentially would you be contemplating some assets sales and help fund some CapEx? Bill Thomas : Yes, Joe. We are going to keep the cash flow in balance with the CapEx, plus the dividend. But also, we\u2019ve sold properties over the years and that is something that we will be considering next year also those. Obviously, the kind of non core properties, properties that will help us to be more efficient as the company reducing LOE cost and properties that don\u2019t have scale, that don\u2019t have maybe the potential of some of the others. So, yeah, that will be part of our plans next year is continue to sell additional properties. Joe Allman - J.P. Morgan: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then a follow-up. In the Eagle Ford, the high-density frac results were pretty impressive. So what are the main parameters around the high-density fracs that really give you that uplift from even, early this year production results? Bill Thomas : Yeah. These are new techniques, Joe, and they are experimental and really proprietary. So we don\u2019t want to give out a lot of details on what we are doing other than to say that we\u2019ve made significant improvement in distributing the frac more evenly along the lateral. And that has contacted more rock and we have this one example in our IR book. It\u2019s on slide 26. You may want to look at that in detail. But it shows 2014 wells, the kind of the current completion practices versus several of these high-density fracs in close proximity. The wells are in close proximity and there is a 39% increase in the first 60-days. So we are very excited about it. And we\u2019ve only completed high-density fracs on really kind of a handful of wells. So as we go forward, this gives us a lot of encouragement that there is still considerable room left to go in the Eagle Ford and really all this plays on improvements and completion technology. Joe Allman - J.P. Morgan: All right. Very impressive. Thank you, Bill. Operator : Our next question is from Bob Brackett with Sanford C. Bernstein. Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein: If we stayed in a lower crude price environment through next year, what would your interest be in acquiring distressed assets or operators that might be in trouble? Bill Thomas : Good morning, Bob. Yes, good question. EOG is our focus and our success has been really generating new potential through organic exploration and we see no lack of opportunity in that direction. And those were able to generate -- we generated five new plays this year. And we have a good list going forward that we have -- we are hopeful, we will be good addition to the company at very low cost. And so the acquisition businesses as you all know, historically, there is a lot of competition in M&As and acquisitions and usually they turn out to be very, very low return. So we are going continue to maintain our focus on growing the company organically through exploration and low-cost, acreage acquisitions in that process Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay. Thanks. And you\u2019ve had a couple competitors talk about East Taxes a bit more in the last quarter. You\u2019ve got a position up there, how does that stack in your portfolio or is it still too early to know? Bill Thomas : Bob. That\u2019s again a yes. It's too early to know there. And we as everybody knows, we are drilling wells there and we are testing concepts. And when we have meaningful results on that, we will be able to update everybody on. But it\u2019s still really early and as we\u2019ve talked about before, we have a very high cutoff because our asset quality is so strong in the company. We are not interested in going forward with plays that would generate less than a 50% return. So we are working on only plays and spending a lot of money in going forward with very high-quality play. So we are taking our time and we\u2019ll let everybody know when we have some meaningful results. Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein: Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities. Irene Haas - Wunderlich Securities : Yes. Hey, guys. This is really interesting. So it\u2019s becoming sort of a mining operation. So, I am curious as to, as you continue to improve these resource plays, for example in the Eagle Ford, what percent recovery we are up to, like right now our with your assessments? Bill Thomas : Yeah. Good morning, Irene. In the Eagle Ford, we have quit giving a percent recovery factor there because we are still, I think trying to relook at what the oil in places there. But it\u2019s certainly going up all the time. And we continue, as we showed and demonstrated in some of the charts and we\u2019ve talked about this morning. We continue to make very significant increases in the completion technology and being able just to contact more rock along the lateral and keep the contact closer to the wellbore, so that we can drill additional wells closer together as you go forward, and So we think we are in about the sixth inning in the Eagle Ford and so there is a lot of room left to go there. Irene Haas - Wunderlich Securities : Great. If I have one follow-up, I\u2019m going to hit you up on your macro view in this very volatile time? Bill Thomas : Are you talking about the price of oil? Irene Haas - Wunderlich Securities : Yeah. Oil, gas, yeah because usually you guys would have few lines on that. Bill Thomas : Yeah. We are pretty good at some things, but the world oil supply demand situation is not an area that we have a lot of expertise in. And a special insight and we read a lot of the same reports and follow the same analytics that many of you do and we are going to kind of leave it up to them, to kind of give direction to others, a lot of opinions out there on what oil prices could do. Irene Haas - Wunderlich Securities : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company. Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company: Good morning. Bill Thomas : Good morning, Pearce. Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company: What level of flexibility do you have regarding oil services like rigs and completion crudes, et cetera, in your contracts if you need to adjust activity in a low oil price environment? Bill Thomas : Yes, Pears. Good question. We have about 33%, about a third of our frac spreads are under long-term contracts. And about 50% of our drilling rigs are under long-term contracts companywide. So we have a lot of flexibility to lower activity, if we need to or increase activity if that is wanted. And we also have a lot of flexibility to take advantages of any kind of price decreases that may happen and we are already beginning to see especially in the frac equipment business and we are already seeing some price reductions and certainly, if prices stay at these levels, we could see a bit more that going forward. Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company: Thank you. And then my follow-up, is under a low oil price environment, will you prioritize away from exploration and focus more on development? And then, as a leader, how do you balance the need for exploration to drive future growth of the company with lower cash flows and the need to maybe focus on development? Bill Thomas : On that, Pearce, as we go forward and if we stay in a fairly low price environment, we don\u2019t really expect to pullback on much of our exploration efforts, because they are really, really low cost. Our entry cost on these plays is extremely low because we are upfront in areas where nobody really else is looking. So we don\u2019t expect to have a significant pullback on that. We are generating significant amount of new inventory each year. This year we\u2019ve generated two times the amount of drilling inventory that we\u2019ve actually drilled this year, some of that, of course, is in the existing plays, but again, already generated in new plays too. So the company is a very prolific organic prospect generating machine. And we think it\u2019s -- we can continue to do that as very, very low cost. As we -- in the last few years our exploration costs have been relatively low in the company and a very small part of our budget. Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company: Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Arun Jayaram of Credit Suisse. Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse :  Good morning. Bill, I wanted to get your thoughts on the overall development strategy from here in the Eagle Ford? I know you have 6,000 locations, you\u2019re drilling 520, 540 wells per annum? So I just wanted to get your thoughts on how you develop it from here? I guess, the reason I ask that question is I have noted that you have down shifted activity in the last couple of quarters in Gonzales County. And perhaps, increase some activity on the western side of the play (indiscernible). So just trying to get some thoughts on, how do you move playing on the rigs news, et cetera? Bill Thomas : Yeah. Good morning, Arun. Thank you for that question. As we go forward, the mix of wells in the Eagle Ford will be relatively what they have been in the last several quarters. And in the third quarter, it is about 52% of wells were in the west and 48% were in the east. And as we look going forward that mix will stay about the same. We did drill in the third quarter some retention wells and holding some of that acreage that with the kind of classify this that less than 60% a-tax rate of return kind of acreage. So we just drilled the initial wells on that to hold that, we don\u2019t plan on developing that acreage anytime soon going forward, but we wanted to hold it. But just directionally, the mix of well should be relatively consistent with what we\u2019ve been doing in the last several quarters. Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse : Okay. Just to clarify that, Bill. Q3, perhaps, the mix of wells was towards a lower rate of return then typical on lease retention and you expect that to normalize maybe going forward, is that fair? Bill Thomas : Yes. We drilled 28 wells to do lease, excuse me, lease retention in some of those lower returns acreage in the third quarter and going forward, we don\u2019t have that many wells planned to do that going forward. So that will drop off as we go forward. Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse : That\u2019s very helpful. My follow-up Bill, you\u2019ve talked about expanding opportunity set in the Delaware, you\u2019re moving from four to eight rigs by year end. So just wanted to ask you, do you think you have the appropriate level of scale in the Delaware, are there opportunities through leasing, where you like to get a little bit bigger in the Delaware? David Trice :  Yeah. Arun, this is David. And we have got -- we have laid out the three big plays that we announced today. And those -- we have numerous locations in those. We have many, many years of drilling just in those plays. And like I said before, we\u2019ve been very delivered about testing new ideas and continuing to push the boundaries of these existing plays. So, I think, we have plenty of scale there in the Delaware Basin. Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse : Thank you very much. Operator :  And we\u2019ll take the next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs : Thanks. Good morning. Bill Thomas : Good morning, Brian. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs : Without trying to tie you down to your production or CapEx guidance from next year. In the plays you do plan to focus on Eagle Ford, the Bakken, the Delaware Basin? Can you run through, how you see required spending from HBP or infrastructure versus discretionary spending evolving next year i.e. what efficiency gains do you see on the horizon or you could keep the growth engine running without having spend as much capital and perhaps, some estimate for how much capital that that could represent? Bill Thomas : Yeah, Brian. Thanks for the question. As far as acreage retention or explorations, we have very little requirements in that area. For example, this year, at the end of the year in the Eagle Ford will be 80% of our acreage is HBP and by the end of 2015 it will be 95%. So the actual retention drilling in the Eagle will be less next year than it is this year. And then in the Permian we have just a little bit that we have to do for retention drilling and in the Bakken it\u2019s all held our production. So we have a lot of flexibility to make sure that we are focusing on drilling and on high return. And so there was another part of your question, you have to remind me again, what was that? Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs : Yeah. Infrastructure, just a bit of the same question for infrastructure and each of those areas, do you see your infrastructure needs to support growth rising or falling? Bill Thomas : Yeah. No. That\u2019s a good question. We see, I think, next year a bit less spending in infrastructure than we did this year. Because, again, a lot of the infrastructure this year was in the Eagle Ford and we were doing a lot of step out or retention drilling and we have to build out through that, is that by fault, the need for infrastructure is less. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs : Great. Thanks. And then, if well performance is driving your stronger than guided your production results, do you see your rates of return in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware improving as a result and in each of those areas, how much would you attribute to greater first year production versus greater overall recoveries versus better production mix? Bill Thomas : Yes. As the well productivity increases with the completion designs, it is very additive to the return. So as you bring the oil, obviously, forward quicker, the returns go up and we are also able to continue to lower costs at the same time too and be more efficient in that area. So, rates of return given the confident commodity price are improving. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs : And to your point you are pushing up production earlier on with the completion technique, with -- which might be a little bit different than you are recovering more overall? Billy Helms : Yeah. I think the, Brian, this is Billy Helms. I think I would also add to that is, yeah, Bill is right, the rate of return is certainly increasing, we are increasing the initial production rates too, but we are also increasing the recoveries of the wells. So, overall, recovery is going up too. So we are not just accelerating early time production at the sake of longer term production. We are seeing an uplift of overall curve. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs : Great. Thank you. Operator : We will go next to David Tameron with Wells Fargo Securities. David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities : Hi. Good morning Bill. Question, can you guys talk about what you -- how you complete these wells in the Permian. I know you had one of those little yellow boxes on one of the slides, you talked about your advance completion technology. So I imagine you don\u2019t want to give all the secrets but can you give us like same framework around the way you complete this? Bill Thomas : Yeah, David, in the Permian, just like we do in all the other plays, it\u2019s a constant experiment. Eagle Ford, you\u2019ve seen a track record that we had there. We just continue to experiment and to push this. So lot of the techniques that we\u2019ve learned in these other plays have been applied in Permian. Like Bill mentioned earlier, we don\u2019t want to give out any specific details on that but we do spend a lot of time experimenting with each play and each plays a little bit different. But we\u2019ve got a good process in place. David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities : Any reason that the 4500 plus lateral versus longer laterals, you should have got to that yet or just -- is there anything you comment on that, is that your larger curve. Could you talk about that? Bill Thomas : Your question is why don\u2019t we drill longer laterals? David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities : Yeah. Have you tried the longer laterals? And it seems like just most of the stuff you mentioned at least in the slide that was on the shorter 4500 foot? Bill Thomas : I mean, each play is different and so we\u2019ve done longer laterals both in the Delaware and in the Midland Basin. And it just depends on the cost of drilling, the added footage and then also the performance of the wells. And so what we\u2019ve generally seen is at least they are in the Delaware Basin that we tend to prefer to go with, more with 5,000 to 4500 foot lateral. It also helps -- it tends to be kind of the resized configuration as well. David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. And then just back to the Eagle Ford, I think it was Bill that you mentioned RSC data. Can you give us any framework just around what the Eagle Ford is doing as far as overall basin production quarter-over-quarter sequentially or can you give us anything along those lines? Bill Thomas : David, no, I don\u2019t have that in front of me right now. We have to get back with you on that. You\u2019re talking about the whole field for all operators. David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities : Yeah -- no, just for your specific Eagle Ford. I mean, there is so much concern about Eagle Ford production levels. I was just looking for some -- directionally, there are some type of comfort I guess you gave us on your end? Bill Thomas : Yeah. No, I mean, again we\u2019ve talked about -- we\u2019ve got a 10-year growth profile in the Eagle Ford as we go forward. And we\u2019re on target for that, pretty consistent. We\u2019re drilling 540 wells this year and again, the mix of wells that we drill going forward will be relatively the same. So we\u2019re planning a long-term growth profile there. David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities : All right. I\u2019ll go back there. Thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles Meade - Johnson Rice : Good morning Bill and to the rest of your team there. Bill Thomas : Good morning. Charles Meade - Johnson Rice : I was wondering if I could go back to the Three Forks and get you guys to maybe decompose a bit, that the results you\u2019re seeing there and what I\u2019m really curious about in the end, is there any chance for the Three Forks. I know it\u2019s already pretty high in the stack of your play but is there a chance forward to move higher and get bigger. And I guess, the little bit of detail to add there is the rates you gives have on those main three wells are good but they will be more impressive when you look at the lateral lengths you guys had on them. And as I understand the lot of Three Forks is kind of being puzzling the people and some times there is undifferentiated log responses, hard to predict, what\u2019s going to be good, what\u2019s not. So can you talk about what the prospects for that to grow in your portfolio are? Billy Helms : Yeah, Charles, this is Billy Helms. On the Three Forks, we\u2019re probably going a little bit slower than we are, relative to the Bakken. Most of our activity in that area will be focused on Bakken because that is what we consider the higher rate of return, the more consistent development play in that program. In the Three Forks, however, we do realize the potential in that play and we are anxious to get some more test. And as you can see, what the results we\u2019ve had this quarter, they are all testing out fairly strong. Let\u2019s say we\u2019re still delineating what the ultimate extent of that play will be across our acreage position and what each zone will contribute across the acreage position. So I think we\u2019re still a little bit early in that play. And again, most of our activity will be focused on the Bakken as we go forward. I think there is -- we're certainly pleased with the upside we see there. And we will continue to test that with some encouragement from these wells. Charles Meade - Johnson Rice : Thank you, Billy. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Matt Portillo with TPH. Matt Portillo - TPH: Good morning. Bill Thomas : Good morning, Matt. Matt Portillo - TPH: Just two quick questions for me. My first question revolves around your international asset basis. Wondering if you could give us an update on your thoughts around the East Irish Sea and the production potential coming on stream in 2015? Bill Thomas : Yeah, on our Conwy project, that\u2019s going to coming on in the second quarter of 2015. And what we expect there is that we\u2019ll have a kind of ramp-up phase and probably max out at around about 20,000 barrels a day for couple of months there. Matt Portillo - TPH: Great. And then, I guess, just back on the CapEx question. As we look at your programs for 2014, is there any color you could provide us in terms of the capital you\u2019re spending currently this year on assets outside of the main three you talked about the Eagle Ford, the Delaware, and the Bakken, maybe that would help us with some other context as we head into 2015 from an expectation perspective? Bill Thomas : Matt, we have active drilling programs or one rig program in the Barnett Combo. We have a rig or two running in the mid-continent. A couple of rigs running in the East Texas and a couple of rigs running in South Texas. So we do have activity this year outside the Eagle Ford, the Bakken and the Permian plus we also as we talked about early in the year of these new plays in the Rockies, we\u2019re running a rig or two in the Powder River. And I believe we\u2019re running two rigs in the DJ. Actually there is four rigs in the DJ Basin. So we have quite a bit of activity in plays outside of the core plays. Matt Portillo - TPH: Thank you very much. It\u2019s very helpful. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to today\u2019s speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Bill Thomas : Well, thank you very much for listening and for your continued support. And I just like to say and concluding that we\u2019re confident as we head into 2015 and been with the company for 35 years. Every time we go to one of these price cycles, EOG outperforms and we come out of that price cycle in better shape than we entered it. So the company is in great shape with a sweet spot and the best role is on the plays in the U.S. and along with our low cost in our industry-leading technology. EOG is going to be strong performer in the yeas to come and a leader in the U.S. oil growth. So again thank you for listening. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation.",

Good day and welcome to the EOG Resources\u2019 Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir. Tim Driggers : Good morning, and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable reserves, as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website. Participating on the call this morning are, Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Gary Thomas, Chief Operating Officer; Billy Helms, EVP, Exploration and Production; David Trice, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, VP, Marketing; and Cedric Burgher, Senior VP, Investor and Public Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening and we included guidance for the first quarter and full year 2015 in yesterday's press release. This morning we will discuss topics in the following order. Bill Thomas will review 2014 highlights and our 2015 capital plan, David Trice and Billy Helms will review operational results and year-end reserve replacement data. Then I\u2019ll discuss EOG's financials, capital structure and hedge position, and Bill will provide concluding remarks. Now here is Bill Thomas. Bill Thomas : Thank you, Tim. 2014 was another record year for EOG. Our results continue to demonstrate our return-focused capital discipline and EOG\u2019s superior ability to apply technology to the exploration and development of [tight] plays. Here are the highlights. Number one, EOG demonstrated its capital efficiency by earnings peer leading returns. ROE for 2014 was 16% and ROCE was 14%. For the year we increased crude oil production by 31% driven by our top three oil plays, the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware Basin. NGL production increased 23% and natural gas production held flat, yielding total company production growth of 17%. We announced five new plays, four in the Rockies, DJ and Powder River Basins, and the Second Bone Spring Sand play on the Delaware basin side of the Permian. These plays add flexibility to our portfolio of options to grow production in the coming years. Also in the Delaware Basin we identified an oil window in our existing Wolfcamp acreage. Early in 2014, we increased the reserve potential in the Eagle Ford to 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent to 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent net to EOG. Between that Eagle Ford reserve increase and the new Rockies play alone, we added 1.4 billion barrels of potential reserves to our portfolio and 2300 high return net drilling locations. In recent years, we have consistently added twice as many locations as we drilled. Finally EOG remained laser focused on cost by driving down per well expenses in all of our major plays while simultaneously driving up well productivity. Before I move on to 2015 I would like to expand on that last highlight. We have demonstrated a unique ability to get the most out of tight oil plays from both a cost and well productivity standpoint. Over the last 10 years, we have developed expertise over all the disciplines required to drill in shale and other tight rocks and make that drilling highly economical. This proven ability is why we posted strong returns in 2014, and why we are so well positioned to not only weather the current low price environment, but to take advantage of it. So now let us talk about EOG\u2019s goals for 2015. First, our overarching goal this year is to prepare for oil price recovery. It is clear that current prices are too low to meet the world\u2019s supply needs and the market will rebalance. We would be ready to respond swiftly when oil prices improve and resume our leadership and high return oil growth. Second, we do not believe that growing oil in what could turn out to be a short cycle low price environment is the right thing to do. And let me repeat, we do not believe that growing oil in what could turn out to be a short cycle low price environment is the right thing to do. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet at today\u2019s scrip prices. 2015 cash flows should fund our CapEx budget of approximately $5 billion. Third, returns are what matter. Therefore we will focus capital on the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware Basin plays. At $55 oil, these premier assets deliver a direct after-tax rate of return greater than 35% without factoring in the potential for additional service cost reductions. I will now explain in further detail how we plan to prepare for the oil price recovery. First, we will reduce average rigs 50% down to 27% for 2015 and intentionally delay any of our completions, building a significant inventory of approximately 350 uncompleted wells. This allows EOG to use rigs under existing commitments and when prices improve we will be poised to ramp up completions. Oil price improvement of even a few dollars generates incremental MPV. So delaying completions and wait for improved prices as evidenced by the forward curve will add significant value. Please see Slide 8 of our investor presentation for a play specific example. Second, we remain focused on driving down finding costs and improving per well production rates. This is our best hedge against low oil prices. For example, as a result of cost and oil productivity improvements in the Eagle Ford Western acreage, we can now generate better returns with $65 oil than we did with $95 oil just two or three years ago. We illustrate this on Slide 11 of the investor presentation. Due to low oil prices we have already seen service cost reductions in many areas and see the potential for 10% to 30% vendor savings during this downturn. Additionally, every one of our plays has room to reduce cost further through ongoing efficiency gains. We believe our integrated approach to completion technology is industry leading. Quarter after quarter we make improvements to well productivity and that will continue to be a high priority this year for EOG. Third, low oil prices mean unique opportunities to add low-cost, high-quality acreage. We will continue to grow our acreage portfolio through leasehold, farm-in or tactical acquisitions. We view our strong balance sheet and excess liquidity as a strategic asset for opportunities in times like these. We are already benefiting from the oil down cycle, adding new leases at lower cost than last year and we are optimistic that additional opportunities will become available. Finally in my 36 years with the company I have seen many downturns, and each time EOG stays disciplined, performs well and emerges on the other side in better shape than we entered it. in 2015, EOG plans to build a stronger position and be ready to resume long-term, high return production growth when prices improve. I will now address the Eagle Ford. David Trice will discuss the Permian Basin and Billy Helms will provide an update on the Bakken and Rockies plays along with a review of our year-end reserves. 2014 was another remarkable year in Eagle Ford. Oil production from the play increased 45% and EOG achieved several key milestones. Number one, down spacing and improved completion techniques enabled us to increase our total potential reserve estimate in 2014 by 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent to 3.2 billion barrels equivalent net to EOG. We continue to advance our technical expertise as evidenced by ongoing improvements in productivity across the field. Slide 17 in our updated investor presentation shows an 8% increase in productivity for wells completed in 2014 versus 2013. We continue our progress with high density completions across the entire play. A high density completion is simply various techniques used to maximize the amount of rock connected to the well bore. Due to geologies those techniques will change from one county to the next and we are making progress determining how to tweak those techniques across our acreage. Number four, after five years in the Eagle Ford we are still making drilling time and cost improvements. Please see Slide 18 in the investor presentation. And number five, at the end of 2014 our acreage in the Eagle Ford was over 80% held by production. We had a number of lease retention commitments in our Western acreage that we successfully fulfilled in 2014, bringing up drilling flexibility going forward. Eagle Ford activity in 2015 will continue to be balanced between the West and East sides of the field. As I mentioned we are intentionally delaying completions while we wait for improved [oil prices]. Thus our inventory of uncompleted well is expected to increase. This strategy allows us to maximize the value of our existing contractual commitments while waiting on improved pricing before we bring on newly completed wells with high oil production rates. Delaying completions will also provide an opportunity to take advantage of lower service costs that will likely materialize in the coming months. The Eagle Ford remains EOG\u2019s premier play. We have about 5500 net oils to drill on our acreage, and over 10 years of inventory. The Eagle Ford represents a huge call option on oil that EOG can exercise at any time to take advantage of a favorable oil price environment. We often refer to the Eagle Ford as our technology laboratory. Our understanding of this field and how to increase its recovery rate has led to improvements in plays across the entire company. The first to benefit from this technology transfer was the Bakken beginning in late 2012, and now the Permian Basin is experiencing the latest step change in our application of technology. I will now turn it over to David Trice to discuss activities in the Permian. David Trice : Thanks, Bill. In 2015 EOG\u2019s capital budget in the Permian will expand to take advantage of new Delaware Basin targets, advancements in well performance and cost reductions achieved in 2014. If you will recall, last year we shifted capital from the Midland Basin to the Delaware Basin, which allowed us to advance our technical understanding of the Delaware. In 2015, we will have fewer drilling commitments to hold acreage in the Midland Basin, which frees up capital and provides more flexibility. Let us quickly review the 2014 achievements that set this play up to be major contributor to EOG\u2019s returns and long-term growth. First we made significant advancements in our most mature oil play in the Delaware Basin, the Leonard Shale, by increasing oil productivity 17%. In 2015 we will continue to push wells closer together, developing and further testing down to 300 feet. We are encouraged with the initial results and expect to see further advancements throughout the year. Second, in our Delaware Basin Wolfcamp play we made great progress in 2014 as the play moved into development mode. We greatly increased well productivity as evidenced by the three wells we highlight in our press release. At $7 million completed well cost, the Wolfcamp play delivers very strong returns. Also in the Wolfcamp during 2014 we identified and delineated 90,000 new acres in the oil window. Third, we tested and improved the second Bone Spring Sand to be another high return oil direct in our Delaware Basin acreage. Initial results were promising, and we did extensive G&G work to delineate this play. The second Bone Spring Sand produced 70% oil in our Red Hills acreage in Mexico, and promises returns on par with our premier oil plays. We will move the second Bone Spring Sand into development mode this year and it will receive the largest relative increase in capital. In summary, the Leonard Shale is in full development mode and continues to deliver impressive results. The Delaware Basin Wolfcamp finished its first year of development drilling, the wells are outstanding and the costs are dropping and we are excited to have the second Bone Spring Sand to the drilling program and bring it forward into full development mode. We are confident that we will see the same progress in the second Bone Spring Sand that we have seen from the Leonard Shale over the last two years. While the Delaware Basin is still in the early innings of its exploration and development, the returns we are already generating from multiple targets to make it very competitive with Eagle Ford and the Bakken.  Billy Helms will now discuss the Bakken, the Rockies and year-end reserves. Billy Helms : Thanks David. 2014 was a successful year for the Bakken program. We began down spacing, testing various spacing patterns and continued experimenting with completion techniques to improve the performance of the field. Here are some of the highlights for 2014 activity. First we made significant advancements in improving drilling times and reducing well cost. A typical 10,000 foot lateral is now drilled in just over 10 days with a completed well cost of $9.3 million. This represents a cost reduction of 11% from 2013, and we expect more efficiency gains and service cost reductions in the current environment. Second, we now have production data from each of the various spacing patterns and began to determine the optimal development plan. We have tested wells at 1300 foot, 700 foot and 500 foot spacing patterns and have just started producing oils in the 300 foot spacing pattern. Similar to the Eagle Ford, we expect that the spacing will vary depending on the specific rock characteristics in each area of the field. One of our latest test is a 6 well pattern with wells spaced 700 feet apart in the Bakken core. The initial production rates of these wells range from 1000 barrels of oil per day to 1900 barrels of oil per day and represent a customized completion design tailored for the rock properties in this particular area of the field.  Third, we are confident that there is a significant amount of remaining potential in the Bakken, and that down spacing will be highly economic. As I mentioned earlier, evaluating the production from each spacing pattern will lead us to the appropriate spacing and the ultimate reserve potential. While the Bakken will receive less capital in 2015 it remains a core, high return asset in our drilling program. A typical 10,000 foot lateral in the Bakken core generates greater than 35% after tax rate of return with a $55 flat oil price. In addition, maintaining activity allows us to retain momentum on operational efficiencies. For example, we recently drilled an 18,600 foot well to total depth in just over seven days. We continue to believe that EOG has the premier acreage position in the play with many years of development drilling remaining and the potential for long-term production growth. In the DJ Basin EOG made significant progress in both the Codell and Niobrara. We\u2019ve been experimenting with web or targeting inter well spacing and modifications to the completion design for both intervals. For the Codell, we\u2019ve identified a specific statrographic interval within the pay section that when targeted rightly enhances the performances of the well. The improved completion techniques we used are even more effective when we focus o this target. Please see our press release for notable well results. Back to Codell we\u2019ve tested several targets within the Niobrara. With this additional testing we\u2019ve determined a correlation between the amount of lateral focused within a specific target interval and the protection performance of the well. In 2014, we made progress in several areas that contributed to reaching our well and operating cost wells in the DJ Basin. These include drilling and completion efficiencies and oil and gas gathering system and water gathering and distribution system and the infrastructure needed to obtain EOG self-source sand. Our activity in the 2015 in the DJ Basin will be limited, drilling wells needed to maintain leasehold and finishing completion operations on a few remaining wells drilled last year. The Powder River Basin is stack pay system we\u2019ve drilled primarily in apartment and tunnel oil reservoirs similar to other areas within EOG\u2019s portfolio. In 2014, we focused on well targeting and completion designs and inter well spacing to determine the optimal development plan. We made significant improvements in all aspects during 2014. Please see our press release for some excellent fourth quarter well results in both department and internal place. We plan to have limited activity in the Powder River Basin in 2015 while we wait for commodity prices to improve. I\u2019ll now address reserve replacements and planning cost. Excluding revisions due to commodity price changes, we replaced 249% of our 2014 production at a low planning cost of $13.25 per Boe. Proved reserves increased 18% and more than half of our reserve growth was driven by proved. In addition net proved developed reserves increased 20%. For the 27 consecutive year, the DeGolyer and MacNaughton did an independent engineering analysis of our reserves. And their estimate was within 5% of our internal estimate. Their analysis covered about 76% of our proved reserves this year. Please see the schedules accompanying the earnings press release for the calculation of reserve replacements and finding cost. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure. Tim Driggers : Thanks Billy. Let me start by addressing an unusual item affecting the fourth quarter. In early December we announced the sale of most of our producing assets in Canada, the proceeds of approximately of $400 million. As a result volumes were lower than our previous guidance for the fourth quarter by approximately 2,300 barrels of oil per day and 15 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. Also G&A for the quarter was higher due to $21.5 million of exit costs related to the sale. Now, I\u2019d like to make a few comments about our capital spending last year and in the fourth quarter. Capitalized interest for the quarter was $14.5 million, for the fourth quarter 2014, total expirations and development expenditures were $1.8 billion excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plans and other property plant and equipment were $140 million. There were $66 million of acquisitions during the quarter. For the full year 2014, capitalized interest was $57.2 million. Total expiration and development expenditures were $7.6 billion excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition expenditures for gathering systems, processing plans and other property plant and equipment were $727 million. For the full year capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations were $8.3 billion. Total cash flow from operations was $8.6 billion exceeding total cash expenditures. In addition proceeds from asset sales were $569 million. Total acquisitions for the year were $139 million. At year-end total debt outstanding was $5.9 million for debt to total capitalization ratio of 25%. Taking into $2.1 billion of cash on hand at year-end, net debt to total cap was 18%, down from 23% at year end 2013. In the fourth quarter of 2014, total impairments were $536 million, $445 million of these impairments were the result of significant declines in commodity prices during the fourth quarter. For the full year 2014, total impairments were $744 million, $501 million of these impairments result the declines in commodity prices and negotiated sales prices of property sales. The remaining impairments for both the fourth quarter and full year 2014 were ongoing lease and producing property impairments. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 61% and the deferred tax ratio was 104%. Yesterday we included a guidance table with our earnings press release for the first quarter and full year 2015. Our 2015 CapEx estimate is $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion excluding acquisitions. The expiration and development portion excluding facilities will account for approximately 80% of the total CapEx budget. 2015 CapEx represents a 40% decrease from 2014. As Bill mentioned earlier, we\u2019re not interested in growing oil production in a low price environment. The budget for expiration and development facilities accounts for approximately 12% of the total CapEx budget for 2015 and midstream accounts for 8%, we plan to concentrate our spending on infrastructure in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin to support our drilling programs in those areas and enhance operating efficiencies. In terms of hedges, for February 1 thru June 30, 2015 we\u2019ve 47,000 barrels of oil per day hedged at $91.22 per barrel. For the second half of 2015, we\u2019ve 10,000 barrels of oil per day hedged at $89.98 per barrel. This represents a small portion of our estimated oil production in 2015 and we\u2019ll look to hedge further volumes opportunistically throughout the year. We\u2019ve contracts outstanding for 37,000 barrels of oil per day that could be put to us at various terms. Please see the press release for further details. For natural gas, we\u2019ve 182,000 MMBtu per day hedged at $4.51 per MMBtu for March 1 thru December 31, 2015. We also have a number of contracts on natural gas that could be put to us at various terms. The counter parties exercised also its options, the notion of volume of EOG\u2019s existing natural gas derivative contracts were increased by 175,000 MMBtu per day at an average price of $4.51 per MMBtu for each month during the period March 1 thru December 31, 2015. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Bill. Bill Thomas : Thanks Tim. Now, I\u2019ll talk about the macro view. We\u2019re encouraged that Congress is taking a look at lifting a ban on crude oil exports. Doing so will bring a lot of range of economic geopolitical benefits including strengthening the U.S. energy sector, growing the U.S. economy, creating jobs, dramatically improving the U.S. trade deficit, providing our European allies with more secure supplies and lowering gasoline process to U.S. consumers. As I mentioned earlier EOG will be very focused this year on preparing for the recovery in oil process. The current supply demand imbalance is not very large and current process are far short of what is necessary to sustain the supply need to meet world demand growth. When process recover, EOG will be prepared to resume strong double-digit oil growth. For now, EOG is intentionally choosing returns over growth. In fact that's the way it\u2019s always been here at EOG. In summary, I want to leave you with some important summary points. Year in, year out, EOG consistently approaches capital planning by focusing on returns. 2015 is no different. Second, we\u2019ve halted production growth deliberately while EOG is one of the few companies that can earn a healthy return at today's oil prices we are not interested in growing oil into our low price environment. As we compare today\u2019s oil prices to our expectations for a more balanced market, it makes economic sense to slow production until an industry wide supply response is realized and prices respond accordingly. This strategy maximizes the value of our assets and it\u2019s the right strategy to create long term shareholder value. Third, our balance sheet places EOG in a strong position. We intend to use our financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities to grow our inventory by acquiring low cost, high quality acreage. And fourth, with the substantial inventory up high volume levels to complete, we will be ready to return to double-digit oil growth as oil prices improve. And finally, we fully expect to merge the commodity price down cycle and the stronger position that we entered in. In 2015, we have more opportunity than ever to lower finding costs and development costs and improve returns in 2016 and beyond. Thanks for listening and now we will go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is open please check your mute function. And we will take our next question from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey : Hi, good morning everybody. Can you hear me okay? Bill Thomas : Yes Paul go ahead. Paul Sankey : Good morning. You have clearly stated guys that you are now targeting flat year-over-year crude production in 2015 and that you also stated clearly that you\u2019re not interested in growing oil production in a low oil price environment. I wanted to confirm that the overarching decision that you have made here is to get CapEx in line with expected cash flows and secondly by increasing efficiency allowing for lowest service cost that even if oil prices remain low for another year you would be able to deliver growth in 2016 while keeping CapEx within cash flows or if oil prices remain low which you reduce the CapEx and leave volumes flat again next year? Thanks. Bill Thomas : Yes Paul that \u2013 the first statement is generally correct. Number one, we do not think it\u2019s wise or prudent to accelerate oil when oil prices are low especially if the rebound and price could come certainly in the next \u2013 this year, the end of this year or maybe even next year. So, there is no use in trying to accelerate. It makes much more prudent business decision to wait and that will give us a much more capital returns if we do that and we are very committed to maintain the very strong balance sheet, so we don't want to out-spend trying to grow oil in a low price environment. And we want to keep our balance sheet clean and low and we want to keep our patter drop so that we will be able to take some advantage of what could be some unique opportunities in this downturn. 2016, yes if we \u2013 if things go as we think they might could and we would have say a $65 oil environment in 2016 and we believe that we could return to our very strong double-digit oil growth that we have been marching towards a last few years and that we will be able to generate very high rates of return on our capital and we would be able to stay free cash flow neutral. Paul Sankey : And I guess, the specific part of that was that if you \u2013 another year $5 billion CapEx next year you would be able to re-accelerate growth because of the increased efficiencies and lower service cost that you will be seeing throughout this year? Bill Thomas : Certainly, we do think costs will come down this year due to services and again efficiency gains, we\u2019re making really good progress in that and as we look forward to 2016 we haven't set a capital goal on that yet and we will look at that when we get there. Paul Sankey : Okay. That's great. Thanks and then can I just confirm you are building effectively an inventory of stuff that you can do if you want to, would that mean you are less likely to add into M&A or would you not follow that statement through? Bill Thomas : Well, the kind of opportunities that we are looking for is take advantage of is number one, this low cost environment. It helps us to pick up acreage that we are working on in our certainly our core areas. We are able to pickup 11,000 acres last year in the Eagle Ford and we are targeting to pick up more there just on leasehold so that goes more easily this year. The second is we have historically and we do think that we will have opportunities to earn acreage through farmings or drill to earn top things commitments and we will look for partners that we can join in with that will be a win-win situation and earn acreage in our core areas and maybe some emerging areas. And then, we look for topical acquisitions that won\u2019t be the large, large acquisitions that they will be certainly bolt on acreage and they will be opportunities that we see primarily in our top tier place. Paul Sankey : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And we will take our next question from Phillip Jungwirth with BMO. Phillip Jungwirth : Yes, good morning. EOG has been the cutting edge of completion technology and proven to be a premiere operator, but is there any way to quantify the operational synergy you think can be achieved during acquisition strategy in terms of MPB or how big you think it\u2019s best to think about it and can this technology advantage be maintained in a way that's accretive through acquisitions? Bill Thomas : Yes Phillip, thank you for the question. I think certainly when we look at potential acquisitions, the thing we let help guide that is our expiration expertise and our understanding of the locks and so we really are only focused on that kind of opportunities where we see very sweet spot top acreage and use existing core areas or in emerging place. And then, we certainly have a lot of expertise and we\u2019ve been in the shale business I think longer than most people and we developed a very strong efficiencies and technology improvements and we think that we would certainly bring that to bear. And we apply that and the upside that we see on that that we could bring the table on any kind of acquisition that we might pursue. Also we\u2019ve certainly our built-in cost of reductions, mechanisms like our self-sourced sand and other materials that we use in our fracs, so that gives an advantage from an economic standpoint to be competitive on acquisitions. Phillip Jungwirth : Thank you. And how much of the 2015 capital being spent isn\u2019t additive to production this year just solely due to the decision to defer completion during the year just so we can get a sense of what a clean number on a capital efficiency basis would be? Tim Driggers : Okay. As for as the number of wells that we\u2019re deferring really the number is we had 200 wells at the start of 2015 and we\u2019re going to end the year with about 285 wells waiting on completion. So they have additional 85 wells and were we complete that that cost would be somewhere $250 million to $500 million. But, as far as the wells that we\u2019re drilling and not to be completed that\u2019s a couple of 100 million additional costs that we\u2019re spending this year, 2015. Phillip Jungwirth : Great, thanks a lot. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : Yes, good morning to everyone there. Bill, if I can get you to go back to some of the macro comments that you closed at your prepared comments with. My recollection is that some of your comments back in December, some of your public comments, you had the opinion that we were looking at a more of a V shaped recovery in oil prices and maybe activities well, but I wanted to, can you talk about how your view of the macro landscape has changed over the last couple of months and what you think, I know you just referenced $65 oil in a year, is that a reasonable point to anchor on as far as your expectations for \u201916? Bill Thomas : Charles, I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ve talked about our shape of the recovery. But, our view now is that we really believe with the consensus opinion that as we go forward due to the response of the industry that we could have flat to maybe even negative U.S. production growth on a month-over-month basis by the end of this year, and that certainly going to slowdown U.S. production growth this year. So, as that slows down there should be a price response and I\u2019m not going to predict whether it\u2019s going to be V or U or W o really what the price is, certainly the forward curve is very indicative that prices will increase in the future and we\u2019re just going to wait and see how that goes and we\u2019ll respond accordingly. Charles Meade : Got it. And that\u2019s actually good segway to the next question I would like to ask, it really gets to this inventory and what are the set of, what set of conditions would lead you to start really wanting to work that down, I mean, current forward curve as I said I think January crude read around $60 bucks, January \u201916 crude would that be, would $60 crude would be sufficient for you to start, want you to work that down or perhaps that in combination with some other factors on completion costs or sort that of thing. Can you just elaborate a bit on how you\u2019re thinking about it? Bill Thomas : Yes certainly, we\u2019re deferring these completions because we do believe that prices will be better in the future and even at $10 increase in oil price gives us a significant additional return on our investment and NPV upside. So, really our rate of return focus and our capital return focus is really what\u2019s driving the deferral. And let me kind of walk you through, there is two parts of this deferral, one is as Gary said we\u2019re starting out 2015 with about 200 uncompleted wells in our inventory and that uncompleted well inventory will grow throughout 2015. And if oil prices improve and they look something like the forward curve in the $60 range then we would begin completing many of those wells starting in the third quarter of 2015 and that would reflect additional growth in the fourth quarter heading into 2016. So, we want to head in the 2016 on an uptick in production growth. So our curve in 2015 would be U-shaped. It will be the lowest production, will be in the second quarter and then in the third quarter and then production will begin to increase in the fourth quarter as we head into 2016. Then at the end of the year, we will have about 285 wells and inventory to start to 2016 process and that will give us a bit of an advantage as we go into 2016 and we will be able to grow oil at very strong double-digit rates and be able to stay free cash flow neutral in our $65 oil price environment. So hopefully that gives you a bit of more understanding of what we are thinking. Charles Meade : Bill that's great insight into your thinking, exactly what I was looking for, thank you. Operator : And we will go now to Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets. Leo Mariani : Yes guys. I was just hoping you can speak a bit into sort of how quickly once the price response is in place where you can start working down the backlog of completions, is that just the matter of a month or two and then additionally just following up on what you have just mentioned there in terms of if we have got to $60 oil say by midsummer where you might start completing more wells in 3Q is that contemplated in the production guidance in 2015 for EOG? Tim Driggers : What we have contemplated is just as Bill was saying is we will ramp-up in the fourth quarter and you are right, it would take us about one month since we have wells drilled wait down completion to go ahead and see the impact of that production. So yes, we would start somewhere like September and start the ramp-up if we have been encouraged with oil prices improvement. Bill Thomas : And yes that is included in our guidance. Production guidance for 2015. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. And I guess I notice that you guys did have a relatively healthy increase here in the dividend this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about how you balance kind of returning cash to shareholders through the dividend with drilling wells obviously the returns on the wells are still quite strong here at $55 oil so how do you think about the increase in dividend just given where oil is right now? Bill Thomas : Yes, now we didn't increase the rate of dividend in this quarter. So, we did increase it twice last year, but too healthy now, so that's just the give back to the shareholders share within the success of the company as we end this lower price environment, the opportunity to further increase the rate is a bit more limited. And so, we will really just have to see how oil prices respond in the future and to consider additional increases in the dividend. The company is very committed to that part of the business and to the shareholders in that way. So it\u2019s a very top priority for us, but we need a bit better business environment to work on that. Leo Mariani : Alright, thanks. Operator : And we will take our next question from Pearce Hammond from Simmons & Company. Pearce Hammond : Thank you for taking my questions. My first question is what percent of total well cost is completion and where do you expect that to go with service cost decreases? Bill Thomas : Well our drilling cost is roughly 25% to 30% of the cost of the well. So that gives you the completion, of course, I guess we could put facilities in there so the facilities would be somewhere around 10%. So, the balance being completion and the other part of the question is what Pearce? Pearce Hammond : How you see those service costs decreasing, those completion costs decreasing over the course of this year? Billy Helms : Yes. When we put our budget together we were seeing 5% to 10% cost reduction. Now, we are seeing 10% to 30% cost reduction that of course depends on the sector. But just to kind of illustrate that not just mentioned in the Eagle Ford you noticed in our exhibit 18, we are showing our well cost to 6.1%, we are expecting, we are setting our target, we hope to see somewhere around 5.5% or about a 10% reduction. In the Bakken we have got 9.3%, our target would be to further lower that growth of 9.3% in \u201914 we have got 8.2% is our planned number, but we have got a target that\u2019s slightly less than that maybe 19%. So overall, we are expecting our cost to come down somewhere around to 10% to 20% from 2014. Pearce Hammond : Thank you Billy and then what is the base decline for the company? Billy Helms : Yes Pearce, we haven't given that number out. The decline rate in the region we have decline rate is slowing overtime. So there is three reasons for that. One is every year that goes by, our well by its gets more matured then we have got older wells bigger percentage of older wells all the time. So that's slowing the process. Number two, our completion technology is really beginning to starting to flatten out our decline rates on a per well basis specifically the high density fracs that we talked about in the last quarter that we are applying the Eagle Ford are not only increasing the initial rates, but they are also decreasing the decline rates so we are very encouraged about that. And then number three, as we go forward, we are targeting place that have better rocks with better probability and better ability to flow oil and those rocks such as the Sandstone place in the Delaware Basin and in Wyoming have lower decline rates also. So the mix of our decline rate in the company is slowing overtime due to a number of different reasons. Pearce Hammond : Thank you very much. Operator : We will now go to Joe Allman from J.P. Morgan. Joe Allman : Thank you operator. Hi everybody. Bill Thomas : Good morning Joe. Joe Allman : Just first question is on production. So, I heard what you said about the U-shape production for 2015, I just want to get a better understanding so the first part of the question is why is the first quarter 2015 production below fourth quarter especially in the oil side, I know you sold Canada and some factor in that end and could you just give us a better understanding of the trajectory so it sounds that you are going to be down in the first quarter, down in second,, down in third and then up in fourth and like will the fourth quarter oil be flat with fourth quarter 2014 oil especially in the U.S. and I understand what\u2019s going on in the East \u2013 on that field in the third quarter? Bill Thomas : Yes Joe, the reason the first quarter volumes are down is because we began ramping down our completion spread really quickly in the year. So we wanted to and so oil continued to drop, we wanted to drop CapEx quickly and not focus on growing oil when we have the lowest prices in the first part of the year and then again as I described, the second and third quarters should be the lowest production and then the fourth quarter we will ramp back up. We don't have a number to give you on guidance on that number, but it will ramp back up significantly heading into 2016. Joe Allman : Okay. That's helpful Bill. And then, on the cash from operations, so to get the cash from operations to cover the CapEx what benchmark prices do you assume and in that are you assuming the midpoint of your production guidance? Bill Thomas : Yes, we go CapEx to discretionary cash flow should be balanced at about $58 average price this year and the second part of your question was? Joe Allman : Just are you assuming, to generate the cash flow, first I would love to get WTI assumption, brand assumption and then natural gas assumption too and then are you assuming the midpoint of your guidance when you say you are going to cover the CapEx of cash from operation so for example, if you hit the low end of your guidance you maybe sort of you would be spending somewhat? Bill Thomas : It's an average midpoint of our production for 2015, yes Joe. Joe Allman : And how about natural gas assumptions and brand oil if you get there? Bill Thomas : Yes, on the gas we issue a five year strip, and yes we issue the five year strip on that and then on the NGL, the NGL is basically a percent of oil price in our assumptions and then gas again it\u2019s a five year strip. Joe Allman : Okay. Very good, thank you. Operator : And we will go now to Bob Brackett from Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : Some clarifications on some of the other questions. One, I am trying to do the math on you start the year with 200 uncompleted, you drill about 465 wells and then you end the year with 285 or 350 uncompleted? Bill Thomas : Yes Bob, that's a good question. That 350 was an incorrect number, so correct that back to 285, we end the year with 285. So here is the number just to be completely clear, we start with 200, we drill 550 and we complete 465 during the year and we exit the year at about 285 wells uncompleted. Bob Brackett : Great. That's helpful. Quick follow-up on acquisitions you \u2013 two definitional terms, you contrasted bolt on versus large, large acquisitions is there a monetary value associated with those two numbers or those two additives? Bill Thomas : No that is not a monetary number, we just want to distinguish that we are open certainly to any kind of acquisitions that would be very highly beneficial to the company. But most likely the type of acquisitions we do are not in the very large I\u2019m talking multi-billion dollar kind of acquisition. They are really more directed towards the tactical acquisitions and they are really at very specific acreage pieces that we think are very highly productive according to our geology. Bob Brackett : And you said core areas, so that's Bakken, Eagle Ford and Permian? Bill Thomas : Well certainly, those would be the first choices but obviously those are the most competitive, but we do from time to time consider those type of things and so many emerging place. But again, we are very discriminatory there and that we are only looking for acreage that will be additive to our inventory and that means it has to be equal to or better than Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian place. Bob Brackett : Great, thank you. Bill Thomas : Thank you. Operator : And we will go now to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer : Thank you. Good morning. Bill Thomas : Good morning Brian. Brian Singer : You talked the potential for 10% to 30% vendor cost savings and I wondered as a company more vertically integrated than others can you talk more specifically where you see this potential beyond the more normal course efficiency gains you highlighted in your presentation and your comments and whether do you think the 10% to 30% is merely cyclical or secular? Bill Thomas : Let me let, Brian, let me let Gary Thomas answer this question. Gary Thomas : The good thing is as the vendors are working so well with the EOG and we are seeing that 10% to 30% across drilling, completion, production all areas. And I guess the thing that be a little unique for EOG is we believe that we are going to be seeing maybe in the 10% to 15% reduction in some of our self-sourced areas because that EOG has 3 sand plants. We also have at least a half of dozen other vendors. So there is combination of cost of sand and distance from oil site. So, we will be able to use some of the lower cost sand with us having half the number of frac fleets running in 2015. So that will be in the fit as well. As far as more granular yes, in the tubing and casing area it may be lower in 5% to 7% range. But, we are seeing stock tanks those discounts coming down as much as 25%. Brian Singer : And to follow-up, do you think that's cyclical or secular, it sounds like from your comment on just the cost of split the distance that's more high grading, but is there a secular element you see as well? Gary Thomas : No. not appreciably. I think the secular part Brian would be in the efficiency gain particularly in the technology side of it those will stay with us for years and they keep improving. The service cost comes and goes obviously with activity and so we will be a bit more short term. But, we build in long term I think cost savings in the company that will continue to stay with us. As an example, we gave this earlier we now see better returns in our Eagle Ford with $65 oil than we had with $95 oil two or three years ago. And that is mainly due to the efficiency gains we have been able to accomplish with our completion technology and the efficiency and the cost reduction on the wells. Brian Singer : That's helpful. Along those lines you talked about the acquisition strategy, but let\u2019s say oil prices do quickly recover, the acquisition opportunities are not accretive as you are hoping for. What potential do you see from your higher rate of return legacy areas to further extend your inventory beyond the 15 plus years you are at now, where are we in that ball parking? Bill Thomas : Brian, we see upside in really all of them just to start with the Eagle Ford again we still believe we are in the sixth inning there in the Eagle Ford. So, we are still testing new zones like the upper Eagle Ford and we working on down spacing and again we have added acreage there in the last year about 11,000 acres that is very high quality acreage. So, we think there is additional room there, in the Bakken we have not upgraded our Bakken well count our reserve potential after we have started this down spacing process. So, we see upside there and then in the Permian, we are diligently working on spacing and targeting and specifically in the second bond spring sand we are working on bringing the spacing patterns closer together and identifying maybe even two targets in that particular zone in the [indiscernible] we working on spacing there and we haven't upgraded that well count in the long time and then in the Wolf Camp we have multiple play zone spacing that we are working on there. We haven't upgraded that in a while. So really each one of our core areas, we believe we will continue to provide additional high quality inventory as we go forward. Brian Singer : Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Bill Thomas at this time I would like to turn the conference back over to you for additional or closing remarks. Bill Thomas : Thank you. I would just like to leave you with this last one thought, EOG is very long term focused. We could have taken a short term approach this year and just picked up the very best wells in the company to drill and focus on those and cut our capital back to really own a short term focus. But, we do not believe that's the right way to grow the company and to manage the company. We are focused on long term shareholder value and that's our focus. So, as we said, we are going to not grow oil while oil prices are low, we are going to wait for the recovery and that will be able to give us much higher returns and it\u2019s the right business decision as we go forward. So we appreciate everybody. Great questions and thank everybody for their support. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's conference and we do thank you for your participation.",

Good day and welcome to the EOG Resources' First Quarter 2015 Earnings Results Conference Call. Just as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir. Tim Driggers : Thank you. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing first quarter 2015 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable reserves, as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website. Participating on the call this morning are, Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Gary Thomas, President and Chief Operating Officer; Billy Helms, EVP, Exploration and Production; David Trice, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, VP in Marketing Operations; and Cedric Burgher, Senior VP, Investor and Public Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening and we included guidance for the second quarter and full-year 2015 in yesterday's press release. This morning we will discuss topics in the following order. Bill Thomas, will review our 2015 plan and first quarter highlights; David Trice and Billy Helms will review operational results. I'll then discuss EOG's financials, capital structure, and hedge position, and Bill will provide concluding remarks. Here is Bill Thomas. Bill Thomas : Thanks, Tim, and good morning. Our strategy this year is to remain laser focused on returns and position EOG to resume peer-leading oil growth when oil prices recover. We laid out a plan two months ago on our year-end call and I am pleased that our first quarter results are right on track. We are quickly transforming the company to be successful in this low price environment. There are four basic objectives to our 2015 plan. Objective number one, maximize 2015 return on capital invested and position the company to resume strong growth when oil prices recover. As we discussed earlier this year, our drilling operations are focused on our top three plays : the Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin, and Bakken, where 85% of our 2015 capital is directed. We generate a direct after-tax rate of return of 35% or greater, with a flat $55 WTI oil price in each of these plays, and returns improve as we lower cost and improve well productivity. We have also stated that we have no interest in accelerating oil production at the bottom of the commodity price cycle. Instead, we are drilling but deferring completions on a significant number of wells known as DUCs until oil prices improve. A $10 increase in the price of oil, with a six month deferral adds about $300,000 of net present value to a typical well. This amounts to a significant value creation from our drilled but uncompleted well inventory. It is the right business decision to drill the wells and defer completions, instead of buying out drilling contracts or growing oil in a low price environment. By deferring completion, and accelerating oil growth in a better price environment, we maximize 2015 return on capital invested and build momentum as we head into 2016. We plan to enter 2016 with approximately 285 DUCs. If oil prices recover and stabilize around $65 WTI, EOG can resume strong double-digit growth for the balance CapEx to discretionary cash flow program. Objective number two, focus on improving well productivity and operational efficiencies to position EOG to exit this downturn stronger than we entered it. There are two primary drivers that will improve our per well and total asset returns. The first is well productivity enhancement, and the second is well cost reductions. For well productivity, we are expanding our use of high density completions and testing down spacing to maximize to NPV per section. For the next productivity game changer, we are beginning to look at ways to improve horizontal target selection. It's still early but initial results have been promising. On the cost side, the slowdown in activity is giving us more time to focus on efficiency improvements. While much has been made of service cost reductions, we expect, we will gain the most long-term benefits from efficiency gains. Our efforts of driving down both well cost and operating expenses. Currently well costs are already running at or below 2015 plan levels across all our major plays. You will hear more specifics on cost reduction and productivity gains in a few minutes, as we discuss individual play highlights. Objective number three, protect our balance sheet by meeting our cash flow and CapEx expectations for the year. As a result of existing service contract commitments, and projects set in motion in 2014, capital spent for this year is front-end loaded. We outspent discretionary cash flow in the first quarter. But for the remainder of the year we expect discretionary cash flow and CapEx to be balanced, if oil price remains near recent level. Capital discipline and the strong balance sheet are key to our long-term strategy. This allows us to manage our company through a low commodity price environment, such as today's, in addition that strength allows EOG to continue to make smart long-term rate of return driven operational decisions, such as infrastructure investments and acreage additions that will pay dividends for years to come. Objective number four, take advantage of opportunities during the down cycle to add acreage. We are using our exploration skills to define high quality acreage and are having good success capturing leasehold interest in emerging plays. Competition is down, acreage is available, and leasing costs are low compared to previous years, and we are optimistic more opportunities will materialize as the year progresses. We are also evaluating tactical acquisition candidates. Now let's take a moment to discuss our production performance and the outlook for the remainder of the year. We are not interested in growing oil at the bottom of the commodity price cycle. While oil production did come down sequentially in the first quarter, it was slightly over the high-end of our guidance. The driver of our outperformance was primarily improved well resorts. Our integrated completion technology, which combines improvements in target selection, and geo steering, with our latest techniques and high density completion decision is providing the next step change in our well performance. The best rocks respond best and big fields keep getting bigger. EOG's combination of sweet spot acreage and industry-leading technology enables us to continue to outperform expectations. As we described on our February call, our production profile will be U-shaped this year. If the current forward oil curve continues to improve, our plan is to increase well completions in the third quarter. Therefore, we expect our oil productions to return to growth in the fourth quarter, building momentum as we head into 2016. We are right on track with this plan. Now let's turn our attention to a discussion of our three high return oil plays. I will start by discussing the Eagle Ford; then David Trice, will discuss the Delaware Basin; and Billy Helms, will follow with a discussion of the Bakken and the Rockies plays. In the Eagle Ford this year, we are reducing drilling rigs from 23 at year-end 2014 to an average of 15. We plan to complete about 345 net wells which is a 35% reduction in completions compared to 2014. As we reduce activity, we have a full court press to continue to reduce well costs and improve oil productivity. And I'm happy to report that excellent progress in both areas is underway. Year-to-date, we have reduced total completed well costs by 10% from an industry-leading $6.1 million average well cost in 2014 to a current well cost of $5.5 million. The reduction is driven by combination of efficiency gains and lower service costs. For 2015, increased pad drilling and fewer drilling requirements for lease retention have contributed to the efficiency gains. This year, approximately 75% of the wells will be drilled and completed on pads, and over 80% of our acreage is currently by production. At year-end, we expect to have more than 90% of our acreage held by production. We are targeting $5.3 million well cost by the end of this year, which if accomplished, would be 7% below our 2015 plan for the Eagle Ford. In addition to cost reductions, we continue to make significant improvements in our integrated completion process, which combines target selection, geo steering, and high density completion designs. Identifying the best lot to drill the lateral, keeping the lateral in that lot longer, using the latest completion technology is making a significant difference in well productivity and decline curves. When we compare wells with high density completions versus wells with low density completions, we see a 23% increase in cumulative oil production in the first 90 days. We also see that that production rates are holding up longer. With this success, we plan to complete about 95% of our 2015 Eagle Ford wells with high density completion designs. With lower declines, production growth will be easier to achieve than in previous years, and returns on investment will continue to increase as we move forward. Finally, we're still experimenting with various techniques and spacing patterns such as using enhanced target selection methods and experimenting with W patterns within the lower Eagle Ford. We are optimistic this process will continue to increase our drilling inventory in the future. This slowdown in activity is allowing us to further evaluate this world-class asset. With better wells and lower costs, EOG's Eagle Ford asset is in great position to deliver strong growth and returns for many years to come. I will now turn it over to David Trice to cover our Permian basin activity. David Trice : Thanks, Bill. If you recall, we increased capital spend this year in the Permian, but we are still in the early innings of evaluating ultimate potential of our Delaware Basin asset. As we ramped up activity in Delaware Basin, we've made quick progress using our integrated completions process. We identified the best drilling targets within the best reservoirs, while making sure we keep our laterals in these discrete intervals. This, combined with our use of advanced EOG completion techniques, has resulted in dramatically improved wells. During the first quarter, we were most active in the Second Bone Spring Sand play, where we are testing various targets as well as different well spacing patterns. Microseismic data we have gathered throughout the play indicates good pressure containment within the individual Second Bone Spring Sand targets. For example, we drilled three wells in Lea County, New Mexico, on the Jolly Roger 16 State Lease. The wells tested three different Second Bone Spring Sand targets at 600 foot well spacing. All three targets are very productive with IP rates ranging from 1,030 to 1,315 barrels of oil per day. And the technical data we collected does not indicate any production sharing between these wells. Going forward, we will continue to push spacing limits and test new targets. Another notable Second Bone Spring Sand well we brought on in the first quarter was the Brown Bear 36 State Number 502H, which IP'd at a rate of 1,700 barrels of oil per day. We are very pleased with these results and expect our individual well performance and recoveries to continue to improve as we refine our drilling targets and implement high density conclusions. In addition to impressive well results, we are pushing down cost. Our current well cost is $6 million, which is down 22% from 2014. We expect this trend to continue and have a target cost of $5.7 million by year-end. The overpressure oil window and the Wolfcamp continues to deliver excellent results and rate of return. The Brown Bear 36 State Number 701H was drilled in Lea County, New Mexico, and came on at 3,165 barrels of oil per day. We are planning to increase our activity on this play throughout the remainder of the year. And we are confident we can achieve increased well performance and lower cost as we move toward development mode. In the Leonard Shale, we completed a 300 foot spaced; four well pattern during the first quarter. The Excelsior-12 number 3H, 4H, 5H, and 6H, were brought on line producing from 955 to 1,165 barrels of oil per day. The Leonard Shale is the most mature of our current plays in the Delaware Basin. The well economics continue to improve as we tighten spacing and lower cost. In fact, much like the Western Eagle Ford, we made better returns at $65 oil now than we could in 2012 at $95 oil. We are optimistic, similar trends will emerge in the Wolfcamp and Second Bone Spring Sand in the coming years. Even as EOG increases activity in the Delaware Basin, overall industry slowdown is helping us lower well cost, add additional acreage, and optimize long-term infrastructure needs, such as water handling and takeaway capacity. We are very excited about the potential of the Delaware Basin and its key role in EOG's future growth. Billy Helms will now discuss the Rockies plays. Billy Helms : Thanks, David. As we previously stated, most of our 2015 capital in our Rockies plays will be focused in the Bakken, with minimal activity in the DJ Basin and Powder River Basin. Each of these are well established plays with significant remaining potential. And now, all are benefiting greatly from the pull-back in activity. Plans are in place and steady progress is being made in lowering cost in each phase of our operations. In the Bakken, the slowdown in activity is allowing us to focus on three things. First, we have made tremendous progress on operational efficiencies and lowering well cost. Our typical 10,000 foot lateral is now drilled in just over 10 days. And the well cost is currently 14% less than the 2014 well cost. We anticipate this year's well cost will be as much as 20% below 2014 levels with a target of $7.4 million. Second, we are using new technical data from our integrated completion process to further adjust and tailor our high density completion designs to specific formation properties. Understanding and using this data gives us insight into to how to adjust the completion along the lateral to effectively optimize each stage. These modifications are leading to improved results. And third, we're able to maintain a more stable production base with minimal downtime associated with offset competition interference. This allows us to better evaluate the production from various spacing patterns to determine our ultimate development plan. In the first quarter, we began producing eight wells in two 500 foot space patterns in the partial area. Initial per well production rates from a five-well pattern averaged 1,235 barrels of oil per day and a three-well pattern averaged 1,345 barrels of oil per day. We are encouraged by the results from these down spacing patterns and are confident in our ability to maximize the recovery and ultimately, net present value of this asset. In the DJ Basin, we continue to refine our targeting in the Codell and experiment with modified completion designs. Recent examples of improved targeting and completions are two Jubilee Wells that each had initial production rates of over 1,000 barrels of oil per day. Further, 2015 activity in the DJ will be limited to drilling wells nearly to maintain leasehold and finishing completion operations on a few wells. In the Powder River Basin, activity will be focused on delineation and target selection of this profitable stacked resource play. The Turner formation is one of these stacked pay interval and continues to generate good results as evidenced by the recently completed Flatbow 13-13H with an IP of 860 barrels of oil per day. Our commitment to the long-term profitability of our Rockies plays is emphasized by additional infrastructure capital being invested that could reduce our future well cost by $300,000 to $500,000 per well. These investments include building more pipelines to move water to well-sites, and adding water handling infrastructure for recycling and disposal. As a result, we will not only reduce upfront capital but also reduce long-term LOE. These investments will decrease our need for trucking services and also help our communities by reducing truck traffic. I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure. Tim Driggers : Thanks, Billy. Capitalized interest for the first quarter 2015 was $12 million. Total cash exploration and development expenditures were $1.5 billion, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants, and other property, plant, and equipment, were $117 million. Drilling activity is expected to decline in the second quarter and flat now. And we have maintained our full-year capital expenditure guidance of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. At the end of March 2015, total debt outstanding was $6.9 billion, and the debt to total cap ratio was 28%. At March 31, we had $2.1 billion of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $4.8 billion or net debt to total cap ratio of 21%. In April, Moody's confirmed EOG's A3 rating with a stable outlook. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28% and the current tax expense was $31 million. For the period May 1, through June 30, 2015, EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 47,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of $91.22 per barrel. For the period July 1, through December 31, 2015, EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 10,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of $89.98 per barrel. These numbers exclude options that are exercisable by our counterparties. For the period June 1, through December 31, 2015, EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for approximately 203,500 MMBtu per day at a weighted average price of $4.31 per MMBtu. These numbers exclude options that are exercisable by our counterparties. Now, I'll turn it back over to Bill. Bill Thomas : Thanks, Tim. We continue to believe that current oil process will discourage oil exploration and development worldwide and will encourage demand growth. This will correct the current oversupply situation and the market will continue to rebalance. We believe there is more upside to the forward curve than downside. In summary, here are some important points to take away from this call. First, EOG remains disciplined. We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet. We do not plan to increase 2015 CapEx. And at recent oil price, our CapEx to discretionary cash flow will be balanced for the remainder of the year. Second, the company's priority remains clearly focused on returns. We have directed 2015 capital to our highest oil return plays, which generate 35% or better after-tax rates of return at $55 WTI price environment. Returns are improving on each of these assets as we go forward. Well costs are going down and well productivity is going up. Even as oil prices have retreated, our direct rates of return are improving, and EOG will be more than competitive in the world markets as we go forward. Third, we continue to organically grow reserve potential in our existing plays through down spacing and completion enhancements. We believe that Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin, and Bakken, will continue to grow in drilling potential. We are also optimistic that we will find new potential through our exploration efforts. As we test and confirm meaningful results, we will update you with new potential reserve estimates in the future. Fourth, we've said all along that we are preparing to return to growth in 2016 when oil prices improve. If we have $65 WTI price environment in 2016, we can presume our strong double-digit oil growth profile with a balance CapEx to discretionary cash flow program. And finally, EOG is in this business for the long-term. We've not made short-term decisions this year that would hinder our future growth. This year, we are even more committed to advancements in the technology, exploration, cost reduction, and operational execution. The company is building on the culture that has set EOG apart and resetting the bar to be successful in a lower commodity price environment. As we look to the future, we fully expect to remain the North America growth leader and the peer leader in returns on capital employed. Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate : Bill, I wonder if I could touch on your completion strategy. What would it take -- what would we need to see in order to re-up the -- I guess the pace of completions to match your drilling pace? And I guess, and a related question is the backlog that you've talked about coming out of 2015, what kind of pace would you expect to move those towards production? And then I've got a quick follow-up please. Bill Thomas : Yes, Doug, thanks for the question. Yes, the reason we've deferred the completions is to really substantially increase the rate of return. So as we go forward this year, it's really important for us to be patient and allow the prices to continue to firm up. As I've said, every -- the first $10 in oil price increase with a six months deferral is a $300,000 net PV add to typical well. So we want to make sure that we allow prices to firm up and that the prices will continue to be firm and not short-term. And then on a -- we are -- as you see, we're getting significant cost reduction as we go forward. We're gaining on that every day. And we're gaining on well productivity as we go forward. So we don't want to get in a hurry. We want to stay disciplined. We certainly don't want to jump, start completions, and the price may be fall back. So if the forward curve continues to stay firm, then our plan, as we said, is to begin completing wells in the third quarter. And we will really look at what the outlook on 2016 prices are that's what we're targeting and that's what we're really focusing on. So we'll just continue to watch the fundamentals and certainly we want to be convinced that they're strong going forward. And we'll really make the call for the third quarter activity probably July or so after we get a little bit more data. Doug Leggate : So just to be clear on the pace of -- I mean you could obviously bring those completions back very, very quickly and turbo charge to your drill. So I don't know how easy as to frame the pace but I mean would you plan to have the backlog with just -- I guess a level of this equivalent to your current drilling rate within a period of time, can you help kind of walk us through how you may think about that, just trying to see what the upside is to the growth side, when you come -- when you go back to completing those wells? Bill Thomas : Yes, we're going to -- I guess the answer to that, Doug, is we're going to be really patient and disciplined about it and kind of gradually increase the activities we go forward, making sure that the price is going to hold up. And we really do, as a company, EOG we're very, very focused on returns. So every time that price increases a little bit and every time we get the productivity wells up and get the cost down, we're making higher returns so there is no use pushing that too quickly. And so the ramp up will be, as we talked about, the production shape is going to be U-shaped this year and the second and third quarters will be the low point, but the fourth quarter, with the current plan, is to ramp up production growth and the heading into 2016 on a very strong note. Doug Leggate : Appreciate that. But my very quick follow up, hopefully I'm not taking up too much time here, but just on the comment on the tactical acquisitions, I just wonder if I could indulge me as you can get indulge me to may be elaborate a little bit on whether you're -- you see a pipeline has sufficient closer between the bid and ask, if you like. And there's been some speculation that you folks might have been interested or may be still be interested in looking at some of the resource available in California. And I just wonder if you could add that in your answer and I'll leave it there? Thank you. Bill Thomas : Yes, I'm going to ask Billy Helms, he is very engaged in that process and so he can bring us up to-date on that. Billy Helms : Yes, good morning, Doug. We're -- yes, we are looking at a lot of opportunities, as you know; there is a lot of opportunities out there. There's still a pretty good spread between the bid and ask on the acquisition front. I think we'll be very selective. We continue to be very selective in our approach, and what we're looking for, and I think we'll see some opportunities as we go forward, but there will be smaller, more tactical acquisitions, as well as just continuing to be able to accrete leasehold in some of our key plays and emerging place. And so I think that's going to be our approach. I don't think you'll see us doing any large M&A kind of things in the future. They'll be more targeted to the smaller things that we've traditionally done as a company. And so continue to be very selective and review those on a one case or case-by-case basis. Operator : And we'll move to our next question that will come from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey : Sorry to press on the drilled uncompleted but I guess a follow-up is trying to get a sense of the pace at which the 285 would come back relative to how much drilling you would do simultaneously. I think what you're saying is that a $65 plus price you would be ramping up I guess the DUCs or the drilling both simultaneously? Could you just go into that again? Thanks. Bill Thomas : Yes, Paul, that's a good question. And as we head into the last half of this year and think about 2016, we'll be on a pretty good uptick. So what we want to do is get the equipment and the people and place and get the process started certainly very strongly in the second half of the year. And then, when we hit 2016, if oil prices continue to hold up, we will continue to increase our activity accordingly. Of course the goal is and the plan is to continue to remain CapEx to discretionary cash flow balance. And so that will really govern our activity. The stronger the price of oil is they're more obviously capital we'll have to work with and the more we'll continue to increase our activity. As we look at the second part of this year, part of the process will be evaluating is how many drilling rigs to continue to have joint wells versus releasing rigs. And that certainly will be a function of what the oil price is. And so we won't get too far out in front on the drilling side. The 285 DUC that we start the year with most likely over the first half of the year will reduce significantly as we go forward and we'll exit the year, next year, with considerably less DUCs than we\u2019re exiting this year with. Paul Sankey : Yes, I think I understand. So I think -- to reinterpret the close that you're to 65 the more DUCs will be used to generate the double-digit return but excuse me seasonally double-digit growth. But what you're essentially saying if we're 65 or above you will be delivering double-digit growth next year? Bill Thomas : Yes, I think that's correct, yes, good. Paul Sankey : Thank you. And then the follow-up is there is some criticism always about the relationship between the IRRs of individual wells and how they flow through to corporate returns. Could you just add anything that you have to add on how the current environment and the outlook will flow through, if you like, to your overall corporate return on capital employed? Thank you. Bill Thomas : Yes, the rates of return that we talk about -- the direct rates of return and we used direct after-tax numbers when we quote our plays, those are on capital for the well cost and the production facilities of that well and that's the only cost in there. Of course the full corporate returns on ROCE are all capital and all capital spent from the history of the company. And so you\u2019ve got legacy gas properties in there and lots of other things in there over time and that's the real difference in the thing. As you -- everybody has noted over the last several years, EOG's ROCE numbers have continued to improve rather strongly, and over the last year, our ROCE numbers were higher certainly than the E&P peer group and they were even higher than the average of the integrators and the majors. So we have one of the strongest track records and one of the strongest ROCEs in the business and that just reflects EOG's continued focus on returns. Rates of return on our capital drives every decision in EOG and it is the fundamental metric that we use to manage the company. So as we talk about this year we're deferring wells that's really just to drive up the returns on our capital and all these things we're doing to decrease well cost and increase productivity are very, very focused on driving up the returns to the company as we go forward. So really that's the main difference. Paul Sankey : Appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : And next we'll go to Leo Mariani with RBC. Leo Mariani : Hey guys, I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color around your second quarter U.S. oil production guidance. I look at the -- I guess the midpoint in the second quarter is down roughly 10% sequentially versus the first quarter. Could you guys kind of provide some color around that whether or not number of completions is extremely limited here in the second quarter? When you guys talked about deferring and is that deferring almost all of them or just majority, could you just kind of give us some color around that? Bill Thomas : Yes, the reason that we're -- our guidance from the second quarter is down is because we've had a significant reduction in the amount of wells we complete that's really the driver. We were down 39% in completions in the first quarter. And then, in the second quarter, we were down additional 36%. And that is really just a process of deferring the wells and not completing the wells and just really taking off the spin right as we move into the second quarter. So that's really just driving it. And of course those will, we still have maintained our full-year guidance and we'll be making that backup that production backup in the second half of the year and it will be at much higher returns because we are waiting. Leo Mariani : All right. I guess obviously you guys talked about sticking to your capital budget here in all costs. But at the same time you\u2019re also talking about starting to accelerate some completions at $65 oil which could happen as soon as this 3Q. Just to clarify is that accelerated activity in 3Q and 4Q, if we get to the right oil price, is that actually in the CapEx budget for 2015 already? Bill Thomas : Yes, Leo, let me let Gary Thomas address that. Gary Thomas : Yes, Leo. We do have those incorporated in our capital with our ramp up there, as Bill said, may be starting in July just watching oil prices but then will ramp up through the year. As a matter of fact yes we're doing less completions, we're kind of keep our frac rates in place, we've dropped them down from 7 days to 5 days, just everything to conserve capital here in the first half. Leo Mariani : All right. That's helpful. And I guess just talking about some down spacing result that you all had. I guess in particular looks like in the Bakken and the Leonard; it looks like some of the IP rates you reported in some of those areas a little bit lower than some of the previous wells. Am I interpreting that you may be seeing some initial interference on those or is that incorrect? Billy Helms : Yes, Leo, this is, Billy Helms. For the Bakken, as we continue to experiment with our completion designs we're seeing different areas of the field have different rock properties and we're tailoring those completion designs to match those rock properties. So we have, as you can imagine the quality of the rock varies across the field, so you got some areas that generate a little bit higher production rates than other areas. So it's just a function of the properties of that particular area other reservoir and we're very confident that our down spacing patterns and our approaches that we're testing are going to lead to our best recovery in net present value for those assets. Operator : And next we'll go to Subash Chandra with Guggenheim. Subash Chandra : So a question on the Eagle Ford. I guess the W pattern staggered pattern I guess being described there in some of the other things you're trying. Is it too early to hazard a guess as to the inventory gains you might have come out of this process and similarly and say the Bakken where you're doing similar work? Bill Thomas : Yes, it's too early on that to give some guidance on the inventory possibilities but certainly we\u2019re optimistic. There is going to be upside but a little of what we're doing there is we\u2019re using some enhanced identification tools to really identify the very, very best targets in the lower Eagle Ford. The rock quality varies as you go vertically up and down the section and we believe we have the ability to identify better rock in certain parts of the Eagle Ford and then make target selections based on that. So it's not just a geo metric pattern, it really is got a lot of technical work behind it and a lot of high grading as we pick each one of those targets. And so we're really just starting that process and we're optimistic about it but it's really too early to give guidance on the amount of upside it might be. Subash Chandra : It is fair to say though I think in your commentary you said that because my initial impression was that individual wells will be better but I think you talked about increasing inventory there. So is it fair to say that as you target these laterals you might actually be accessing or getting a lot more locations out of more of the rock within say a section? Bill Thomas : Yes, that's definitely true. We're hopeful that it will continue to build our inventory up. We have to prove that but certainly that is strong possibility. Operator : And next we'll go to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : Bill, if I could ask a question again on your 2015 plans, may be from a little different angle. The way it seems to me, what you've articulated this morning it\u2019s pretty much the same as what you talked about two months ago with ramping activity towards the end of the year into 2016. But I'm curious, can you may be speak about at the margin, has there been a shift in your thinking, especially, we're looking at crude over $60, close to $61 here today. And is there may be some subtlety in a shift from which we're thinking a couple of months ago when you talked about Q4 results that you want to direct us to? Bill Thomas : No Charles. That\u2019s a good question. We really don\u2019t have a lot of different outlook on the macro or our 2015 plan than we had back in our February call. We made the call to defer drilling, because we thought this would be or could be a short-term cycle, and we're hopeful and certainly we're encouraged by the current firming of the products. So we\u2019re hopeful that\u2019s what will turn out. But we still, as I said earlier, we're more optimistic in the forward curve than what it is right now. So we believe being patient and waiting on that products to continue to come up, while also continuing to take advantages of the cost reductions in the wells and the well productivity improvement. Those will all make a very significant difference in the returns we get on the wells when we begin to complete them. So you're correct. The plan is in the process of thinking is really, basically the same as it was in February? Charles Meade : Right. Thank you for that clarification. Then, if I could ask about the -- you guys talked a few times in your press release about these integrated completion designs and tailoring the completion to the individual wellbore. Can you talk a bit about what that means? Whether it means varying the stage spacing along the wellbore, whether it's -- you\u2019re choosing your different pump rates or sand loadings for one stage versus the next, and perhaps also offer an idea of how big an opportunity is this? David Trice : Yes, Charles, this is David. On these integrated completion, it's not a whole lot of different than what we've always been. We've always really focused on the very best rock and the very best interval within the overall section. And we try to keep our lateral in that and then when it comes with completions, we integrate that in as well. And we do very; we basically design each stage for the well and for that specific portion of the lateral. So it\u2019s really an overall process and we've seen dramatic results over the years and even over the last several quarters in the well results. We really think of the -- it\u2019s really kind of part of the EOG culture and gives us a big competitive advantage going forward. Operator : And next we'll go to Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities. Irene Haas : Hello, my question has to do with Delaware Basin. You are in full development mode in the Second Bone Spring, just may be a little bit more color on the Wolfcamp. Your successful wells are they coming from the upper or middle interval; and ultimately, how many benches within the Wolfcamp could be productive in this part of Delaware Basin so in the central North? David Trice : Yes, Irene, this is David. As far as the Wolfcamp goes, we mainly have been targeting the upper Wolfcamp. We think that there is a very large potential throughout the Wolfcamp. But our very focus has mainly been on the upper. And with regard to the Second Bone Spring Sand, we're moving towards development mode there. We obviously have a lot of work to do. We're testing a lot of targets. We're testing spacing there, and we're continuing to refine our completions but we see quite a bit upside left, really in all those plays. Operator : And moving on we\u2019ll go to David Tameron with Wells Fargo. David Tameron : I'll leave the acceleration question alone. I don't want to hit on that anymore. But just to clarify, you guys in the presentation you put in well cost which are running ahead of plan and then you put some target well cost, are those achievable, are those targets achievable? Is that a 2015 goal or is that a 2016 kind of outlook or how should we think about those target well cost? Gary Thomas : This is Gary Thomas. On last February, we just mentioned that we were expecting to see our well cost down in the 10% to 20% range. And we're really pleased with the progress that we've made there and various things, but looks to me that our cost is going to be in the 20% to 20% plus. And most all these areas, we\u2019ve got target wells, our record wells that have exceeded our targets. So yes, we're making good strides there. And we're also pleased that about half of that gain has been in vendor-cost reduction, but the other half has been in our efficiency gains. I'm really pleased with the efficiency gains, because you can see that on the number of days per well. And that\u2019s why we had the one Exhibit comparing yes the Barnett that we had worked in for several years versus the Eagle Ford. And there is still quite a lot of room, which is the EOG myntra; pleased, not satisfied. We're going to continue to make gains there. Operator : Moving on we\u2019ll go to Pearce Hammond with Simmons and Company. Pearce Hammond : Bill, service providers have highlighted refracts as a significant opportunity. Do you see such an opportunity for EOG with refracts? Bill Thomas : Pearce, we get that question quite a bit and we've looked at it and talked about it internally and we've not tried any refracts. Our outlook on that is that it really -- technically, we believe that just drilling a new well and kind of starting fresh and making sure your lateral is in the very best target and making sure that you can redistribute the frac very evenly along the wellbore with the new well is probably the preferred way to go. We just think that the upside on the completion will be much greater than if you try to refract the well. Then the other thing, obviously that contributes to that is the well cost on the drilling side is we can see are just getting lower and lower and becoming a smaller percentage of the total well cost. So drilling a new well from the drilling side standpoint is just a pretty low-cost item today. And there is a lot more upside in just drilling the well -- redrilling the well and doing it right. Pearce Hammond : Great. Thanks for that color. And then my follow-up is how quickly do you think the industry and this includes obviously the service companies have to lay off a lot of people. How quickly do you think the industry can respond to higher prices? Is there going to be a substantial lag to adding activity or do you think there is enough capacity out there, service capacity that it can come back and fairly rapid order? Bill Thomas : No, it Pearce, it depends on how much longer this goes. If we were ramping up here in the next month or two, I think you can ramp up pretty rapidly. And that's why many of those operators are trying to keep as many services in place even if reduced work levels just to maintain that support that service companies. So as we've said before, yes, we\u2019ll be able to ramp there pretty rapidly on our production with just our DUCs that we have in inventory. But then it will take possibly a little longer just from the drilling site. Operator : And next we'll go to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer : I wanted to just see if you could provide some clarity on how your decline rates are trending versus your expectations on fee front? It seems you\u2019re naturally seeing sharper first year decline rates that complement your higher initial production rates from enhanced completion. What trends are you seeing overall versus your type curves in the Eagle Ford, Bakken, and Permian, when it comes to declines and the many efforts you\u2019re making on longer-term decline rate mitigation in this environment? Billy Helms : Yes, Brian, this is Billy Helms. What we're actually seeing on our new completion approach is by targeting the wells in the better pay zones and then doing a better job of placing the completions along the lateral is we're seeing actually that declines are flattening over time. So little bit less decline over time and I think that's transferring yourself all through the company level I think as the base of production gets more material and larger and relative to the new wells we're bringing on that our -- our production decline is flattening over time as well. So I think we're seeing a lot of advantages to this new completion technique that we're still yet to fully realize and will material with time. Brian Singer : Got it. Thank you. And then shifting back to the Delaware Basin and the Wolfcamp area you highlighted the Brown Bear Wolfcamp Well. Can you put into context what a 24 hour rate of 2,165 barrels a day means relative to your 900 MBOE typical Wolfcamp EUR it seems like the oil mix there was much higher versus your typical well. And whether this is an area that you already assumed was commercial or whether it represents a step out in Lea County, just kind of want to see whether this is a normal well, an above average well or something that\u2019s more substantive from a resource and productivity perspective? David Trice : Yes, Brian, this is David. I would say, certainly this is a very good well and we\u2019re not necessarily surprised by the Lea County is a good area. We\u2019ve drilled some good Wolfcamp wells there in the past. I think as far as how it compares with the model, I think it would be fairly close to the model and we continue to see progress on these wells and I think over time we're hopeful that we'll even see better wells. Operator : And our final question will come from Marshall Carver with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Marshall Carver : Yes, regarding the W shape patterns in the Eagle Ford are you testing that in several areas then how much of your acreage do you think might work for that. And how far are part of the wellbores in those patterns? How much tighter is it than what you were doing before? Bill Thomas : Marshall, the W pattern we will do multiple pilots patterns on that and it really will apply to I think the bulk of our Eagle Ford acreage. And what we're doing is we\u2019re bringing the wells in. We've been drilling wells anywhere from 3 to 500 feet apart in our typical patterns, but we're bringing those closer. And we'll be doing that at various spacing closer than 3 to 500 feet and it really will vary a bit on the spacing depending on the area. But the general concept of taking out multiple targets within the lower Eagle Ford using these advanced techniques to identify the best rock will be apical across the bulk of our acreage. Marshall Carver : Okay, thank you. And one follow-up if I could the current 2016 strip is at $65 but you mentioned seeing more upside than downside on the strip. How would hedges potentially factor into your plans to accelerate if the strip moves up could we see a flat -- how are you thinking about that hedges and how you could be your plans for acceleration? Bill Thomas : Yes, Marshall, we're certainly evaluating that all along and we're really again a bit more optimistic about forward curves even then it is today. But we want to put some hedges in going into next year. And we'll just be looking at that and trying to find the opportunistic entry point as we kind of go forward. So really kind of watch the fundamentals of supply and demand and really pick the point that we think is the right point to make an entry there. Operator : And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll turn it back to Mr. Bill Thomas for any additional or closing comments. Bill Thomas : We\u2019re very excited about what\u2019s happening in EOG this year. We said at the beginning of the year that when this downturn started that we wanted to emerge in better shape than we entered it. And what you\u2019re seeing today and what we're reporting today is exactly that happening. And in my 36 years with the company, I\u2019ve never seen a company respond better. The company is driving down the cost and improving the productivity of the wells rapidly and whether oil prices remain where they are today or continue to improve, EOG is resetting the bar to be successful for many years to come, and we thank -- so thank you for listening today and thank you for all your support. Operator : Thank you. And once again that will conclude today's conference. We'd like to thank everyone for their participation.",

As a reminder this call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir. Tim Driggers : Thank you. Good morning and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing second quarter 2015 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release in EOGs SEC filings and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our Web site www.eogresources.com. The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with, or contemplated by the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release. Participating on the call this morning are all, Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Gary Thomas, President and Chief Operating Officer; Billy Helms, EVP, Exploration & Production: David Trice, EVP, Exploration & Production; Lance Terveen, VP, Marketing & Operations; and Cedric Burgher, Senior VP, Investor and Public Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our Web site yesterday evening and we included guidance for the third quarter and full year 2015 in yesterday's press release. This morning we will discuss topics in the following order. Bill Thomas will update our 2015 plan. David Trice and Billy Helms will review operational results. I will then discuss EOGs financials, capital structure and hedge position and Bill will provide concluding remarks. Here is Bill Thomas. Bill Thomas : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. There are couple of items; I will cover with you on the call today. First, I will discuss the outstanding progress we have made transitioning the company to be successful in a lower oil price environment. And I will explain why EOG is uniquely positioned to accomplish this. Second, I will describe the framework we are using to determine our activity level for the remainder of the year. Our goal this year is to remain laser focused on improving returns. At the beginning of the year, we noted that our after-tax rate of return at $65 oil were better than at $95 oil three years ago. We are pleased to report that we have further improved these well economics even as oil prices have declined. Through improved well productivity and lower cost, our key oil plays now are in a 30% after-tax rate of return with a flat $50 oil price. We have multiple decades of drilling inventory in these high returns world-class assets. EOG is rapidly adjusting to lower oil prices. We believe that our ability to quickly adapt to this new environment illustrates our competitive advantages. There are five drivers which make EOG uniquely positioned to improve returns year-after-year. The first is large, high-quality assets, we have captured the sweet spot in the best horizontal crude oil assets in the U.S., The Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware Basin. The quality of our assets is why EOG drills the most productive oil wells in the U.S. The scale of our positions drives tremendous efficiencies and the diversity of our assets allows us to transfer technology gains and cost savings from basin to basin. The second driver is innovations and technology. New ideas and technically drive continuous productivity improvements. For example, we developed in-house, integrated completion technology that consistently drives field recoveries higher and maximizes NPV. During the first five years of drilling the Eagle Ford, we increased its reserve potential 250%. This quarter we increased our Bakken net potential reserves to 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent, a 150% increase. EOG has over 10 years of horizontal shale experience to build on and we expect to continue advancing our knowledge through innovation and technology. The third is low cost. We believe EOGs well and operating costs were are already the lowest in the industry and 2015 is proving to be our best year ever for realizing additional cost reductions. EOG scale and high-quality assets and proprietary technology will continue to drive future efficiency gains and cost reductions. The fourth driver is organic growth. This is the lowest cost, highest return approach to adding drilling potential. Being first movers in exploration allows us to capture large amounts of high-quality rock at much lower cost than through acquisition and exploit strategy. Organic exploration is an important competitive advantage for EOG and we see significant opportunities ahead of us. Last but not least, is EOGs organization and culture. This is the catalyst for the first four drivers and underpins our competitive advantage. A decentralized structure encourages asset level, bottom-up decision-making, which leads to better execution, our core culture is return driven. Employee performance is incentivized by greater return which is a key driver to our peer leading return on capital employed. Return-based decision-making and incentives drive EOGs success. The second item I will cover today is our plan for the remainder of 2015. We are maintaining total company oil production guidance while reducing 2015 CapEx guidance by approximately $200 million. In addition, our projected year-end uncompleted well inventory has increased from 285 to 320. The bottom line is productivity improvements and reduced costs are allowing us to produce more oil with less capital. Many of you are asking when will EOG grow oil again? We have said all along that we do not want to grow production until we see the oil market is firmly rebalancing. We will be watching the supply/demand fundamentals in the second half of this year closely as we determine our plan for 2016. Currently, we intend to spend within cash flow. The capital efficiency gains we have made this year along with our large high-quality inventory of uncompleted wells positions us for an excellent 2016. My number one message is this, we are resetting the economics of our business, EOG is quickly adapting to be successful in a low oil price environment. We expect EOG to remain the lowest cost U.S. shale producer and competitive in the world oil market. I will now turn it over to David Trice to discuss the update on our Bakken resource estimates as well as other activities in the Rocky. David Trice : Thanks Bill. We're pleased with the performance from our spacing tests using our integrated the completion process in the Bakken. We now estimate that our Bakken and Three Forks total net resource potential is just over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. That's almost 2.5x our original estimate of 420 million barrels of oil equivalent. Remaining drilling inventory increased from 580 to over 1500 net drilling locations. This represents 760 million barrels of oil equivalent of remaining net potential reserves and decades of drilling in this premier North Dakota asset. In addition to the updated resource estimate, we split the Bakken into two categories that we have tiled core acreage and non-core acreage. The core producers return that are competitive with both the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin and includes our acreage in the Bakken core and Antelope extension. Non-core represents acreage in the Bakken Lite, State Line and Elm Coulee areas. Although our main focus will be in the core area we believe that with modern high density completions and current well cost, the non-core acreage will be very economic even with low oil prices. We defined 120,000 net acres and 590 net drilling locations in the core, which represents remaining net resource potential of 360 million barrels of oil equivalent. This inventory alone offers over 10 years of drilling. Non-core acreage represents remaining net resource potential of 400 million barrels equivalent. In this acreage we defined 110,000 net acres and 950 net drilling locations which provide decades of inventory. Our wells in the Bakken continue to exceed expectations. A great example of the progress we're making is the Riverview 102-32H well. This is the first Bakken well in the Antelope extension we have drilled using a high density completion. The well came online with a maximum rate of 3395 barrels of oil per day and 6 million feet of rich natural gas. With an average rate of 2760 barrels of oil per day for July, this short 4300 foot lateral will be the highest rate oil well ever recorded for the Bakken or Three Forks. We are excited to continue applying high density completions throughout the entire play as we move forward. In addition to improved returns to advance completions, we have made tremendous progress on Bakken completed well cost, which are now $7.1 million for an 8400 foot treated lateral this is almost 20% decrease in well costs from 2014. Most of the well cost savings are due to efficiency gains rather than vendor cost reductions. Therefore, should be sustainable over time. Drilling times are now averaging 8.2 days Spud-to-TD for an 8400 foot lateral with our best being a record 5.6 days. We are also realizing significant completion efficiencies. Currently we are averaging more than 10 completion stages per day up from 4 to 5 stages per day in 2014. In addition plug drill out times have been cut in half since 2014. Finally, cost savings are not just limited to CapEx. We added infrastructure this year in the Bakken core and as a result we have seen dramatic LOE reductions. Second quarter LOE is down more than 25% from the first quarter. The increase to our Bakken reserve potential in drilling inventory illustrates the value of the EOGs exploration and technology leadership. We enter play as a first mover and capture the best assets. Then we drill them through the drill bit and improve recoveries over time with drilling and completion technology developed in-house. This is how EOG continues to grow organically. Here is Billy Helms to update you on the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford. Billy Helms : Thanks, David. The plays in the Delaware Basin are also proving to be very good examples of how EOG is repositioning itself to generate strong returns in this period of low commodity prices. We have made improvements to productivity while significantly lowering completed well costs. In the case of improved productivity we're finding that wellbore targeting along with our integrated completion approach continues to provide upside on well performance. In the second quarter, we maintained our activity in the 2nd Bone Spring sand testing various spacing patterns and targets. Two recent wells, the Dragon 36 State Number 501H and 502H were completed in a 1000 foot space pattern with initial production rates of 1075 and 1755 barrels of oil per day. Another recent completion in Lea County, New Mexico, the Frazier 34 State Com Number 501H tested 1705 barrels of oil per day with 145 barrels per day of NGL and 1.1 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. The completed well cost for the 2nd Bone Spring sand are currently averaging $6 million per well representing a 22% reduction from last year's average. A major portion of the cost savings can be attributed to sustainable efficiency improvements in both drilling and completion operations rather than solely vendor cost reductions. Improved well performance coupled with lower well cost make this play very attractive in this low commodity price environment. We will continue evaluating well performance to determine the proper spacing and ultimate recovery. During the last quarter, we also completed several strong Wolfcamp wells in the overpressured oil window of the play. Two recent completions in Lea County New Mexico, the Dragon 36 State Number 701H and the Hearns 27 State Com Number 703H had initial production rates per well of 2650 barrels of oil per day along with 285 barrels per day of NGLs and 1.9 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. As we evaluate various targets and spacing patterns this play promises to be a high return growth asset for EOG. Similar advancements have been achieved in the Leonard play. A typical well now cost $5.5 million and we're testing spacing patterns of 300 feet and 500 feet between wells. One recent completion in Lea County New Mexico, the Gem 36 State Com 1H had an initial production rate of 2200 barrels of oil per day, 460 barrels per day of NGLs and 2.6 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. Our downspacing efforts demonstrate that we can drill wells closer together without sacrificing production. These new completion designs are allowing us to improve the overall economics and ultimate recovery. Due to these strong results, we anticipate the Delaware Basin will play a significant role in EOGs long-term growth. As typical with our other plays, EOG will evaluate options and invest in the infrastructure needed to serve future production growth while keeping our long-term operating cost to a minimum. We are very excited about the opportunities and growth potential for EOGs Delaware Basin properties. Now moving to the Eagle Ford which continues to be our work horse asset, due to the sheer scale of our operations there it functions as a laboratory for technical progress, on target selection, geosteering and high density completion designs. To support our wellbore targeting efforts this year, we drilled four pilot wells together additional log data and provide a more complete picture of our acreage. This information greatly enhances our understanding of any specific targets variability across the play. We are currently conducting tests using a staggered W pattern in the lower Eagle Ford. And the new data we have gathered on the targets is encouraging as it supports our expectations for success. While it is too early to share results we are excited about the benefits our targeting efforts can have on our Eagle Ford drilling program and ultimate field recovery. We are also pleased with the progress of cost reduction efforts in the Eagle Ford. Our average completed well cost is currently $5.5 million and headed toward our 2015 goal of $5.3 million. Similar to our other plays, most of these cost reductions are being achieved through efficiency gains and should be sustainable. Also, the productivity of the wells continues to show steady improvement through our emphasis on targeting and high density completions. Some of the recent wells are highlighted in our press release. The combination of cost reductions and better well performance through the application of technology is ensuring that this world-class asset will continue to deliver stronger growth for years to come. I will now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure. Tim Driggers : Thanks Billy. Capitalized interest for the second quarter 2015 was $11 million. Total cash exploration and development expenditures were $1.2 billion excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $85 million. At the end of June 2015, total debt outstanding was $6.4 billion in the debt to total capitalization ratio was 27%. At June 30, we have $1.4 billion of cash on hand giving us non-GAAP net debt of $5 billion for net debt to total cap ratio of 22%. In April, Moody's confirmed EOGs A3 rating with a stable outlook. In July, we successfully entered into a new $2 billion credit agreement to replace the existing one which would have matured in October 2016. Terms of the new agreement are similar to the prior credit agreement. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 146% and current tax expense was $41 million. For the period August 1 through December 31, 2015, EOG has crude oil financial price swap's contracts in place for 10,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of $89.98 per barrel. For the second -- I'm sorry, for the period September 1 through December 31, 2015, EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 175,000 MMBtu per day at a weighted average price of $4.51 per MMBtu. These numbers exclude options that are exercisable by our counterparties. Now, I will turn it back over to Bill. Bill Thomas : Thanks, Tim. Concerning our macro view, we believe current oil prices are not sustainable and the market will rebalance. Low oil prices are slowing supply growth and encouraging demand worldwide. We believe that U.S. oil production will have significant month-over-month declines in the second half of this year. So our assessment is, there is more upside to the forward curve than downside. In summary, before we open up the call for Q&A, I want to talk about the core fundamentals that defined EOGs strategy for creating long-term shareholder value. The first core fundamental is that EOG is return driven. We allocate capital in order to earn the highest returns. As we have done for many years, our goal is to be the peer leader in capital returns. Our second core fundamental is organic growth. Growing through the drill bit is the most return friendly, and therefore, shareholder friendly means of growth. Our goal is to be the leader in organic U.S. oil growth. The third core fundamental is a strong balance sheet. Our goal is to maintain a disciplined spending program that keeps our net debt low and liquidity strong. Finally, the fourth core fundamental is commitment to the dividend. Our track record indicates our continued commitment to the dividend. Staying focused on these four core fundamentals, return driven, organic growth, strong balance sheet and commitment to the dividend is how EOG consistently delivers long-term shareholder value. Thanks for listening. Now, we will go to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Hi. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for all the detail on the slide deck. Bill, I wanted to start with a micro question if I may because you guys have obviously done a phenomenal job of getting your costs down, your efficiency improvements and I think a couple of slides really speak to the depth of the portfolio. But, it seems that you are making a micro decision based on oil price and no one else seems to be taken the same view. In other words, you're forgoing production growth and a lot of your peers with lesser economics are continuing to pursue goals. I'm just kind of wondering, if you can help us reconcile your micro thoughts with the stock specific opportunities you have in the portfolio. And I guess with a view to 2016. I have got a follow-up. Bill Thomas : Yes. Doug, our macro view is \u2013 we think a very solid view. We do a lot of work and a lot of study on the process and we particularly model what everybody is saying in the U.S. and what they're going to be doing in the second half of this year through their guidance. And we really believe that in the second part of this year we are going to see some strong month-over-month decline rates. And it may take \u2013 it will take probably at least two or three more months for the monthly numbers to confirm this. There is a two-month lag in the data and the data is not, as we know, not precise and it gets updated over time. So what we really need to see to confirm this is the July and August monthly data and that will come in, in September and October. So hopefully by that time the declines will be a bit more evident to everybody and if that happens we could see a bit more from this in the price. So our model shows what everybody is guiding that the U.S. will grow about 500,000 to 600,000 barrels a day this year versus the $1.2 million barrel a day last year. So there's a significant drop-off in the year-over-year growth rate. And then if the prices continue to stay low through the end of the year, we expect 2016 to have continued month-over-month decline rates in the U.S. And that will be joined by decline rates in other non-OPEC supply in 2016. And the combination of those things with the continued reasonable demand growth gives a decent opportunity for prices to be a bit better than they are right now in 2016. So certainly that was a factor in our decision to defer spending capital, trying to accelerate oil in the current market. The other thing is, certainly is that we just can't see a good business reason to outspend growing oil in an oversupplied oil market. This does not make sense to us. So we believe we made the right decision. Doug Leggate : Bill, I admire the discipline. I don't want to belabor this point, but I guess what I'm thinking is, if I look at Slide 5, you clearly have better returns today. For example, in the Leonard than you did when oil was substantially higher, which obviously fits your incentives structure to attract returns. I guess what I'm really kind of thinking is that, let's assuming that you are wrong in oil prices don't recovery and consensus seems to be lower for longer. Would you go back to growth in 2016? Bill Thomas : Let me give you a good overview. That's a good question. The company is set up for exceptionally strong performance in 2016. The capital required from growth in 2016 is considerably lower then we have had in the previous years. Number one, as you noted, we have achieved very strong efficiency gains on the capital by lowering the cost, banking better wells to technology. And we're going to be able to continue that process in the second half of the year and really reap the benefits of that in 2016. And the second thing is that as we talked about, we have a very large now 320 -- estimate 320 uncompleted well inventory that will be very high quality. I think it will be the highest quality inventory of any operator in the U.S. and that inventory is ready to complete, to begin completion early in the year next year. We have infrastructure in place for all of that uncompleted inventory. So that won't slow us down. And then we're making significant improvements in lowering decline rates in a number of different ways. The first one is, we continue to drill our laterals in better rock. We're drilling -- we are taking a lot of time and effort, picking out the best quality rock in each one of these plays and keeping the lateral in that longer. And then and to execute that well is very important. And when we do that, we now are doing a much better job with these high density fracs and better distributing the frac along the lateral, connecting up more of that good rock. And it certainly lowering our decline rates over time and that makes it easier to grow production. And the last thing, which is very important, we have tremendous capital flexibility in 2016. We don't have many service or rig contracts that will be in place as we begin 2016. We have very few lease retention requirements and we have very few international commitments. So we are fully flexible to concentrate our capital, particularly in the first half of the year, on this very high-quality uncompleted well inventory. We are not going to give any specific guidance on our CapEx until February of next year. We want to work the details and so we're just going to -- we will make our CapEx plans based on what the 2016 forward curve looks like in February. And we are going to remain patient and really run our business right and continue the focus on improving the returns as we go forward. Doug Leggate : I appreciate it. That's a lengthy answer. I will get back in queue for my follow-up. [indiscernible] time. Thanks again. Operator : We will next go to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio : Good morning. Let me follow up on your 2016 comments and I appreciate your asset position and you're not in the budget mode today. You are philosophically, I mean if necessary to stay within cash flow into 2016, are you willing to go into annual production declines or is that where you would consider drawing ducts or moving into an outspend? Bill Thomas : Evan, we definitely want \u2013 that's a primary goal is to just have a balanced spending program or CapEx is balanced with our discretionary cash flow. Next year, our capital required just to maintain the flat production is very low. So we don't see a scenario that we can't keep production flat. So I'm going to ask Gary Thomas to kind of walk through how 2016 might unfold. Gary Thomas : The question there, Evan as far as, yes, would we just grow production? We're not inclined to grow production just in a continued low-price environment. But, like Bill saying, we are well well-positioned with all of our high-quality ducts, wells not completed. And we are going to end the year with 15 to 18 drilling rigs and we will only have 13 under loan contract next year. So in order to go ahead and just lease maintain, possibly grow production, depending on what the prices are, we will start with quite a number of completion units. And that allows us to bring production on rapidly and also we will be able to do it at low cost with all of the reduced costs we have had from increased efficiencies here through 2015. Evan Calio : Okay. I was just curious, if you would let it go to decline. It sounded more of a no than a yes. But, let me \u2013 Gary Thomas : We have maintained our productions for domestic just flat here. And that's kind of what we got here through 2015. So that's probably likely for 2016. Evan Calio : Great. My second one, if I could on a high density completions. You guys are clearly the leader here. It's 95% of Eagle Ford wells this year. You began the Bakken with a very strong Antelope extension well implemented the 2nd Bone Springs this quarter or last quarter Wolfcamp in the 3Q and Leonard since the beginning of the year. I mean can you walk me through how long it takes you to substantially implement those designs across your Delaware and Bakken positions? I'm just wondering how we should think about, how long it takes to get to a similar percentage of high-density completions as you have in the Eagle Ford and the rest of your portfolio. Gary Thomas : Evan, you have seen this work so well throughout all of our plays. We are under implementation currently. So it's in place and then we are seeing how we can make further improvements in this which is just EOGs way to do our business. So it's in place. Then the Eagle Ford and we are running it in the Permian Basin and also in the Rocky Mountains and most all of our plays. We're thrilled with the results. And we are being able, at first our cost was a little bit higher and you will notice that looking at the Eagle Ford, slightly higher, but we are finding ways to bring those costs down now. Evan Calio : Great. I will leave it there. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : Yes. Good morning to everyone there. If I could take another stab at the completion questions specifically the high density and the anti-density completion in the Bakken. I think during David's prepared comments you mentioned that what I thought I heard was that was the first completion in the site in the Antelope extension area. And I'm wondering if you could give us a little history of how long you have been doing this and in what areas you have been doing it and really that's a remarkable result with the Riverview well. And I'm wondering how applicable is that new completion technique across your whole footprint up there? David Trice : Yes, Charles. This is David. That's correct. That was the first, what we have considered high density completion in Antelope. And obviously, the results speak for themselves. It is an excellent well and we have been, like Gary had mentioned, we are applying those techniques really all across the company and certainly cross the Bakken. No two wells are exactly the same. We always customize the completion job based on the geology. So we are implementing those types of techniques really there at Antelope and in the Bakken core. Obviously, we are doing that in the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin as well. But, we are seeing a tremendous uplift in the productivity of the wells. Charles Meade : Got it. And so in the core as well as the extension -- antelope extension? DavidTrice: Yes. The completions aren't identical, like I said, because the geology varies throughout the area, but the key aspects of the completions will be implemented in the core and on down the road and in the non-core as well. Charles Meade : Got it. Thank you. And then, Bill, if I could try one more stab at this 2016 picture that obviously everyone is curious about but you guys are still working on it, if, I knew that you have this discipline returns focus. I'm wondering if you could foresee, if the forward curve does bear out, is there a time in 2016 when you think -- when you could foresee, having progressed enough on the efficiency and cost front that the returns would be sufficient that you would want to go ahead and accelerate completion activity even if we're still looking at $52 oil at the of 2016? Bill Thomas : Charles, we are going to \u2013 that's really good question. Really, even if oil stays where it is right now, we are going to go ahead and move forward in a pretty aggressive fashion on that DUC inventory in the first part of the year. That would be the highest return decision that we could make with our capital. We really thought through this and we worked on this plan back in late 2014 and really thought the consequences of all the different price scenarios as we considered it over kind of a two year period. And so we will be starting completion fairly aggressive on these DUCs early next year. Charles Meade : Thank you, Bill. I appreciate the comments. Operator : We will take our next question from Leo Mariani with RBC. Leo Mariani : Hi, guys. I was hoping for a little bit more color around the stagger stack activity here in Eagle Ford. Just trying to get a sense of what type of space between wellbores you guys are imploring and basically how long have you had some of these pilots on and when you think we might see results here? Billy Helms : Yes, Leo. This is Billy Helms. For our staggered W patterns that we are testing now we actually have several patterns across the field that we're testing as we speak. Just a reminder, in our last update on the Eagle Ford we have about 3.2 billion barrels of recoverable oil out of 7200 locations. That's an average of about 40 acre spacing. So obviously we're testing spacing. And these are W patterns in the lower Eagle Ford only. And so that spacing would be somewhat less than 40 acres each. Spacing pattern is slightly different. And we are just beginning to see some of those early results and actually just testing some of them haven't even come on production yet. So we still need some time to evaluate the production from these to understand what the impact is going to be. To the field, obviously, we are pretty optimistic based on some of the early results we have seen, but it is still early yet to really talk about the impact so we are encouraged though. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. I guess, I think a lot of people are curious about whether or not there is any decent kind of M&A your acreage acquisition opportunities out there on the market giving low prices? Can you guys kind of address your thoughts on the current M&A market? Billy Helms : Yes, Leo. This is Billy Helms, again. Just like many of our peer companies we are looking for those opportunities. I think you can see prices have been fairly good as far as people selling properties. I think evaluations are still pretty high. You have seen very few large M&A structures out there and I think we are kind of see the same thing. We have evaluated many things. I think what you will probably see more of is the smaller tactical acquisitions. That's kind of what we are maybe more focused on than any kind of large M&A things out there. We are seeing opportunities in different basins and we are actively looking at things we are still optimistic that we are going to be able to do some more small tactical acquisitions and build acreage positions in some of our key or emerging plays. We are having some success in just acquiring lease sold in some of our new emerging plays more so than we have in the past. So that's positive. So overall, I think right now the deals that are out there and available, there is still quite a bit of money chasing them. The prices are still pretty highly valued for the oil properties. So the key is trying to find things for us, for EOG the key is finding things that will add good valuable acreage that will compete with our existing inventory. But we're going to be very selective in what we chase. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Subash Chandra with Guggenheim Securities. Subash Chandra : Yes. Hi. Good morning. From your comment earlier that your base decline rate is you're making progress there et cetera. So is it fair to conclude that you are pretty well convinced the combination of lateral targeting and high density completion is enhancing oil recovery versus accelerated recovery of existing reserves? And, that the decline curve does not change on these completions versus the base completions? And then I have a follow-up. Bill Thomas : Yes, Subash. We are fairly convinced that we are not competing for a reserve with offset wells. And the reason is that these high density completions they do two things. They connect up more of the rock along the lateral and the second thing they do is, they really help contain the geometry of the frac. So the frac does not frac out as long it's far in a lateral extent or even if it doesn't frac vertically a great distance to connect up a significant amount of rock. So the fracs are not competing with each other for production. So we used to think, it has really been a shift in thinking, we used to think that these big fracs just connected up a lot of rock both laterally and vertically, but as we go forward and we change the design and we get more data we become more convinced that the frac is just, especially these high density fracs is really most effective very, very close to the wellbore. So that is really helping to boost our confidence and that we're going to add additional reserve potential going forward. Subash Chandra : Got it. Thank you. And my follow-up, it is something you have hesitated to answer before. I will try it again anyway. But is there any regional color you can give on production by basin in your guide, which areas might be raising and falling et cetera? Bill Thomas : No. Other than just generally, we don't guide by area. And we're not going to be doing that in the future, but you can generally, the Eagle Ford is obviously our strongest producer. The Bakken and the Permian are kind of second and third, but our activity, as you all know, in the Delaware Basin this year has doubled from last year. So we are growing volumes there rather rapidly in the Permian. Subash Chandra : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Cox with Deutsche Bank. Brian Cox : Great. Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe a segue one, my first question on the Permian. I don't need to be nitpicky, but it seemed like there was a relative shift away from the Leonard and towards the Wolfcamp and the Delaware Basin. Has there been any change the way you view the plays or is this just the Wolfcamp getting better and maybe just some overall commentary on your thoughts on the Delaware portfolio and potential for acceleration going forward? Billy Helms : Yes, Brian. This is Billy Helms. In the Delaware Basin certainly we are excited about all three of the major plays we have there. The Wolfcamp, the Bone Springs and the Leonard. For the Leonard it's more \u2013 it's more mature play for EOG. We have been operating there. We have more history. We understand the play a little bit more than we do some of the other plays. So we have shifted some of that activity to the Wolfcamp and Bone Springs. The Bone Springs probably has the biggest relative increase in capital this year. We completed quite a few wells in the first half. And then the Wolfcamp will be completing more wells in the second half of the year than we have in the first half, but in general the Wolfcamp, we are still learning a lot about it. We have got quite a few targets zones we are testing. We are testing various areas of the Wolfcamp play where we have acreage and we're testing some various spacing patterns. So we still have a lot to learn about the Wolfcamp. The other thing we're doing is with the Wolfcamp being in the deeper target we are gathering additional data on the Leonard and Bone Springs pay zones when we drill down through those on our way to the Wolfcamp. So by gathering additional petrophysical data and rock data we are better able to look at the variability of the pace actions and those two shallower pay zones and gives us a better idea about how to develop those, how to better target those and where the best upside might be. So it is kind of an overall approach to understand the play better. And that's one reason, major reason we have shifted more to the Wolfcamp. Brian Cox : Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe just an overall question on portfolio -- on the broader company portfolio. At this point we have had questions about the potential for acquisitions, but are there any interest on your end in divestitures, our international assets still considered core at this point or is there any other parts of the portfolio when you think about long-term portfolio optimization where you could be a potential seller? Bill Thomas : Brian, yes. We were always interested in upgrading our portfolio. And so every year we mix in property sales in our plan and this year is no different; 2016 will be no different. And we want to continue to divest -- think about divesting the properties that are less profitable obviously that don't fit our CapEx requirements. We have such an enormous high-graded inventory to develop we are always wanting to evaluate the potential of our existing properties. At this point in the company, we don't really have a lot of what I would call crummy properties or not quality properties. All of our properties are fairly quality, but we're going to be looking at continuing to upgrade our portfolio as we go forward. Brian Cox : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company. Pearce Hammond : Thank you and good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Bill, you had some good commentary, good Q&A earlier on 2016. I appreciate all that but just trying to distill some of the earlier questions this morning. Are you saying that you think if the current strip that EOG can keep exit rate 2015 production flat next year within cash flow? Bill Thomas : I think that is an accurate statement, Pearce. We are set up so well with the DUC inventory that even with the low prices we would have enough cash flow to keep production flat. Pearce Hammond : All right. Thank you for that. And then my follow-up, does you had the good news slide in your deck about compensation factor weightings for the E&P industry. And EOG had much less emphasis on production and reserve growth than peers and I assume obviously that leads into your decision to build the DUC inventory in the second half of this year higher than what you originally thought and be restrained on production because of the lower price environment that we are in. However, earlier on the call you stated that you would not have 2016 production decline year-over-year at the current strip. So if the returns for 2016 aren't that great and your compensation structure doesn't tell you to push production, why wouldn't you employ the same strategy in 2016 as you are employing in the second half of this year or is there a mechanical reason why you don't want production to decline? Is it problematic or is it just strictly cash flow needs? Bill Thomas : I think next year, Pearce, what we are saying is that even with the minimum, even with the low-price cash flow scenario the highest return investment we could make in the company would be to begin completing those DUCs and complete those DUCs earlier in the year versus spending that money on other things. So the quality of these DUCs is very high quality. So we have infrastructure in place. So that would be the highest return place to put the money. Pearce Hammond : Thank you, Bill. Operator : We will take our next question from Irene Haas with Wunderlich. Irene Haas : Yes. Hi. I specifically would like to ask you a question in North Delaware basin. I am noticing these wells are really very, very attractively priced like $7 million D&C. So question is, this is less overpressure, how many streams of casing do you use up there? And also these quotes we're looking at, are they in patch sort of patch drilling for pat mode, could we expect for the more reduction to come? And then alluding a little bit to something you said earlier, in the final development scheme which would be specing these really prolific zones together when you go into manufacturing mode that's probably something different from Eagle Ford. Gary Thomas : Hello, Irene. This is Gary Thomas. Yes, we are really pleased with the progress we have made there in the Delaware. But I would say it's really early on and you really, that was really good comment there as far as, yes, it is overpressured and we are still working on our wellbore geometry. So we have tested several different things. We believe that we will be able to get to a point where we are looking at two string design and just like we always do and like you have seen us do in the Eagle Ford and in the Bakken, we will just continue to reduce those days and we will reduce those costs. Because --, go ahead, Irene. Irene Haas : Go ahead. I\u2019m sorry. Gary Thomas : I was just going to say yes, you look through those various plays and we reduced our days anywhere from, oh goodness, 15% to 30%. And of course, that translates to cost. We are really making a lot of progress on the completion side in cost reduction. So yes, overall our total well cost has been reduced by about 20%. But again, it's less in the Delaware and we're just kind of turning that on [indiscernible]. Irene Haas : So I was wondering, for the two wells you quoted, they are really short lateral and they got some really kind of impressive rates. And so my question for you, are you targeting pure shale or are you looking for something a little different? GaryThomas: The Wolfcamp is, I would say it's, we're looking at whatever the best pay target is in those at this point in time. So in every one of these plays, as Bill mentioned earlier, we are spending a lot of time on targeting and trying to understand what the best part of that rock is, if it's a shale that's great. If it's not it's a silk stone, we look at those. So each area the target varies and so we spend quite a bit of time trying to understand what is the best target and then how do we best develop that? And the completion approach varies on each one of those. And the spacing approach might vary on each one of those. In general, our target windows are getting much more narrow than they had been in the past and we are seeing that by keeping the wellbores in the best rock longer and being able to more intentionally complete those wells in that best target productivity is better and the declines are lower. Irene Haas : Great. It sounds like a really surgical approach. Gary Thomas : We hope so. Irene Haas : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Phillips Johnston with Capital One. Phillips Johnston : Hi, guys. Thanks. My first question is on LOE costs. We saw a nice decline this quarter and the guidance suggests that the run rate should be in the low $6 range or so because which is also down from all of last year. We have seen most other companies report lower LOE costs as well. I'm just trying to gauge how sustainable to lower trend is for you guys. It looks like decline for EOG was less a function of fewer workovers, but rather a significant decline on the O&M front. You have referenced the impact of new infrastructure in the core of the Williston, but can you maybe talk about which components of O&M you are seeing costs decline and how much of those savings are secular versus cyclical? Gary Thomas : Yes. This is Gary Thomas. I'm sure you noticed that the first quarter and we commented on that last earnings call, it was above our guidance and our reason is we were a little bit late getting some of our infrastructure installed and that all did come on. So we had that infrastructure in place and our major plays, a few other things yet to be done there. So as far as driving our cost down the way we have here this second quarter, it's about half through having infrastructure, maybe a quarter of that just vendor cost reduction and other quarter would be just efficiency gains. So a large portion of that will be sustainable. It's really, we always make comments about our infrastructure and that spending, but it sure has been official for us getting our cost down and you will notice that our chart number 12 there, really pleased with us becoming more of liquids company and then being able to maintain our lifting cost fairly flat. Phillips Johnston : Sounds good. Gary Thomas : The second \u2013 Phillips Johnston : The second question, your production guidance suggests roughly a 2% up tick in [indiscernible] in the fourth quarter after three quarters of sequential declines. I just wanted to reconcile that up tick with the fact that you guys spent about 60% of your capital budget for the year in the first half and you also reduced the number of expected net completions in the Eagle Ford and the Permian by about 50 wells for the year. Gary Thomas : That kind of goes back to the time required from the point of -- yes, you initiate the well or even initiate the completion with us having several of these big part of our wells and now our own on pads, so you bring numbers of wells on. So yes, we are going to be bringing cost down and we will be able to maintain our production here with this second half as we have guided. Phillips Johnston : Okay. Just a follow-up on that. Are you able to say what percentage of the 405 net wells you plan to complete in Eagle Ford, Bakken, Permian, have you completed in the first half of the year? Gary Thomas : Yes. First half is roughly 55%, second half like 45%. Phillips Johnston : Okay. Great. Thanks guys. Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Thomas, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Bill Thomas : Yes. I did have a couple of final remarks. First of all, thank you for the great questions. I also want to thank all the employees of EOG for their tremendous efforts and contributions this year in making the EOG successful just did an outstanding job. My final message is this, I think you have heard it all through the call, the company continues to be focused on creating long-term shareholder value. We are not chasing short-term volumes in an oversupplied oil market. We have really focused on the fundamentals, improving returns, improving operating margins and building decades of high return growth potential. Our plan, EOGs plan is to deliver value to shareholders with high margin, high return production growth for years to come. So I want to thank everybody for listening and certainly thank you for your support. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's call.",

An updated IR presentation was posted to our Web site yesterday evening and we included fourth quarter and full year guidance in yesterday's press release. This morning Bill Thomas will start with a few opening remarks, followed by Billy Helms and David Trice to review operational results. I will then discuss EOG\u2019s financials, capital structure and hedge position and Bill will provide concluding remarks. Here is Bill Thomas. Bill Thomas : Thanks, Tim and good morning everyone. Our goal this year has been to transition the company to be successful in a low commodity price environment. To achieve this goal, our 2015 game plan is focused on the following objectives; one, maximize return on capital invested; two, improve well performance through technology and innovation; three, achieve significant cost reductions through sustainable efficiency gains; four, take advantage of opportunities to add drilling inventory; and five, maintain a strong balance sheet. As the year draws to a close, I am pleased to report we\u2019re right on track with our plan, we have maximized return on capital invested by directing capital to our best plays, the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware Basin. We are having a record year of well productivity improvements and cost reductions. Ongoing completions and the new work we are doing on targeting mean EOG continues to drill the strongest horizontal wells in the industry. As a result of these efforts, our largest and best assets now generate over 40% direct after tax rate of return with $50 oil. Making a solid return in horizontal oil at $50 is an excellent achievement. On the cost side, we\u2019re making substantial improvements. Year-over-year third quarter per unit lease operating expense was down 17%, per unit transportation was down 11% and total G&A was down 6%. In recent years we\u2019ve grown inventory at twice the rate of drilling, 2015 is no exception. This is a record year for adding high quality drilling potential. Last quarter, we increased our Bakken and Three Forks\u2019 net potential reserves by 600 million barrels of oil equivalent. This quarter we increased our Delaware Basin net potential reserves by 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. As you read in our press release we made three tactical acquisitions in the Delaware Basin adding significant high quality drilling potential. In total, we added over 1.6 billion barrels of net reserve potential and over 3,000 net locations this year and we\u2019ve achieved this incredible growth through our reserve and drilling potential, while maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. To summarize our progress report; in 2015, we maximized return on capital invested, added significant future growth potential and maintained a strong balance sheet. All year long our focus has been on the improving fundamentals and building future potential instead of chasing short-term volume growth. We believe this demonstrates that EOG\u2019s priorities are squarely focused on returns and creating long-term shareholder value. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Billy Helms to discuss the big news this quarter our resource upgrade to the Delaware Basin. Billy Helms : Thanks Bill. Last night we announced a significant upgrade to our Delaware Basin assets. We increased the estimated net resource potential to 2.35 billion barrels of oil equivalent that is a 74% increase from our resource estimate just two years go. The expanded resource provides 2,200 additional net locations adding to what was already decades of drilling inventory. The primary driver of this upgrade is our constant focus on improving well results through the application of technology and targeting. We've a proven track record of increasing in a play\u2019s potential and this quarter our success is evident in the Wolfcamp and Second Bone Spring Sand plays. In the Wolfcamp we\u2019re adding net potential reserves of 500 million barrels of oil equivalent and almost 1,000 net wells. We now estimate the Wolfcamp's total net potential reserves to be 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent from 2,050 net drilling locations. This estimate is based on a highly detailed evaluation of multiple distinct intervals within a geologically complex basin like other plays we've found that by first identifying and then targeting discrete intervals we can dramatically improve the performance of the wells and ultimately the recovery from the reservoir. There are several potential targets within the Wolfcamp and we had successful tests in at least three. This resource estimate includes wells plays and these tested intervals across all of our acreage with well spacing that varies from 660 feet to 1,320 feet between wells in the same zone.  To summarize it more simply this resource estimate assumes at least one productive interval across all of our acreage with wells spaced about 700 feet apart. Similar to other resource plays we\u2019re testing powder spacing with encouraging results. Last quarter we drilled a two well pattern on 880 foot spacing Dragon 36 State 701H and 702H. These wells are at these rates averaged over 2,300 barrels of oil per day. This quarter we drilled a two well pattern in the same area on closer spacing at 500 feet apart the Brown Bear 36 State 702H and 703H. Their initial production averaged over 3,000 barrels of oil per day per well. We\u2019re drilling wells closer while maintaining or improving their EURs. Another highlight in the third quarter was the Thor 21 702H. This is an industry record horizontal Wolfcamp well with a 30 day IP of 30,490 barrels of oil equivalent per day. All these Wolfcamp wells are in the oil window which we identified late last year, wells in this window produce at least 50% oil versus 31% in the combo play with this resource update we initiated a separate Wolfcamp oil window gross EUR of 750 MBoe per well. Wells completed in the Combo area maintained their previously estimated gross EUR of 900 MBoe per well. We\u2019re encouraged by these results and continue to test and evaluate tighter well spacing patterns along with multiple targets. With approximately two-thirds of our acreage in the oil window this play will generate very competitive returns during this period of low commodity prices. In the Second Bone Springs Sand, we initiated our net resource potential estimate to 500 million barrels of oil equivalent and 1,250 net well locations. Like the Wolfcamp this estimate is a result of a detailed evaluation of recent completions in multiple targets that presumes at least one productive target across all of our acreage. The well count constitutes actual sticks on map locations and while well spacing varies across the play by area and target in general it averages about 850 feet. We first discussed this oil target last year and are very encouraged with initial well results. The Second Bone Springs Sand provides an attractive third leg to our Delaware Basin activity. The Leonard is the most material of our Delaware Basin plays and we continue to make progress improving results. A recent four well package mentioned in the press release the Hawk 35 Fed 7 through 10H was completed on 500 foot spacing with an average IP of 1,615 barrels of oil per day these wells are producing on par with net wells drilled on water spacing last year. Again this is the testament to the progress we've made on completion technology in the Delaware Basin. Moving forward we expect to develop this resource using 300 to 500 foot spacing. We had one other significant success in the Delaware Basin last quarter. Last night we announced that through three transactions we added 26,000 net acres in Loving County, Texas, and Lea County New Mexico. Since the start of the year we've mentioned our heightened interest in acquisition opportunities driven by the oil price down cycle, while we didn't initially rule out corporate M&A we quickly focused our efforts on targeting smaller more tactical acquisitions. These types of opportunities are more likely to compete with our existing high quality inventory because the acreage is mostly undeveloped and is concentrated in the core of these plays. We are already drilling this highly prospective acreage and the potential reserve estimates from these acquisitions are included in our updated Delaware Basin numbers. EOG\u2019s Delaware Basin potential is rapidly increasing and we expect this asset to be a significant top-tier contributor to the future growth of the company. In the Eagle Ford after five years and three resource upgrades to this world class play, we are still excited about the learning and the technical progress we make every quarter. We continue to test and evaluate the Lower Eagle Ford W pattern mentioned in last quarter\u2019s call. While the W pattern is not new to the industry, there is one significant difference to the spacing test, the vertical spacing between target intervals is not necessarily an arbitrary distance, but rather is determined by certain characteristics of the rock. Our W pattern test is specifically designed to take advantage of technical findings from the work we are doing around targeting. We started this targeting work by analyzing 60 unique well characteristics from hundreds of recently drilled Eagle Ford wells. From these 60, we identified 12 characteristics that are present in our best wells by incorporating this data into our 3D seismic and petrophysical data we determined that the Lower Eagle Ford may have two sweet spot intervals. Please be sure to look for the slide in our IR deck that graphically demonstrates this finding. The laterals in our W pattern test are geo-steered to very specific areas that meet specific criteria. These targets can be as narrow as 20 feet. Initial results from these tests are promising as we gather more data, conduct more tests and evaluate the results, we will bring you updates. I\u2019ll turn it over to David Trice to discuss the Bakken and the Rockies. David Trice : Thanks Billy. In the Rockies we continue to maximize the value of our acreage position by using enhanced completion techniques and lowering capital and operating expenses dramatically. As you may recall last quarter,we announced that we areimplementing high density completions in some Rockies\u2019 wells that are similar to the completions currently used in the Eagle Ford, while the geology varies from play-to-play and even within the same play we see the upside in our ability to increase value through high density and integrated completion techniques. In the Bakken we are focused on completing infill wells in our core area using our latest completion technology. Even though these infill wells are among oil producing wells our integrated completion approach ensures that we effectively stimulate the reservoir and deliver high rate of return and maximum value. An example of infill wells in our core acreage is a three well pad on the Parshall 3029 unit. This pad came online with an average initial rate of over 1,800 barrels of oil per day and 1 million cubic feet per day of rich natural gas per well. These wells are spaced just 500 feet apart and use shorter laterals that average less than 6,000 feet. Our latest Bakken wells are averaging just 7.6 days spud-to-TD for an 8,400 foot lateral and cost $7 million. This is a reduction of 20% from 2014. In addition, we have lowered LOE in the Bakken core area up to $5 a barrel through infrastructure investment such as water gathering systems. All of these improvements will allow us to maximize the value of this 1 billion barrel equivalent asset and deliver solid returns even in a low oil price environment. In the DJ Basin, we continue to refine our drilling techniques and implement high density completions. Long-term data is needed to fully evaluate the results however initial data indicates improved performance. In the third quarter, we brought online a four wall pad that targeted the Codell Sandstone. These wells are located in the windy 1705 and 1720 units and produced an average initial rate in excess of 1,100 barrels of oil per day with 600 Mcf per day of rich natural gas per well using an average lateral length of 8,700 feet. Recent well cost in the Codell are averaging just $7 million for a 9,400 foot lateral with the latest well performance in lower well cost the Codell is delivering a direct A tax rate of return approaching 30%. As greater efficiency continues to drive down cost, we believe we can achieve a target well cost of $6.1 million. These successes in the Codell are another example of how we are transitioning EOG to be successful in a low commodity price environment. The Powder River Basin remains a core position for EOG, although capital spending is lower this year, we continue to work the technical details, block up acreage and to secure regulatory permits. All of this will set up the Powder River Basin as a future growth engine for EOG. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure. Tim Driggers : Thanks David. For the third quarter capitalized interest was $9.8 million. Total cash, exploration and development expenditures were $970 million excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $51 million. There were $368 million of property acquisitions during the quarter. Year-to-date total cash exploration and development expenditures were $3.7 billion excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $253 million. During the third quarter EOG incurred $4.1 billion in non-cash property impairment charges net of tax. The impairments were due to declines in the forward commodity prices and were related to some of our legacy natural gas and marginal liquid assets. At the end of September total debt outstanding was $6.4 billion for debt-to-capitalization ratio of 33%. We had $743 million of cash on hand giving us a non-GAAP net debt of $5.7 billion and a net debt to total cap ratio of 30%. Approximately 5% of the 8% increase from the end of June was due to the non-cash impairment recognized this quarter. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 35% and the deferred tax ratio was 101%. In terms of our hedge positions for the period November 1 through December 31, 2015 EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 10,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of $89.98 per barrel. In addition for November 2015 EOG has put options in place which established a core price of $45 per barrel or 82,500 barrels of oil per day. For the month of December 2015 EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 175 MMBtu per day at a weighted average price of $4.51 per MMBtu. Now turn I\u2019ll turn it back to Bill. Billy Helms : Thanks, Tim. Now a quick word on the macro. Our view has not changed the industry is becoming more disciplined. The U.S. is on an oil production decline based on the EIE data and could exit the year 500,000 to 600,000 barrels of oil per day lower than peak production recorded in April. Worldwide longer-term projects are being cut, but we agree with the consensus view that $40 to $50 oil is not sustainable and supply demand is in the process of slowly rebalancing. Regarding 2016 although our planning process won't be complete until the beginning of the year when we have a better view of oil prices, I'll share a little color on our situation. EOG is uniquely positioned for strong performance next year. We\u2019ll enter 2016 with a large high quality inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells and we've few capital commitments, therefore we have flexibility with respect to our CapEx program. The highest return use of our capital next year will be to complete many of our DUCs in the first half of the year. This will allow us to have a strong start to 2016. As always we've no interest in outspending and expect to balance CapEx and discretionary cash flow. Our focus will be on increasing capital returns, increasing the quality of our inventory and reducing operating cost. 2015 is rapidly coming to a close and I could not be prouder of how the EOG team has been executing on our plan. As I have said at the start of the year I've seen many downturns in my 36 years with the company, each time EOG emerges on the other side in better shape, this is exactly how 2015 is playing out. But there is one primary take away from the call today. EOG is quickly adapting to be successful in a low oil price environment. We\u2019re not depending on a rebound to high oil prices instead we\u2019re making the most of the current price environment by focusing on improving fundamentals and building future potential. In fact 2015 has been EOG's best year in terms of the magnitude of improvements in the Company. Regardless of where we\u2019re in the commodity cycle EOG is committed to return focused capital discipline year-after-year. The Company remains focused on creating long-term shareholder value. Thanks for listening. And now we\u2019ll go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] Questions are limited to one question and one follow-up question. We will take as many questions as time permits. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Leo Mariani with RBC. Leo Mariani : Wanted to touch base on the enhanced completions, it sounds like you're starting to use these in the Delaware Basin, here. Obviously you've had a lot of success in other plays, any reason to think that these won't give you a nice improvement in economics here? Bill Thomas : Leo we\u2019ll ask Billy Helms to comment on that. Billy Helms : Yes Leo, this is Billy Helms. As you mentioned we view these enhanced completions or these high density completions in other plays largely starting in the Eagle Ford where we have certainly demonstrated the uplift associated with executing these high density completions. We are transferring this technology to other plays including the Delaware Basin and I think the results are very encouraging with what we are seeing there and we are incorporating our high density completions along with are focused on targeting. And the targeting I think is going to also make a huge difference in the performance of the wells. I\u2019d say in the Delaware Basin is still early on and we\u2019re evaluating both those two new approaches as well as spacing test in each one of our target intervals and we hope to be able to give you some very positive news in the future on the performance of those efforts. Leo Mariani : I guess just turning to the Eagle Ford here, just trying to get a sense of where you are at in the process of testing the W patterns, and the stagger stacks here? And are you able to kind of see any results at this point, and when do you think we'll have a better update on that? Billy Helms : Yes Leo this is Billy Helms again, on the Eagle Ford we\u2019ve actually got several tests underway using this W pattern test and the W pattern just to make sure we are certain about the explanation that is largely and it is only in the lower Eagle Ford that we are doing the W pattern. So we\u2019re not -- we\u2019re just focused solely on the W pattern in the Lower Eagle Ford and that\u2019s largely been the focus as a result of our targeting efforts as I started in the Lower Eagle Ford, we identified through our analysis of all the core data and the petrophysical data that we have that there are two sweet spot intervals that we wanted to target. It's still early on, we\u2019ve just started testing those and we\u2019re testing those in several areas across the field but we are encouraged with their early results. The early results look to indicate that these two areas, these two sweet spot intervals aren\u2019t interfering with each other during the production phase. So that gives us a lot of encouragement for additional resource that we\u2019ll be able to capture in the future it is still early yet to really quantify the results from that test, but I\u2019d say we\u2019re optimistic about the results. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio : Bill, let me start off on a macro strategy question. You are one of the best, if not the best on conventional operator, deep well inventory, and a relatively bullish outlook on the commodity. Philosophically, what does your reacceleration look like? Will you be pacing activity within cash flow neutrality on a few quarter lag, and, given the efficiencies that have accelerated, does it change your view on a peak rig count being significantly lower than prior rig count in a recovery scenario? Bill Thomas : Yes I think the key for us going in next year the advantage we have that we didn\u2019t have in the early part of 2015 is we have an incredible amount of flexibility with our capital. It's really, we just don\u2019t have commitments to international, we don\u2019t have lease retention, we don\u2019t have as much heavy infrastructure especially first part of the year and we don\u2019t have a lot of service contracts in place. So we\u2019re free to really put our money on the best rate of return projects, or wells and the Company and we\u2019re also free to vary that capital spend rate based on the commodity price and we can react very quickly. So as we said we\u2019re not going to -- we won\u2019t give specific growth numbers, or production numbers, or CapEx numbers until February because we\u2019re very committed to staying within cash flow. So that will really determine our view of -- basically we will use the strip process plus form factor that we have on the macro to kind of determine our CapEx for the year. And then we will vary that according to the commodity prices as the year goes through. So it will be a very flexible year and -- but our focus will be of course on increasing returns, increasing the quality of our inventory and continuing to prove up new things. Evan Calio : And it sounds like DUCs will be your first lever there. Let me ask my second or follow-up question on the Delaware. You're making significant progress. How long do you think it takes to get to the same level of technological maturity that you have in the Eagle Ford, where you're satisfied in your ability to drill within zone, optimize completion design? Yes. I'll leave it there. Thanks. Billy Helms : Okay yes Evan this is Billy Helms. Yes for the Delaware Basin as you mentioned there we\u2019re earlier in the ability to really get into a good development program there. I think the key thing you have to realize about the Delaware Basin as opposed to the Eagle Ford is the Delaware Basin is a highly complex basin the geology changes quite a bit across the basin. There are multiple targets, multiple formations and we've done a -- our team out there has done a great job of really delineating their understanding of the play with the data that we have and we\u2019re always collecting more and more data as we develop the program. So I would say just to bullet down to maybe base ball terms we\u2019re probably maybe a third inning on the Delaware Basin as opposed to sixth or seventh inning maybe on the Eagle Ford for instance. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : I'd like to dig in a bit on the -- on the advanced completions and the well productivity that you cited as one of the reasons for your oil volumes coming in over guidance, I know that the most prominent thing we see is these great IP rates that you have turned in, but the other thing that I believe you've mentioned and we certainly see with the results on these Thor wells that, particularly for those Thor wells, the 30-day rate is at least as remarkable as the IP rate. And I'm curious when you look at the effect that these advanced completions are having on your production profile, should we be thinking about the beat in 3Q being a function of wells that were completed in 3Q, or is it more a function of the wells that were completed in the first half of the year that are holding up better with lower decline, that really are leading to beats like this? Billy Helms : Yes Charles this is Billy Helms. Ys I think that\u2019s a good question, I think it\u2019s maybe a factor of both certainly the targeting and the high density completions are making a huge difference as evidenced in as what you just mentioned in the Thor well and the other Wolfcamp wells we completed in the last quarter, and certainly those are new wells and we\u2019re seeing vast improvements in the productivity of the wells, and they are sustaining themselves as evidenced by the 30 day average that you mentioned on the Thor well. And we've been doing this for a while longer in some of the other plays mainly the Eagle Ford and yes we\u2019re seeing the decline as not as steep on those wells, so it has an overall flattening effect on our decline rates on all these programs so we\u2019re seeing the benefit in those two areas. Charles Meade : So it's both. And then, if I could ask a question about the Delaware Basin acquisitions, I know that this is a little bit of a change in MO from you, who you have historically have been focused really on organic leasing. Should we be thinking about these acquisitions or further acquisitions like this as the closest you can get to organic leasing in the Delaware Basin, given the legacy of vertical production out there? And I suppose as a follow-on to that should we be expecting more similarly sized deals from you guys going forward? Bill Thomas : Charles this is Bill. I think I'll ask Billy to comment a bit on that. But I think it will be a combination, we\u2019re doing a lot of little deals along with the bigger deals, and so block enough acreage sharing acreage with other operators and slopping it out and some drilled aren\u2019t deals and then we\u2019re also buying some small fracs from different operators. So it will be a combination of multiple things. As Billy said we pretty much ruled out any of the bigger M&A possibilities and mainly we ruled that out on asset quality, it didn't come in comparable to what we already have. So we don't really expect to be pursuing anything like that, Billy you want to add anything? Billy Helms : Yes the only thing I would add Charles to that as I think it, -- the acquisitions we've done are largely staying within our focus of growing organically. The difference would be that the organic growth in new plays we\u2019re still able to go out and get ahead of the competition and acquire positions in new plays fairly cheaply. In the Delaware Basin it's a very mature basin, it is a lot of ownership, legacy ownership has been out there for years and years as everybody knows. So one way to gain entry into acreage that we see quite a bit of upside is through these tactical acquisitions and I would add to Bill's comment we\u2019re being highly selective in what we acquire. And so we passed up several opportunities that have been transacted that we just passed on and we did focus on these three tactical acquisitions that we are very encouraged with and as a matter of fact we already have drilling operations going on, on the acreage that we acquired. So we\u2019re going to stay selective and continue to grow each of one of these plays in whatever manner we feel like we can. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : Yes a question on the acquisitions, who were the counter parties, were they privates or publics or landowners? Bill Thomas : They were selective companies and we\u2019re not going to get into details about the deals we have done and certainly not again into the details about the things we\u2019ve looked at, it's just something we don\u2019t really comment on. But I\u2019d say they are all existing companies, strong companies that we\u2019ve done business with in the past and hope to continue to do business with in the future and we\u2019ll look at all of the opportunities whether it is small private companies or larger public companies for opportunities to add to our positions. Bob Brackett : And then a follow-up on next year, how do you think about debt to cap, and is it a level that you're happy with or is some of next year's cash flow going to debt reduction? Bill Thomas : Well yes Bob, we\u2019re very committed to keeping a very strong balance sheet. So we\u2019ll not stretch it much further than then it really is. Although I will say this, we will continue to look for acquisitions and not likely to find a big one, but if we find things that are attractive to us we will use -- evaluate all the options that we have to acquire that. And so the Company is in fantastic shape to do that. Of course the goal for us has always been to generate free cash flow, to continue working on the dividend down the road too we needed a little bit better commodity price, than we have right now to accomplish that, but that will be a goal for us going forward. We also continue to market non-core properties that has been an ongoing process for the Company for years. So we\u2019re in the process of doing that again this year too. So we\u2019ve got multiple ways to continue to keep the net debt of the Company low and to really preserve our balance sheet. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate : Bill, within the scheme of living within cash flow, obviously you've had a fairly large international project pretty much close to conclusion now, a lot of exploration spending and a fair amount of midstream spending. Just in the grand scheme of things, within the different buckets can you generalize whether you will see an incremental swing back towards completions within the context of living within cash flow, in terms of your capital spending? Bill Thomas : Yes, Doug specifically, yes for 2016 with the very large uncompleted well inventory certainly the focus of the CapEx and that will be the highest return thing we can invest in next year, we will be on completing that inventory and lower that inventory down. So it gives us a lot of flexibility because we just don\u2019t have always all these other big commitments and that will certainly give us I think stronger capital efficiency, a very-very high return on our capital next year. Doug Leggate : I guess not to push the point, Bill, but I guess I was kind of hoping you might quantify order of magnitude. Exploration, IOC, midstream I'm guessing it's close to 20%-25% of this year's budget. I mean could it be that big of a swing in terms of incremental completion capital? Bill Thomas : No, I think the -- we call that kind of the indirect that will be roughly about the same percentage that it has been in the past. Maybe not quite as much in the first part of the year but certainly we\u2019ve got things that we need to do in those areas. As far as international projects, we don\u2019t have many significant commitments next year on international it's actually less I think than historically. Let me ask Gary Thomas to comment and chime here and give a little bit more color on that. Gary Thomas : One thing on the indirects and you talked about the midstream it will be benefitted next year with us having these doubts because they are in areas where we have quite a lot of operations currently, so we will have less infrastructure requirements just to hook those wells up. So it would be a little less than what we have experienced 2014-2015. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from David Tameron with Wells Fargo. David Tameron : Let me run with that same theme. If I think about maintenance CapEx, I think you have thrown out a number before, $4.8 billion. One, is that the right number? And two, obviously that number goes lower. Can you give us any framework around that? Bill Thomas : That\u2019s when you look at what we are spending now and that came up and we\u2019re looking at spending $1 billion this quarter and probably somewhere around maybe 900 million for next quarter, this fourth quarter. So it could be talked out there has been maintenance capital but yes when we go into \u201916 we\u2019ll not have to be spending money associated with locations with the drilling with quite a lot associated with these stuffs. So that will probably reduce per well about 30% but the 4.8 is -- our maintenance capital was quite a bit less than that. David Tameron : Yes, yes I think that was a prior number, okay that's helpful. And if I think about the DUC -- the pace of the DUC drawdown, I think before we talked about mid-year, are you just going to take them down -- should we think about it systematically, taking down 200 over the first six months of the year, or how should we -- can you give us any framework around just the pace or the timing of that? Billy Helms : Yes David let me answer that one. We've a lot of flexibility, so really the pace of our spending and the pace of our activity will be very much guided by the commodity price and the resulting cash flow. So that\u2019s the reason we\u2019re not giving any really details because we want to work our plan more every time we work our plan it gets a little better so we\u2019re very encouraged about that, and then we certainly need to have a lot better insight on what the cash flow and commodity price would be. So it will be regulated by really the oil price. Operator : For our next question we\u2019ll go to Kevin Smith with Raymond James. Kevin Smith : It seems the industry playbook is fairly standard with drilling longer laterals and pumping more sand in your completions, but you were able to deliver record-breaking well results in the Wolfcamp with a lateral less than 5,000 feet, is it fair to say then that EOG believes completion and maybe zone landing are more incrementally economic than just drilling longer laterals? Billy Helms : Yes Kevin this is Billy Helms. That\u2019s exactly what we would say is that the completion and targeting are making a huge difference regardless of lateral length and we\u2019re not focused on drilling necessarily longer laterals to make better wells we\u2019re focused on increasing our rate of return, driving rate of return through the innovation and application of technology which includes how we analyze and figure out where the place to lateral in each of these pay objectives that\u2019s a big part of why the productivity on these wells is increasing every quarter is that continual focus on those two things, the technology around completions and also the landing spot that we\u2019re working on with our geological effort. Kevin Smith : And then lastly, thank you for that, but given the Wolfcamp drilling results, does the Delaware Basin start competing with capital versus the Bakken or other plays? Billy Helms : Yes Kevin this is Billy Helms again. Yes I think while it's still early to think about what that\u2019s going to mean for next year's capital allocation. I think if you look back to this year, this year the Delaware Basin was the only area that saw an increase in capital from 2014. And we\u2019ll certainly assess the way that looks. I would say we\u2019re very encouraged with the productivity gains we've made and the progress we\u2019re seeing on that play to be able to generate growth for the Company, and we\u2019ll evaluate our options on how we allocate capital as we get closer to the year-end. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company. Pearce Hammond : Bill thanks for your comments on 2016. My first question is if you match CapEx and cash flow, do you expect to deliver oil production growth in 2016? Bill Thomas : Yes Pearce again that\u2019s a good question, because we don't know what that cash flow and CapEx will be yet because we will set that based on the oil price and that\u2019s what we\u2019re -- wanted to get a little bit better deal on down the road. We certainly are in a position next year to have a very strong performance. And if we have the support from the oil price the Company is in great shape. So but we\u2019ll just have to wait to give any specific numbers until February. Pearce Hammond : And then my follow-up is, when it's time to ramp production for EOG and the rest of the industry, are you concerned about the deliverability of the service industry, given the sizable headcount reductions across the states and maybe some degradation on some of the pieces of equipment? Gary Thomas : Pearce this is Gary Thomas. And yes there is some concern with that and we've talked quite a lot about that and maintaining the activity level that we have maintained and what we've planned to do in 2016 we\u2019re focused on those companies that are really quality companies and have been tremendous partners to EOG and we\u2019re spreading that word trying to keep them in good shape. So it's going to be hard on the industry. I believe you're correct there, but I think we\u2019re positioned so that we\u2019ll be able to get the top services and hopefully we have got a lot of self sourcing going on with EOG anyway. So I think we can really ramp-up readily when we see commodity prices improve. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd : If I could maybe follow up with a couple questions on the Delaware Basin. I appreciate your earlier comments about uncertainties in terms of relative capital allocation across the portfolio next year. Maybe, as you think about relative capital allocation within the Delaware Basin, I mean, is there a pecking order in terms of which of the three plays have the best rates of return at this point, and how much does infrastructure at this point dictate relative activity between Leonard versus Bone Spring, versus Wolfcamp? Billy Helms : Yes Ryan this is Billy Helms. So yes, we\u2019ve got three really good plays out there, the Leonard, the Bone Springs and the Wolf Camp. And what we\u2019re doing right now is we\u2019re focusing most of our activity on the lower most of those zones to Wolf Camp for a couple of reasons; one, the Wolf Camp is generating really high rate of returns that are competitive with pretty much every play in the Company. And then two, it really gives us by drilling the deeper objective it gives us a chance to evaluate the shallower objectives as we drill through them. So we can gather log data and other data that we need to really help delineate the shallower plays and that will help us improve our returns on those plays and make them even stronger when we start our development in those plays. On infrastructure, we\u2019re focusing most of our activity in areas where we already have existing infrastructure. As we step out and test some of the new areas, we\u2019re certainly going to have to build out an infrastructure in those areas. But right now most of our activity is in areas where have infrastructure available to us. Ryan Todd : And do you have sufficient infrastructure to allocate materially more capital going forward, or is this still a waiting game, I guess? Lance Terveen : Ryan, this is Lance. When we look at their takeaway capacity it's been very encouraging. I mean the midstream operators are really fall through with investment and we\u2019re going to be connected to all that near-term capacity, so, and just to follow-up what Billy said, we\u2019re in great shape as we\u2019re sitting today. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Irene Haas from Wunderlich. Irene Haas : My question has to do with your targeting effort. I wish there's a fancy schmancy name for it, but it's really intriguing. So on slide 9, you show that there's 12 parameters that you have identified. You sum it together, and that kind of gives you the targeted zone. And my question for you is, some those parameters, can you share a little bit like, are they porosity, permeability as such, and is it hard to replicate? My question really stems from you said in Eagle Ford, you're in the sixth inning, so in terms of just data density you have a whole lot to work on. Would it be a harder exercise to pull off in Delaware Basin? And are there anybody else trying to do this? Is this expensive, or is it data intensive, or simply they need brain cells? And lastly, who does the number crunching for you? Do you actually do this analysis in house, or do you farm it out to a third-party? David Trice : Yes Irene, this is David Trice. A lot of this that we\u2019re presenting there is proprietary data. So we will just give you an example and this is -- a lot of this is built up, we\u2019ve been pursuing these resource plays for over a decade and so a lot of this is just it means that we\u2019ve learned over the years and we have some of the very best people in the industry. And so we\u2019ve been able to put this together through this integrated approach between our G&G guys, our petrophysicists and the engineers. And this is just kind of a core competency of EOG how we approach things. And so really we can\u2019t really give a lot more detail than that, but it is part of our culture. Irene Haas : So what you're saying is it's kind of hard to replicate for a multitude of reasons, and is it easier to do it on Eagle versus Delaware, because of data density, or are you able to forecast because you've got such a great global database on every single shale? David Trice : Yes, I mean if you think about it, we\u2019re in really the three major plays so we have a lot of good data throughout all those plays and we\u2019ve got a lot of good rock data, petrophysical data and everything. And so we have -- we\u2019re testing so many different targets and we just have a lot of information and we are able to apply it from play-to-play. And so I do think as you look towards a play like the Delaware Basin we\u2019re -- you do have multiple targets, a lot of that information is going to be even more critical there. So we do think it is something that is very-very difficult to replicate. Operator : We\u2019ll go now to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer : I wanted to just follow up on the questions with regards to 2016 and growth. Just looking at the third quarter here of 2015, where you spent about $1 billion ex the acreage acquisition, you grew your oil volumes, and what I think you're highlighting here is you're going to be more flexible because of the DUC inventory, because you have some of those contracts rolling off. What are the impediments to showing perhaps not just the growth that we saw in US oil volumes in Q3, but even greater growth next year, assuming we're in a $40 to $50 environment? It seems that rate of return is not a question, unless you think it is. What are the impediments to showing -- to showing growth, since we just saw it here in the third quarter? Gary Thomas : Brian this is Gary Thomas. And it really just goes back to the cash flow and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working so to balance and we\u2019re still working through that and yes the wells we've drilled and completed that will be being official to us but then just as data we were just mentioning we have these new plays and we\u2019re in the experimental phase as well and we've to gather data and have to run quite a number of logs and also there is just a whole combination of things. So we\u2019re still factoring all those in to see what kind of volume growth we could have with particular oil prices in 2016, but cash flow driven. Brian Singer : And then with regards to the technological improvement here, and the higher density completions in particular which do cost some amount more capital, can you talk about what you would expect to see in terms of incremental EURs in places like the Delaware, the Eagle Ford, and the Bakken? And whether, that is all upside from here and represents an increase in recovery rate? Billy Helms : Yes Brian this is Billy Helms. I would say that we haven't really quantified in most of plays yet just the magnitude of the improvement we\u2019ll hope to see in EURs from testing the new high density completions as well as the targeting efforts. The numbers we've given you to-date are based on the results we have and have data on but as we continue to make improvements in both targeting and the high density completions we\u2019re very encouraged with the early results and as we get more data we\u2019ll certainly update its impact on the resource assessments. So we just need some production time to evaluate that data as well as the different spacing tests that we\u2019re conducting throughout the Company. And we\u2019ll give you more color on that as we get data. Operator : We\u2019ll go now to Subash Chandra with Guggenheim. Subash Chandra : Yes, my first question is how do you think about your base decline rate starting in \u201916 versus \u201915? Bill Thomas : Yes Subash this is Bill Thomas. The decline rate in the Company is lowering every year because of we get more old wells versus new wells so the production base gets more mature that\u2019s the major driver. And then the completion technology is a very significant driver and the quality of the rock that you drill the lateral in as that improves the decline rate lower. So we've got multiple things going on, as far as 2016 versus \u201915 it will be lower and particularly when you slow growth down say versus 2014 we grew at 31% well in 2015 our decline rate was higher because then it would be in 2016 because of we grew production and added a lot more new wells in 2014. So as the activity, number of wells as you complete each year as that is lower and then we\u2019ll be coming off a flat growth year in 2015, so it will be significantly lower than what it was in 2014. Subash Chandra : And my follow-up is, in the Permian plays, between the three that you've mentioned, how do we think about the water oil ratios, either in absolute terms or relative to one other? And that's formation water? Billy Helms : Yes Subash this is Billy Helms. Certainly that\u2019s something we look at on each one of these plays and I would say it varies by target interval but it also varies by where you are in the basin. So all of these plays have some element of formation water and so it's really important that you understand due to the detailed geological work that we had done to really delineate what we think are the sweet spots and that\u2019s where our efforts are focused on picking up acreage in what we do considering the sweet spots, we\u2019re being there very selective about where we drill and where we increased our position in those areas. And I would say the Leonard play probably has a little bit higher water cut than the Wolfcamp in general, but every play has some element of water production. So you need to have infrastructure to go along with that to make sure that your cost over the life of the play are measurable and competitive with other plays that we have in the Company. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to Mr. Thomas for any concluding remarks. Bill Thomas : Thank you for your questions and again I want to really thank the EOG employees\u2019 who have done a fantastic job this year in giving the Company reset to be very successful on the low commodity prices. So the combination of the best in class assets, technology, low cost, and organic exploration and all this is driven by EOG\u2019s organization and culture are we believe very sustainable competitive advantages as we go forward. And this powerful combination will allow EOG to be one of the highest return producers and more importantly we believe we\u2019re going to be more than competitive going forward in the world oil market. So we want to thank everybody for listening and especially thank you for your support. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.",

An updated IR presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening, and we included guidance for the first and full-year 2016 in yesterday's press release. This morning, we'll discuss topics in the following order. Bill Thomas will review 2015 highlights and our 2016 capital plan. David Trice and Billy Helms will review operational results in year-end reserve replacement data. Then I will discuss EOG's financials, capital structure, and hedge positioning. And Bill will provide concluding remarks. Here's Bill Thomas. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Tim. EOG is committed to a returns-focused capital discipline, and we've demonstrated that commitment in 2015 with a simple decision. After four years of 40% compound annual oil growth, we slammed on the brakes and decided to defer production growth. It was an easy decision. Outspending cash flow to grow oil into an oversupplied market makes no sense. Rather than chasing production growth through the down cycle, we focused on three main goals. First, we concentrated more than ever on resetting the company to be successful in a lower commodity price environment by reducing cost and improving well productivity. Second, we wanted to add high-quality drilling inventory through organic exploration and tactical acquisitions. And most importantly, our third goal was to protect our balance sheet. As a result, EOG had a record year in reducing costs, improving well productivity, and adding new drilling potential to the company. We accomplished all this and ended the year with one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. Here are a few highlights from the year. We reduced capital more than 40% from 2014 and maintained flat U.S. oil production. Total cash operating cost per unit decreased 17% compared to 2014. We drilled two industry record wells, one each in the Bakken and Delaware Basin Wolfcamp. We added a company record 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent and net resource potential and over 3,000 net locations. That means we replaced more than six times the inventory that we drilled in 2015. And we acquired 34,000 net acres in the sweet spot of the Delaware Basin. 2015 changed how we think about EOG's position in the industry long term. It's no longer enough to be the low-cost producer in U.S. horizontal shale. EOG's goal is to be a competitive low-cost oil producer in the global market. Now let's talk about our plan in 2016. Our first objective this year is to achieve strong returns on our capital program through sustainable profitability gains. In order to maximize return on capital invested, we are shifting into what we call premium drilling mode. Like last year, we will concentrate our efforts in capital in our top plays, the Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin, Bakken, and Rockies. The difference in 2016 is that we have the flexibility to direct capital only towards our large inventory of premium quality wells. Premium inventory is defined as wells that generate direct after-tax rates of return of at least 30% at $40 oil. We have identified over 2 billion barrels of equivalent of net resource potential and 3,200 net drilling locations that meet this hurdle. At our 2016 pace, and we expect to complete 270 wells this year, that represents 12 years of drilling potential. In addition, we are confident our premium inventory will continue to grow in size and quality. Our proven track record of organic exploration and sustainable gains through technology and efficiency will continue to add premium inventory for years to come. What that means, and this is the most important point, is that between our existing premium inventory and our confidence that we can replace it, EOG will be in premium drilling mode from now on. EOG's shift to premium drilling in 2016 is not just simple high-grading. It is a permanent upgrade for all our future drilling. It's important to realize that this is much more than a small incremental shift in our drilling program. It's a major step change in terms of per well productivity. For the average 2016 well, we estimate a 50% increase in the first 120 days of production per foot of treated lateral versus wells we completed in 2015. Our shift to premium drilling allows EOG to quickly return to triple-digit, and I'll say this again, to quickly return to triple-digit capital rates of return as oil prices improve to modest levels. So the next logical question is what becomes of the remaining inventory? Our non-premium inventory is still very high-quality. By any industry standard, it is Tier 1 quality with tremendous value. Due to the quality, a large percentage of this inventory will be converted to premium through technology and efficiency gains over time. The remaining high-quality inventory will add value to property sales or trades as part of our ongoing upgrading process. Our second objective in 2016 is to protect our balance sheet. Two years in a row we have cut capital by more than 40%, demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline. In addition, as a result of our ongoing evaluation of our portfolio to upgrade our asset base, we are marketing certain valuable but non-core properties. EOG prioritizes profitability and a healthy balance sheet to prepare the company for uncertain commodity cycles, and the strategy has paid off. EOG entered 2016 in excellent financial and operational shape. The combination of EOG's high-quality assets, sustainable cost reductions, and well productivity improvements allow the company to lead the industry in returns year after year. EOG is uniquely positioned with a large and growing inventory of high-return drilling, even in a $40 price environment. Achieving strong returns in the current environment positions EOG to achieve tremendous returns as commodity prices improve. Now I'll turn the call over David Trice, who will update you on the Eagle Ford and Rockies plays. David W. Trice - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Thanks, Bill. Year after year, the Eagle Ford continues to impress us with the quality of its resource potential. In 2015, we grew production while completing 38% fewer wells compared to 2014. Six years ago, we estimated the Eagle Ford had 900 million barrels of oil equivalent of net resource potential. We've since updated that net resource potential three times, and our latest estimate from early 2014 was 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In 2015, we've done a number of things that hold promise for further upside to the Eagle Ford's resource potential. First, refinements to our high-density completion techniques continue to improve well productivity in 2015, as can be seen in the cumulative production charts in our investor presentation on page 10. Second, to complement high-density completions, we've made tremendous progress on what we have termed precision targeting. This is one of the most promising developments, not only for the Eagle Ford, but for all of our plays. Precision targeting starts with first identifying and then mapping the key petrophysical properties that make the difference between a good well and a great well. Once all the data has been integrated, we found that the real sweet spot in any given target can be very narrow. Where we previously landed our wells in 150-foot window, we now precisely steer them in a window as narrow as 20 feet. In addition, this work on precision targeting also revealed that, in some areas, we may have two distinct sweet spot targets in the lower Eagle Ford alone. Finally, we conducted a pilot test by drilling adjacent wells in a W-pattern that alternate between the two targets within the lower Eagle Ford. This allows for surface downspacing closer than the 300 feet used in our current development spacing and resource potential estimates. Early results from these tests are encouraging. In 2016, we have more program flexibility, as 91% of our Eagle Ford acreage is held by production. We plan to complete 150 Eagle Ford wells while continuing to test the W-pattern, spacing wells 200 to 250 feet apart. Our advancements in precision targeting and completions, along with cost efficiencies, may have significant implications on our resource potential. and will allow us to continue to upgrade additional Eagle Ford locations to premium status. In our Rockies and Bakken plays, we proactively scaled back activity due to commodity prices. With the lower activity level, we were able to sharpen our focus on sustainable operational improvements. We are very pleased with the progress. And in fact, the magnitude of operational improvements in these plays were the best in the company. Here are the highlights. First, we upgraded our Bakken net resource potential to 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent and added almost 1,000 net locations. Second, we reduced Bakken completed well cost 18% and drilling days over 30%. Third, we built water handling and water pipeline infrastructure that significantly reduces long-term LOE. Fourth, we drilled several high-quality wells in the Powder River Basin, highlighted by the Flatbow 602-1621H that came online in the fourth quarter. This Turner well averaged over 1,100 barrels of oil per day and 1.7 million cubic feet per day of rich natural gas in its first 90 days of production. Finally, we also drilled an industry record well in the Bakken. The Riverview 102-32H produced an average of 2,700 barrels of oil per day over the first 30 days, and 2,200 barrels of oil per day for the first 90 days of production. This well was the first high-density completion on our Antelope Extension acreage and is an industry record, even though it is only a 4,300-foot lateral. Going forward, we will continue to develop this area at a moderate pace as we build out the infrastructure that will allow us to lower long-term operating costs. We're encouraged by these 2015 accomplishments in the Rockies and Bakken. And while the activity level will remain low in 2016, our focus on operational and well performance improvements will continue. We expect to see additional cost efficiencies and well productivity advancements through completions and targeting refinements. We plan to complete approximately 35 wells in the Rockies in 2016. As we continue progressing technically and reducing costs, we expect the premium location count to grow significantly. Finally, a quick update on our Conwy project in the East Irish Sea; all work for startup has been completed by EOG, and we are working with the platform operator to reach final acceptance, which we believe is imminent. We expect first production by the end of the quarter. Here's Billy Helms to review our activity in the Permian Delaware Basin. Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Thanks, David. Our Permian Delaware Basin team has made tremendous amount of progress last year. Prior to 2015, we developed a successful winter program and had encouraging results with the Wolfcamp and Bone Springs intervals. As we entered 2015, we laid out a specific plan to : one, increase our technical knowledge to better understand the potential of these complex plays; two, improve our operational execution and cost performance; and three, expand the scope and impact of the basin to EOG. Our efforts paid off. Here's a recap of our progress. First, we made tremendous progress utilizing two techniques : precision targeting and high-density completions. Our enhanced understanding of the regional stratigraphy of the basin helps us to delineate the most productive target intervals within each formation. This technique requires a significant amount of technical data and data analysis expertise and, coupled with our high-density completion technique, generates solid improvements in well productivity, as evidenced by our industry record-setting Wolfcamp well. The Thor 21 #702H produced an average of 3,490 barrels of oil equivalent per day over its first 30 days of production. After 120 days, average production was an impressive 2,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Notably, the well was completed with a shorter lateral, yet still exceeded the longer lateral wells in absolute production. In fact, on average, our 2015 Wolfcamp wells produced 40% more than the next best operator during the first three months of production, as displayed on slide nine of our investor presentation. Second, we made significant progress generating sustainable cost reductions. For example, in the Wolfcamp oil window, we reduced average drilling time 33% and lowered completed well cost 35%, despite adding incremental cost to each well for high-density completions. In addition, we secured a long-term brackish water supply that, as we move into 2016, is expected to save us $200,000 to $300,000 per well. And finally, we increased the net resource potential for the Delaware Basin by 1.0 billion barrels of oil equivalent and added 2,200 net locations, essentially adding decades of drilling inventory. This solidifies the position for the Delaware Basin as one of our high-return growth engines. We also executed on another 8,000 net acre acquisition in the fourth quarter, bringing total 2015 Delaware Basin acquisitions to 34,000 net acres. This adds to our sweet spot acreage, with significant upside potential through multiple stack targets. Thanks to the well productivity improvements and cost reductions achieved in 2015, the Delaware Basin delivers returns that compete for capital alongside the Eagle Ford. A large portion of the Delaware Basin is already considered premium. And with our continued advancements, we expect to dramatically increase our inventory of premium locations in the next few years. For 2016, we are continuing the momentum. The Delaware Basin will again be EOG's second most active basin next to the Eagle Ford. We plan to complete the same number of wells as we did in 2015, about 75, and we'll focus primarily on the Wolfcamp. Drilling the Wolfcamp generates excellent returns while allowing us to collect data on the shallower targets at the same time. I'll now address reserve replacement and refining cost. All in, proved reserves decreased 15% in 2015, driven primarily by price-related revisions. Excluding revisions due to commodity price changes, we replaced 192% of our 2015 production at a low finding cost of $11.91 per BOE. For the 28th consecutive year, DeGolyer and MacNaughton performed an independent engineering analysis of our reserves, and their estimate was within 5% of our internal estimate. Their analysis covered about 86% of our proved reserves this year. Please see the schedules accompanying this earnings press release for the calculation of reserve replacement and finding cost. I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure. Timothy K. Driggers - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : Thanks, Billy. I'll begin with a few comments about our capital spending last year and in the fourth quarter. Capitalized interest for the quarter was $8.9 million. For the fourth quarter of 2015, total expiration and development expenditures were $737 million, including facilities of $116 million and excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants, and other property, plant, and equipment were $35 million. There were $105 million of acquisitions during the quarter. For the full year 2015, capitalized interest was $41.8 million. Total exploration and development expenditures were $4.4 billion, including facilities of $765 million and excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants, and other property, plant, and equipment were $288 million. For the full year, capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations were $4.7 billion, $200 million below the low end of our original 2015 guidance. Total cash flow from operations was $3.6 billion. In addition, proceeds from asset sales were $193 million. Total acquisitions for the year were $481 million. At year end, total debt outstanding was $6.7 billion, for a debt to total capitalization ratio of 34%. Taking into account $719 million of cash on hand at year end, net debt to total capital was 31%. In the fourth quarter of 2015, total impairments were $168 million. $94 million of these impairments were the result of significant declines in commodity prices during the fourth quarter. For the full year 2015, total impairments were $6.6 billion. $6.3 billion of these impairments were the results of declines in commodity prices and were related to legacy natural gas assets and marginal liquids plays. The remaining impairments for both the fourth quarter and full year 2015 were ongoing lease and producing property impairments. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29%, and the deferred tax ratio was 92%. Yesterday, we included a guidance table with our earnings press release for the first quarter and full-year 2016. Our 2016 CapEx estimate is $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion excluding acquisitions. The exploration and development portion excluding facilities will account for almost 80% of the total CapEx budget. Our 2016 CapEx estimate represents a 47% decrease from 2015 and is 70% less than 2014 capital expenditures, demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline. The budget for exploration and development facilities and gathering, processing, and other accounts for approximately 20% of the total CapEx budget for 2016. We plan to concentrate our infrastructure spending in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin to support our drilling programs in those areas and enhance operating efficiency. In terms of hedges, for natural gas we have approximately 60,000 MMBtu per day hedged at $2.49 per MMBtu for March 1 through August 1, 2016. We currently have no hedges in place for oil. Now I'll turn it back over to Bill. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Tim. Now for a few comments on the macro, during the fourth quarter of 2014, EOG was early to respond to the price signals in the market. We cut CapEx, scaled back activity, and focused on returns instead of growing oil into an oversupplied market. As we start 2016, we are encouraged by the discipline operators are demonstrating around the world. This disciplined capital reduction is rapidly slowing U.S. oil drilling and reducing significant amounts of future supply worldwide. We believe the pace of market correction is increasing in 2016. Now in summary, I will leave you with a few important points. First, 2015 was a record year for EOG in terms of improving the company. We had record well and operating cost reductions and a record year in improving well productivity. We also had our best year ever in adding new high-quality deep drilling inventory. Second, we are rapidly resetting the company to be successful in a lower commodity price environment. We are focused on improving returns and lowering operating cost instead of growing oil at the bottom of the market. Third, our shift to premium drilling this year should yield strong capital returns in a low commodity price environment. Premium wells generate after-tax rates of return of 30% or better at $40 oil and over 100% after-tax rates return at $60 oil. Therefore, EOG is uniquely positioned for tremendous performance as oil prices improve. Fourth, we do not view premium drilling mode as a temporary bridge to get through low oil prices. With over 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, a premium net resource potential, and 12 years of premium inventory, this is a permanent shift in the quality of EOG's future wells. We believe the company will continue to grow the size and quality of premium inventory for years to come. Fifth, we remain long-term focused. We continue to do the things that will add significant upside to the future of the company, like investments in exploration, secondary recovery, and other new technologies. Our focus is creating long-term shareholder value through sustainable productivity advancements. And finally, our goal has always been to be the low-cost U.S. horizontal oil producer. As we look to the future, that's not enough. Our goal is now squarely set on being one of the lowest-cost producers in the competitive global oil market, and we are well on our way to reaching that goal. Thanks for listening, now we'll go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. My first question is your premium locations appear higher than most peers' core or comparable locations. Can you discuss what you think differentiates EOG's premium locations and what's proprietary and represents a barrier for peers to achieve similar results? And also, if I could, you mentioned upside at locations. Any color on what percentage of the average locations have already been reviewed? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Evan, certainly we believe moving into premium drilling mode is a step change in the future of the company. It's a substantial increase, as we said. Over the last two years, it's about a 95% increase in the quality of the wells we're going to drill and a 50% uplift for this year. So we're moving more rapidly than what maybe we might have even thought a few years ago. What's driving that is the quality of the rock. The quality of the rock is the most important factor in the productivity of the well. So we made extremely strong technical advancements in identifying the best rock in the best plays over the years, and certainly we believe we've captured the premier acreage in the premier plays in the U.S. And then also, in each one of those plays we've developed petrophysical techniques, seismic techniques. We've used a lot of core data and our combined over 10 years' experience in these horizontal plays to identify the best target zones in each one of the plays. And so that is the main driver. It's the rock quality, capturing it first and then being able to take all the technical knowledge and tools that we've developed over the years and to, in our experience, to be able to pick out the best targets. And then we've developed proprietary techniques to not only identify but to place the laterals in those targets and to keep the lateral in those targets for a long portion of the well. So our goal is to keep those targets, those laterals in the best rock about 95% or better on the well. And so that's really the main driver. We think that's a very unique, very proprietary ability of EOG, and will be very difficult to duplicate in the future. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And a follow-up, if I may. You discussed the 55% jump in expected performance per foot in 2016. But since your DUCs are completed on largely a FIFO basis, I presume that many of the wells you complete this year are 2015 vintage. So my question is, is that right? And would that then mean there's another step change in performance for 2017 as you complete and turn more of those newly identified premium locations, all other things being equal? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Evan, a large percentage of our wells that we're going to complete in the first half of the year are carryover DUCs from 2015. The majority of those wells are very beneficial to what we've been learning about targeting and identifying the rock. So those will be fantastic wells, and we'll get extremely strong returns on those. But the learning curve is not over. We continue to refine our knowledge and our ability to execute. And so, we see this as really just the beginning of a continuing, we believe, sustainable productivity increase in our drilling going forward. As we said in the opening, we've identified 3,200 locations and over 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent so far that's premium, and we expect that to grow over time, in numbers and quality. So this is really a big game-changer for the company. We think it's very proprietary, and so we think it's going to give us an extremely competitive edge going forward. So we believe, as oil prices improve, we will be able to rapidly be able to generate triple-digit rates of return going forward. So this is a very meaningful step for the company. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I appreciate that. Operator : Next will be Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Doug. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Bill, the production range for the year is obviously pretty wide. I guess what I'm trying understand is, there's a fairly large proportion of DUCs, I'm guessing. I would have thought that would have given greater certainty to the outcome, so I'm just wondering if you can help us reconcile the \u2013 are you being relatively conservative with the range that you're giving us, or is it something else? And I've got a follow-up, please. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Doug, I'm going to ask Gary Thomas to give you some color on that. Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer : Doug, I didn't get completely your question here. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So what I'm getting at is, I would have thought, if you're completing wells you've already drilled but haven't completed, it would have given greater certainty to the outcome and the production outlook for the year. But the range for the year is still very, very wide. I'm just trying to reconcile those two things. Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer : Okay. On the DUCs, yes, as Bill mentioned, we're going to be completing quite a number, about 70 of our DUCs. We're going to be completing additional DUCs than that. We're going to be completing at least 100 first quarter wells that we drill as DUCs. And those DUCs are all premium. They generate a 30% rate of return at $40 oil. And our guidance is very similar to what we've had in previous years. We're saying anywhere from 260,000 to 280,000 barrels of oil per day for 2016. That pretty well duplicates what we had in 2015. Does that answer your question? Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, well I guess I was talking about BOE guidance, which is still quite wide, but I'll take it offline with Cedric [Burgher]. My follow-up is really more balance sheet related. So I think in the past, though in a more robust oil price environment, you talked about a 30% ceiling on your net debt-to-cap. You're slightly above that right now. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that. And this is not in any way disparaging to the industry, but a lot of very strong companies with very strong balance sheets have taken advantage of their relative outperformance by, obviously, issuing equity. I'm just curious as to how you feel about the uncertainty of the outlook and how you might balance the priorities to reinforce the strength of your balance sheet, given how well your stock has done relative to the market? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Doug, first of all, EOG has no current plans to issue equity at this time. Certainly we entered the year, we came into the downturn with a strong balance sheet, and we've been disciplined throughout the process. And so, when we look, as we go forward for this year, we have tremendous flexibility to make further adjustments to capital throughout the year. We do anticipate selling non-core properties, as we consistently do every year. We're pretty far along in that process. We have what we believe are very high-quality, strong buyers for properties. And this could be \u2013 this is not a small amount of money; it's very significant. So we're quite confident in that process. And so our goal going forward is to maintain a strong balance sheet. And fortunately, our balance sheet right now is one of the strongest in the peer group. So, that's certainly a focus for us. It's certainly been a hallmark. A strong balance sheet has been a hallmark for EOG for years, and we've not taken our sight off that. And we're going to be committed to maintaining a good strong balance sheet going forward. Operator : The next question is from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Bill, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the premium drilling inventory. You guys cited, I believe, 3,200 premium locations and 2 billion barrels, I believe, of gross recovery. That would equate to an EUR of 625 MBoe, if you just average that out. About half of that premium inventory is in the Eagle Ford. So I guess my question is, your overall Eagle Ford guidance is for 450 MBoe recovery, and that's after royalties. So I was wondering if you could just maybe comment on the differences in the premium inventory in the Eagle Ford relative to that 450 MBoe average? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The first thing, the 2 billion barrels is net. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's net? Okay. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, that's net. So the gross EUR per well would be quite bigger than what you stated. And let me let David Trice comment a little bit more on the details on the Eagle Ford and what we expect there going forward. David W. Trice - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Arun, in the Eagle Ford, like we stated in our remarks, we've done a lot of work there. Obviously, over the years, we've collected a tremendous amount of data. Even this last year in 2015, we drilled quite a few pilot holes where we actually drilled down through the Eagle Ford and collected a lot of data. And so what that allowed us to see was that we have a lot of additional upside there as far as working on the targeting. Like I had mentioned, we're drilling 20-foot target intervals and doing multiple targets within the lower Eagle Ford. We're seeing very good results with that, and we're quite encouraged. So I think really going forward, we see a real opportunity to continue to add premium locations. We stated in our slides that we've got approximately 1,500 premium locations in the Eagle Ford, but we certainly see that as a starting point as far as being able to continue to add premium locations. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Let me just add, to answer your question specifically on the 450 net MBoe per well in the Eagle Ford. That is for an average Eagle Ford well, and that is not a premium well. Premium wells would be quite a bit better than that. And then that number is stale. So we haven't updated that 450 net MBoe per well for several years, and we've made quite a bit of advancements since then in the high-density frac technology, and now we're making advancements in targeting also. So those numbers, it takes a little bit of time to get confirmation on what the new EUR number is. So when you make these advancements, you want to make sure you get at least a year of production, and then you can adjust them up accordingly. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you, Bill. And my follow-up, Bill, in some cases you now stratified the inventory a little bit between premium and other locations. You mentioned in your prepared remarks about EOG potentially being open to upgrading or trading inventory, and I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate on that for the non-premium inventory. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The non-premium inventory will have two avenues. The first avenue will be that we believe the majority of it will be converted to premium over time as we continue to learn how to target the rock more correctly and we continue to be able to be better at picking out the high-quality rock in the target zone. So it's an ongoing process in every one of these plays, and we expect continued improvement. If it doesn't make it to the premium inventory level and it never gets in our CapEx, then certainly it has a lot of value. All this non-premium inventory that we have, if you compared it to the rest of the industry, it would be Tier 1 inventory. It's very high quality. So that gives us a chance to market this as we go forward down the road through property sales, as we normally do in our asset upgrading process. Hello? Operator : And we'll go next to Brian Singer. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you, good morning. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Bill, in your opening comments, you mentioned a focus, more specific focus of EOG being a competitive low-cost producer in the global market, not just U.S. shale. Before we run with this too far, do you still expect to do this predominantly through U.S. shale, or is this any signal you're willing to pursue international shale or global non-shale investment opportunities to a greater degree? And is it still your view that you can do this from the premium focus areas that you talked to and then that you have in the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, and Bakken? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Brian, we have no intention of expanding international efforts, so we are going to be very much U.S. driven. We see tremendous opportunity in the U.S. And so this whole direction towards being not only the low-cost producer in the U.S. horizontal, we think we're clearly there. And our sight now is really set on being one of the lowest-cost producers in the world market. And we believe that we can accomplish this with our very high-quality assets that we currently have and continuing to improve them and continuing to come up with new technology as we go forward. And we also believe very strongly that we can continue to grow that quality asset much faster than we're drilling it. And that would be through converting existing inventory in the premium and also through new plays. So we see tremendous opportunity the U.S., and we're going to stay focused there. And we're quite confident that we can continue to lower our operating cost, lower our well cost, and improve well productivity to become more than competitive in the world. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it, thanks. And then on the follow-up side, I've got two little questions. One, you highlighted exploration here, and I wondered if you could just give an update on whether you expect to bring any meaningful projects to the finish line and ultimately announce that in 2016, or whether the reduced budget is prohibitive in that regard. And then on the asset sale front, have you worked any production impact from potential asset sales into the guidance that you've provided? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : For the latter part of your question, we've not put any asset sales volumes into the production guidance. And so the first part of it \u2013 what was the first part of the question? Timothy K. Driggers - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : Exploration. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, exploration. We did not want to take any short-term cuts that might affect the long-term benefit of the company this year. So we left in a considerable amount of money in the current budget for exploration, both in acreage, buying acreage on emerging plays. And we'll also have several tests of new plays continuing this year. So we'll see how all those go. We're quite hopeful and quite optimistic that we have maybe some plays that will be premium plays. We won't move them forward unless they would be premium, of course, but we're quite optimistic on the exploration front. Operator : And your next question is from Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company. Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is what commodity price assumptions are embedded in your 2016 capital plan? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Pearce, we use the strip, and we used the strip that was in the first part of January. And so we haven't got any \u2013 we don't really put in a lot of upside to the current prices. I think it was based on prices around $40 was the current strip we used. Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International : Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then my follow-up, this is a hard question to ask, so just bear with me, but it follows up on Brian Singer's question. On the exploration front, for the past number of years you guys have worked on various plays. And obviously you've had tremendous success, with the Eagle Ford as an example. But now those plays weren't really \u2013 some of those plays weren't economic or couldn't compete with your really core plays back when oil was $80 to $100. And now obviously oil is a lot lower. And I know service costs have come down. But when you look at those plays and you also look at what you mentioned in the press release about this premium inventory and how much success you're having at improving your existing inventory, would it make sense instead of spending the money on exploration on trying to discover new plays to actually use that money to buy existing acreage around the core around plays, whether it be the Eagle Ford, the Permian, the Bakken, SCOOP/STACK, or whatnot, and then take your core competency and expertise, which is clearly in making something better? Would it be a better use of the capital and generate a higher return for shareholders? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Pearce, let me let Billy Helms comment on that. We're very focused both on tactical acquisitions. I'll let him give you some color on that. Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Good morning, Pearce. What we were able to accomplish last year is a good example of that. We focus in first \u2013 the first effort is understanding where the premium acreage is that Bill described earlier. It gets down to basically understanding the rock. And we have to understand where that rock exists. And then those pieces that are added to our portfolio that compete for capital in our existing portfolio certainly will add to that, as we exhibited last year in our Delaware Basin acquisitions. And we'll continue that effort as we go into the next year. That's just part of our ongoing philosophy of how we continue to grow the company. And we balance that off with, as you know, we also manage to sell off properties every year. And so we balance those two with the overall capital discipline we have in the company. So that's always been part of our strategy and will continue to be. Operator : And the next call is from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Paul. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : I was wondering if your drilling contracts are committing you to more drilling than you would otherwise do, all things being equal. It just feels as if you're somewhat dependent now on the oil price recovering. But more importantly, I was wondering whether if you didn't have those locked-in drilling contracts, you would actually be completing more wells and drilling less. Thanks. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Paul, we did enter the year with 13 rigs under contract. I think the average this year will be 11 rigs. We looked very hard at trying to buy out those contracts to reduce that, since we do have so many DUCs in place. But when we ran the numbers, it just didn't make economic sense. Those rigs are the best quality rigs in the business. The efficiency is tremendous, and it just didn't make economic sense to buy those out. And so we're really focused on going forward. We didn't want to grow oil, obviously, this year in the low part of the cycle, and so we didn't want to accelerate the DUCs. And so I'm going to let Gary Thomas give you a little bit more detail on the rig situation and our DUC situation. Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer : Yes, Paul, this is Gary. And if we didn't have these rigs under contract, we would certainly be completing more of our DUCs, with them all being premium wells, but we're just honoring those contracts. And as Bill said, yes, we're going to average \u2013 we were at 27 rigs under contract in 2015. It's 11 rigs this year, and we average 5.5 rigs next year. So yes, in 2017 we'll be able to certainly accelerate the completion of our DUCs, which will be very beneficial to us. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : And the follow-up would just be I assume at these prices CapEx would be lower but for the contracts. Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer : That's right, yes. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : And you would be simply neither completing nor drilling as much if it wasn't for the fact that you're committed and it would be too expensive to buy the contracts out. Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer : That's correct. Yes, sir. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you, that clarifies it. Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer : That's more flexibility. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it, understood. Thank you. Operator : Next is Biju Perincheril with Susquehanna Brokers. Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Bill, I had a question about the high-density completions. It almost sounds like when I look at it, you're taking the unconventional rust warren (52:33) and transforming it into something close to a conventional rust warren (52:36) near the wellbore. And I don't expect it's a fair way to characterize it, but I guess my question is do you think there are any implications for the longer-term shape of the decline curve of these new completions? I'm thinking several years out. I would like to hear your take on it. Thanks. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The high-density completions, what they do, you described it fairly accurately, is that they contact enormous amounts of surface area of the rock, and they hit it very, very, very close to the well bore. So obviously, the better the rock and the more that you connect to the well bore, especially close to the well bore, has the tremendous effect on the uplift of wells. And I'm going to let Billy Helms comment on the long-term effect of this uplift. Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Biju, you did characterize it fairly accurately. I think the one way to think about is, certainly the more rocky contact in the reservoir, basically yes, you're going to increase the initial potential of that well. But by contacting more of that rock, you're also increasing the ultimate recovery from every well. So you will see good initial production rates. But your decline, we're seeing the benefit of declines flattening, with more production from these high-density completions. So the overall effect has been quite uplifting. Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : So when we compare the shape of the decline curve in the longer term, do you think it will remain fairly similar? So, when we look at the terminal rates, would you expect a higher decline for the higher-density completions, or no? Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: No, no. Actually, we're not seeing that at all. We're seeing, longer term, the wells will produce longer, and the initial decline is little bit less steep than the older completions are, just simply because you're connecting a lot more rock to the well bore. Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Perfect, thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from David Tameron with Wells Fargo Securities. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Bill, how do you think about a ramp as you go into \u2013 assuming we get some upward pressure on prices a year from now, how quickly can you ramp? I know you talked about prior \u2013 the availability of people, maybe the services industry can't respond as fast. Can you just walk us through how you would see a scenario, if oil goes back to $55 tomorrow, like how does that play out for EOG? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : David, we're set up tremendously well. Of course, we're going to have a very large, very high-quality DUC inventory. We have rigs in place, and we have a substantial amount of frac spreads running. We delayed the work schedule on some of the frac spreads to maybe five days a week instead of seven days a week type scenarios, so that we could keep a number of frac spreads in place that would be easy to accelerate. When the oil prices begin to recover, we're going to be disciplined going forward. We don't \u2013 obviously don't want to be fooled again, like the industry was fooled last year by a little bit of an uptick in oil price and it is not sustainable. So, we're going to be disciplined and cautious going forward on ramping up capital until we're very much convinced that this is not a short-term uptick in the price, and that the market is more in balance, and that the price is more sustainable. But we think, obviously, EOG is in a fantastic shape to generate extremely strong \u2013 we're talking about triple-digit rates of return \u2013 as oil prices improve, and we have ability to grow oil when the time comes. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then, if I think about it, I've asked a couple others the same question. But if I think about \u2013 if you make the decision tomorrow to add rigs, and obviously, with the DUCs, you can cover some of this gap. But how long \u2013 you say tomorrow, you say, let's add a rig. How long does it take before we see that production, given the laterals and pads and everything else? Is that a six month before you start to see that production in the numbers? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : David, I'm going to ask Gary Thomas to give some color on that. Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer : David, the benefit to EOG is having these. By end of year, we'll have 230 of these DUCs to complete. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yes. Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer : And with having those, and then having the number of frac fleets that we have currently that we could ramp up, as Bill was saying, besides being able to add, when you just start with the completion and bringing on, you can see a pretty substantial increase in volumes within three to four months. Now when you would just be starting grassroots with drilling rigs, it would be almost twice that long, like you're mentioning, the six months. It would be about half that time. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. No, that's helpful. Thanks for all the color. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Scialla with Stifel. Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Maybe a follow-up to David's question, it sounded like you're not inclined to want to go back to growth mode unless you see a significant price increase. But looking at that inventory of 3,200 premium locations that generate a 30%-plus IRR with $40 oil, if it looks like that's all that we're going to get out of a recovery, would you go back to a growth mode, if that were the case? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think, Mike, that would give \u2013 $40 oil would give us obviously a bit more cash flow, but we would be certainly wanting to stay balanced, discretionary cash flow to CapEx. So that's really going to control the amount of growth that we have, and along with making sure that the oil price is really sustainable. So we can generate the returns, but the growth of the company will be regulated by, obviously, the number of wells we complete and the continued improvement we have, but it would be regulated by the cash flow of the company. Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then can you talk about in terms of that premium count, you said, Bill, that you could grow that over time. You alluded to how you would do that with better targeting. But I wanted to see where you anticipate if you can say where most of that will come from. Is it downspacing in the Eagle Ford? Is it primarily from the Permian or somewhere else? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Mike, it will be from really multiple sources. We're learning in every one of the plays that we're in, and it's really just being able to identify those target windows within those good plays and then executing on those. So we were still working on downspacing in every one of the plays. So it will come from multiple plays, improving the inventory there to premium, and then it will come from new plays too. We have quite a bit of confidence that through our learning process on existing plays that we can identify very high-quality rock in emerging plays, and so we're actively engaged in buying acreage and testing wells in those too. So it will come from a multiple source. Historically, even though the uptick when we had $90 \u2013 $95 oil and we were growing very quickly and drilling a lot of wells, we were able to add twice as many wells each year than what we actually drilled. And so we're very confident that we can continue that kind of multiple on the premium going forward. Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, thank you. Operator : And the next question is from Subash Chandra with Guggenheim. Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good morning. Are we looking at a permanent shift to better wells but fewer wells, and how exacting your premium process is and how reliant it is on massive data analysis? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Certainly, when you're drilling twice as good a well, you don't have to drill nearly as many of them. And so that certainly helps keep your CapEx down and you're able to have a lot more efficiency there. So as we go forward, the learning process will be incremental in each one of these plays, and it's just an ongoing theme. We learn this and then we try it. And as we get good positive results, we're able to apply that to additional wells. And then the sustainable technology gains that we have in the company have been very, very continuous and very steady over the whole life of our involvement in horizontal drilling. It's over 10 years of experience, combined knowledge, and we have quite an innovative culture in the company. And we expect that to continue to improve the wells as we go forward. Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC : And the follow-up is, and no question, you're light years ahead in many ways. When we think about the additional inventory in that it's dependent on data that where you have more wells is likely where we'll see more inventory over time? And so the other side of that is how applicable is this to new exploration concepts? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Correctly, when we have an ongoing drilling program and we're collecting data all the time in an existing play, that's certainly how you make advances. But we also are able to take that learning experience and apply it to new plays. So the high-density frac techniques, the kinds of rocks that would respond to high-density techniques, and then the petrophysical properties of rocks in emerging plays and then the core work where we do an extensive amount of very detailed core work, and we integrate all this data along with 3-D seismic. And so all that goes into bear on defining new plays with high-quality rock. And so it's a learning process that spills over, and it really helps us keep the momentum and to keep adding premium inventory as we go forward. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Thomas, at this time I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : EOG has got a strong track record of game-changing events that have made the company successful over time. Our shift to premium drilling mode this year with an estimated 50% year-over-year increase in well productivity is another step-change to the company's performance. Premium drilling allows EOG to generate solid capital returns at $40 oil, and quite frankly spectacular returns if oil prices recover. With our focus on improving returns instead of production growth during this down cycle, EOG is now positioned for tremendous performance as prices improve. We believe the best times for the company are ahead of us. So thank you for listening and thank you for your support. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.",

Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the EOG Resources 2016 first quarter results conference call. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir. Timothy K. Driggers - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : Thank you, good morning, and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing first quarter 2016 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the press release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website. Participating on the call this morning are : Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Gary Thomas, President and Chief Operating Officer; Billy Helms, EVP, Exploration and Production; David Trice, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, VP, Marketing Operations; and Cedric Burgher, Senior VP, Investor and Public Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening, and we included guidance for the second quarter and full-year 2016 in yesterday's press release. This morning we'll discuss topics in the following order. Bill Thomas will review our 2016 plan and first quarter highlights. Billy Helms and David Trice will review the operational results. I will then discuss EOG's financials, capital structure, and hedge position. And Bill will provide concluding remarks. Here's Bill Thomas. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. EOG is becoming an even better company that was just a year ago about lowering development and production costs and increasing returns. In yesterday's press release, we announced two exciting developments that have the potential to be significant additional drivers of higher returns and lower costs. I'll briefly highlight those, and Billy and David will provide details in a moment. Finally, I'll review our shift to premium drilling and how this shift is a game-changing event with significant long-term implications for EOG shareholders. First, I want to highlight EOG's development of the first successful enhanced oil recovery [EOR] technology in U.S. horizontal shale. We initiated our EOR efforts in the Eagle Ford three years ago. Here's what we've learned since that time. Number one, geology matters. The Eagle Ford is unique. The same geologic characteristics that make the Eagle Ford prolific in primary development also make it unique for enhanced oil recovery. The EOR process we are using to produce incremental oil out of the Eagle Ford is not necessarily applicable to other horizontal basins. Number two, how you initially drill the field matters. Secondary recovery works best on leased units that were developed using the best completions with optimal spacing. Finally, returns matter. We figured out how to execute EOR economically. The process can be implemented at rates of return that rival our premium drilling and significantly lower finding costs over time. The second item I'll highlight is our discovery in the South Texas Austin Chalk. The term \"discovery\" is loaded, as many operators have been drilling the Chalk for years with varying degrees of success. Perhaps a more accurate characterization is that we discovered a new geologic concept in an existing play. Our team at EOG has cracked the code on how to make our particular footprint in the Austin Chalk a top-tier horizontal play, earning returns on par with the Eagle Ford, Permian, and Bakken. The third item I would like to review is EOG's shift to premium drilling this year. The shift is a game-changer with significant long-term implications. I will cover those implications in a moment. But first, let's review what we mean by premium. Premium inventory is defined as drilling locations that generate at least 30% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil. Here are a few more clarifying points regarding this inventory. First, 30% return is not an average; it's a minimum. Second, 30% was established as the minimum direct return to ensure that when indirect costs are included, the drilling program earns healthy full-cycle returns. Third, we fully expect to more than replace our drilling inventory with new premium locations every year. Therefore, and this is the most important point. Our shift to premium is permanent and not simply a temporary high-grading process in a low commodity price environment. So early 2016 will mark the point in time that EOG made a significant permanent shift in its drilling program. There are many long-term implications for that shift. The first is superior capital discipline. Premium drilling sets a new higher standard for capital allocation within the company. The second is a large capital efficiency gain. We do not need 50 rigs drilling thousands of wells per year. It will take far less capital to grow production at strong double-digit rates. The third implication is we can return to triple-digit direct rates of return with oil as low as $60 per barrel. And if history is any indication, we will continue to push the oil price needed for triple-digit returns even lower. And finally, premium drill extends our lead as the low-cost horizontal oil producer. As I outlined, our permanent shift to premium drilling this year is a game-changing event for EOG. Yesterday's announcement regarding our enhanced oil recovery success in the Eagle Ford and our Austin Chalk drilling success are two more technical and operational achievements that help us reach our long-term goal of being one of the lowest-cost producers in the global oil market. Now I'll turn it over to Billy Helms to discuss our exciting results from enhanced oil recovery in the Eagle Ford. Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Thanks, Bill. Three years ago we initiated an effort to test EOR using gas injection in horizontal shale. The results from lab experiments indicated that the process was technically feasible, but the economics and operational execution were going to be challenged without some creative problem solving. Our EOR team has not only solved the problem, but demonstrated returns that are competitive with our premium drilling program. That EOR process we developed is highly proprietary, and this limits the amount of detail we are able to disclose. However, I will share several reasons why EOG is uniquely positioned to achieve a successful outcome. As Bill mentioned earlier, the geological setting is important. We have long discussed the competent barriers that encase the Eagle Ford and provide vertical containment for completions. This unique feature also plays a significant role in keeping the injection in contact with the targeted reservoir. The injected gas is thus able to become miscible with the oil in the reservoir and subsequently drive incremental oil recovery. EOG's acreage position is situated in the optimal thermal maturity of the play to maximize oil recovery. Being in the oil window has provided many benefits during the primary development, but it's also important for the EOR process. Acreage that is too far downdip or updip in the play may not benefit as greatly. The EOR economics are significantly enhanced by the scale of EOG's footprint in the play. The infrastructure and facilities that are utilized during primary development across the field are key to being able to operationally execute the EOR process, thus providing a significant economic benefit. These reasons are the keys to the process's success and are why that we believe EOR will not be a blanket application across the Eagle Ford or necessarily applicable to other horizontal shale plays. We have not yet determined how much of EOG's acreage will benefit from EOR or what the overall resource potential may be. The four pilot projects have tested different geographic and geologic settings, each proving the concept successful. But further definition and time will be needed to assess the applicability and overall benefit across EOG's acreage position. Here are some of the key takeaways regarding the economics and recovery potential. One, this EOR technique is not capital intensive. There is no incremental drilling required, so capital costs average approximately $1 million per well. Two, the operating costs are low. The process makes use of produced gas readily available to the field, and there are few other incremental operating costs. Three, EOR may have significant effect on our long-term Eagle Ford base production profile. Unlike typical secondary recovery projects, the production response occurs quickly, within the first two to three months, and holds steady for longer. Four, the combination of lower operating costs and steady production delivers a return profile that complements our primary drilling program. Primary drilling delivers high returns and short paybacks. Our EOR pilots have a much different profile, characterized by modest upfront capital investment that delivers a long annuity of incremental oil production and strong cash flow. The rate of return is still on par with primary drilling. But for each dollar invested, EOR delivers at least twice the net present value created as primary drilling. Finally, our models indicate that this process will increase recovery by 30% to 70%. I want to emphasize. These are incremental potential reserves, not accelerated production, delivered at potential finding costs of $6.00 per barrel or below or less. We will conduct a fifth pilot in 2016, and we will evaluate the results and review our acreage. We will determine the long-term capital production and earnings effect of EOR. It's important to note that while this is a significant technical and economic breakthrough, rolling out this effort will take time and is dependent on the pace of primary development drilling and field development. Now here's David Trice. David W. Trice - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Thanks, Billy. Another exciting development on our South Texas acreage position concerns the Austin Chalk. In our press release yesterday, we published the results of two tremendous Austin Chalk wells. The Leonard AC Unit 101H produced an average of 2,715 barrels of oil equivalent per day for 30 days. The Denali Unit 101H was completed in April, and its average production for the first 20 days was 3,130 barrels of oil equivalent per day. While the Austin Chalk is not a new play, historically industry production has been inconsistent from well to well. While good wells are possible, the performance and resulting returns are highly variable across the play. However, using proprietary petrophysical analysis, we discovered how to apply new geologic concepts to the Austin Chalk and drill prolific wells consistently. Much like the Eagle Ford, the Chalk responds very well to EOG-style completions. Our high-density completions create complex fracture systems close to the well bore, significantly improving well performance. Also like the Eagle Ford, the Austin Chalk benefits from the detailed work we conduct to determine the best target. The chalk can be as thick as 140 feet in some areas, but our targeting efforts keep the drill bit confined to the best 20 to 30 feet of rock. Precision targeting combined with EOG-style completions is now generating prolific premium level well performance. It's too early in our exploration efforts to know how much of the Austin Chalk is prospective over our acreage, but subsurface data and detailed mapping throughout the field are encouraging. We plan to drill seven additional Austin Chalk wells in 2016 and look forward to updating you with future drilling results as we learn more. In the Permian Delaware Basin, our recent activity has focused on the Wolfcamp oil window. Drilling the Wolfcamp generates excellent returns while allowing us to collect data on the shallower targets, such as the Second Bone Spring sand. During the first quarter, we completed a dozen wells, with per well average 30-day rates over 2,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with approximately 70% oil cut. The average lateral of these Wolfcamp wells is approximately 4,500 feet. Over the last year we've focused on increasing our understanding of the geology and maximizing well performance through better technology, such as precision targeting, high-density completions, and better well bore design. As a result, our wells are industry-leading, as illustrated on slide eight in our investor presentation. Since January of last year, our wells have been twice as good as the industry average in the Midland or Delaware Basin when normalized for lateral length. This is the approach EOG takes across all of our plays. We seek to first, understand the geology; second, optimize the completions; and finally, enhance operational practices that maximize efficiencies and lower cost. Our next step for Wolfcamp optimization is to extend the lateral. The breakthroughs we made in well bore design will allow us to apply EOG-style high-density completions to long Wolfcamp laterals. Longer laterals will enhance the economics of our highly successful Wolfcamp program and reduce our surface footprint across the play. In April we drilled two 7,000-foot laterals, the Rattlesnake 21 Fed Com 701H and 702H. These wells are too new to report a 30-day rate. However, the first 20 days of production are averaging more than 3,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well with maximum 24-hour rates of 4,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well. Meanwhile, we continue to further improve operational efficiencies and costs in the Wolfcamp. During the first quarter, drilling days decreased 14% from our 2015 average to 16.1 days. Also, total well costs decreased 8% to $6.9 million, more than offsetting costs associated with continued completion enhancements. In addition, in the second quarter we'll begin using our brackish water supply for our New Mexico completions, with an anticipated saving of $150,000 per well. This new water supply along with many other operational improvements will allow EOG to continue to lower cost and increase returns. On the international front, we are very happy to report that our East Irish Sea Conwy project achieved first production in late March. We are currently addressing normal startup items, and running tests to determine the optimal production rate. Our full-year guidance has been adjusted until we complete more testing. Here's Tim Driggers. Timothy K. Driggers - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : Thanks, David. Capitalized interest for the first quarter 2016 was $9 million. Total exploration and development expenditures were $568 million, excluding property acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants, and other property, plant, and equipment were $25 million. As compared to the first quarter 2015, total exploration expenditures decreased by 62%, while our total production volumes decreased by just 7%. We have maintained our full-year capital expenditure guidance of $2.4 million to $2.6 million (sic) [$2.4 billion to $2.6 billion]. At the end of March 2016, total debt outstanding was $7 billion, and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 36%. At March 31, we had $700 million of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $6.3 billion, for a net debt to total cap ratio of 34%. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 34%, and the deferred tax ratio was 82%. For the period May 1 through June 30, 2016, EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 128,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of $42.56 per barrel. For the period June 1 through August 31, 2016, EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 60,000 MMBtu per day at a weighted average price of $2.49 per MMBtu. Now I'll turn it back over to Bill. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Tim. First, a brief word on our macro views and how they relate to EOG's plans. The substantial reduction in capital investment by the industry in 2015 and 2016 is causing oil supply to decline in many producing regions around the world. Led by steady declines in the U.S. and supported by strong gasoline demand, the market continues to rebalance. We agree with consensus that this process will accelerate in the second half of this year and into 2017. We believe that in the U.S., it will take a sustained $60 to $65 oil price and 12 months of lead time for the industry to deliver a modest level of growth. However, what is true for the industry in general does not hold for EOG. EOG is the low-cost U.S. horizontal oil producer. With our premium drilling inventory, we believe our reinvestment advantage is $15 to $20 per barrel lower than the average industry operator. When the market balances and prices recover to moderate levels, our leading asset quality, best-in-class technology, and low cost structure will become apparent with how quickly we can resume high-return oil growth. And that may be the number one question we received the last two months, or more accurately, at what price will you accelerate and return to growth? Our first priority this year is to completely fund our capital program with cash flow and reduce net debt with property sales. We're in the late stages of negotiating on a number of deals and are confident we will be successful on many this year. We expect their collective impact will be meaningful. Our second priority will be to complete DUCs. We have managed our operations such that we have the capacity to add 40% more completions without adding any additional equipment from the service industry. We can respond quickly as supply and demand balance and oil prices firm. In summary, I would like to leave you with the following important takeaways from this call. Number one, our shift to premium drilling this year is a game-changer. We expect well productivity to improve more than 50% in 2016, which is the largest one-year improvement in the history of the company. More importantly, this shift is permanent. Premium drilling will allow us to maintain a balanced capital program and resume high-return oil growth in a moderate oil price environment. Number two, our enhanced oil recovery success is another example of EOG's ability to make significant technology gains. EUR has the potential to add meaningful long-term value to our Eagle Ford asset by adding low-decline, low-cost, high-return reserves. Number three, the new Austin Chalk results are encouraging for our South Texas acreage position. Time will tell, but we believe the chalk geology we discovered is substantially better and more repeatable than previous chalk drilling. Number four, last year we said 2015 was a record year for improving the company. As we start this year, we are beginning to realize that improvements in 2016 may be even stronger than 2015. Our sustainable gains in technology and efficiencies are running at record-setting pace. And we are excited about what we can achieve in cost reduction and productivity improvements in 2016. Number five, our goal has always been to be the highest return E&P company in the U.S., and we believe we have achieved that goal. Our sights are now set on becoming one of the lowest cost producers in the global oil market. We believe it's possible, and we are moving toward that target rapidly. Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning, guys, and thanks for all the comments. The new EOR results are very encouraging. I know the next step is the 32-well pilot. But once that's complete, what are the remaining gating items to full-scale development, or when do you expect to better understand the extent of the opportunity across the play? Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Evan, this is Billy Helms. So as you mentioned there, the next step obviously is implementing the 32-well pilot. We're still learning a great deal about the process and what its overall impact will be. And primarily the pace of development in the future will depend on our pace of development primarily for the developing out the remaining leases and then how we roll that out. I would say that our pace of rollout, we expect to continue to announce new wells or bring new wells into that process in the coming years. And it will become a part of our overall capital allocation to the Eagle Ford that we do primarily each year, and we'll roll out certainly our 2017 guidance on that probably in February. But we are very encouraged with our initial results. So it's probably a little bit too early to talk about how we're going to roll that out. We still have a lot to learn from our 32-well pilot. And then we still have a lot of leases to develop too. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Does the existence of the EOR potential later in life opportunity, does it change the way you allocate capital on primary drilling, meaning does it make the Eagle Ford either relatively more attractive or the black window versus the condensate window more attractive given this new secondary recovery option? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Evan, this is Bill. I don't think it changes it dramatically. We're focused on premium drilling in all of our plays. And the Eagle Ford, that's what we want to develop first in our leases and that's what we're going to focus on really permanently from now on. So we'll develop those at a normal pace. As Billy mentioned, the key is really to get those developed with the drilling and the completions in the most optimal spacing and to connect as much rock through the primary process and that really enhances the EOR effectiveness as we go forward. So we'll move along both of them at a nice steady pace, and we'll just continue to learn as we go forward. And I think the EOR process will be much like the drilling program. We'll get more efficient as we move forward and we'll be able to lower costs, and it will just become a normal part of our investment in the Eagle Ford. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, guys. I'll leave it there. Thank you. Operator : And we'll move forward to our next caller, Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. Bill, on the EOR process, you've done four pilots and tested it on 15 producing wells. Were the tests successful on all the wells, or could you just talk a little bit about the effectiveness that you've seen thus far? Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Arun, this is Billy Helms. Certainly, in each one of our tests we've learned a lot. I would say without hesitation that all of our pilot tests were successful. Certainly we continue to learn from each one. We started the project really with some laboratory experiments on just trying to understand what the fluid behaviors would be, and that certainly was very encouraging. Then we rolled it out to a single-well pilot and had positive results from that. And then we started applying it to more multi-well pilots. We had two four-well pilots and a six-well pilot, and each one of those was successful. So the next step, as we discussed, is to roll it out on more of a field-scale model, which is this 32-well pilot, and we'll certainly continue to learn from that. But yes, each one was very successful. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for that. Then just my follow-up, Bill, in your prepared remarks when you're talking about the premium locations, you express confidence that you could replace these premium locations from an inventory perspective on an ongoing basis. Can you just give us a little bit more color around what's driving that confidence? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, Arun. As you know, we believe we have very sustainable cost reduction and technology gains. We've done it every year we've been in the business, and we have a lot of confidence and we see a lot of upside going forward to continue that process. So as we increase productivity through being able to identify bedrock and precision targeting and get even better with our high-density frac techniques, we believe that the well productivity will continue to increase. That would be one way to convert. And then we also believe that we have sustainable cost reductions. So two-thirds of our cost reductions during the downturn have been through technology and efficiency gains, and we do not see any end in that. So we're quite confident that efficiency and technology will continue to drive those costs down. And so we believe a large percentage of the inventory that we have in the Eagle Ford will be converted to premium. We also believe that in the Permian, and we believe we'll add continued premium in the Bakken and other plays too. So we're very confident that our premium inventory will grow much faster than our drilling pace. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : We'll move forward to our next question from Scott Hanold with Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Thanks, another question on the EOR process. And I know a lot of the stuff that you all did was proprietary. But when do you think it's the right time to actually put this application to work? So what I'm getting at is obviously these wells have a pretty steep decline rate in the first few years. But generally speaking, is it something that happens more typically earlier in the life compared to say, what occurs in conventional reservoirs when you apply a similar application? Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Yeah. Scott, this is Billy Helms. Typically, the governing part will mainly be \u2013 in actual field applications will be on how we develop each pattern. So as Bill mentioned earlier, the primary goal will be to go through and do a full-scale development on each and every lease with the latest high-density completions. That's the number one goal. And the pace of development from that will dictate as to when we roll out the secondary or the EOR process. But typically \u2013 I think we have a slide in the deck on I think slide four that shows that timeframe will be somewhere in the first two to five years. So I think that would probably be our initial guide. There's really no detriment that we see as to if you wait too long to implement it, it's going to be detrimental. We think it's a great tool for just continuing to contact the remaining oil left in the reservoir. Certainly, economically there might be an advantage to doing it earlier than later. But more importantly, the advanced completions are driving probably incrementally more success to start with. So I don't know if that helps answer your question, but I would say that it will be somewhere in that first couple years, two to three years of development. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yes, absolutely, that does help. And I was just trying to gauge how this compares to say a refrac or something else through the life of the well, but great. And as my follow-up question, and obviously, you all had I believe tried this up in the Williston Basin, some enhanced opportunities. Several years ago, that may not have been as successful, and I know it may not be applicable everywhere. But can you compare and contrast what occurred then versus now, and if what you learned in the Eagle Ford could actually be transferred up into the Williston? Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Yeah. The Eagle Ford, as we mentioned in the call, one of the primary factors in the Eagle Ford's success is the vertical containment. The Eagle Ford is very well encased and has good strong barriers for both upward and downward growth, which is key for the process. The Bakken and many other plays are going be more challenged in that area. That's probably the key primary difference that I would say lends to the success more readily to the Eagle Ford than maybe other plays. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : And we'll move forward to our next question from Subash Chandra from Guggenheim. Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks. First question is as you talk about these 50% efficiencies in 2016 and the continued focus on ROI over growth, how does this influence your desire to outspend in a normalized oil price environment? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We have no desire or intention to consistently outspend. So the number one goal this year is to balance our discretionary cash flow with CapEx, and then of course we are working on property sales to help us reduce net debt. And if prices continue to firm, we have a lot of confidence that we're on the road to accomplishing that. We do believe that because we're seeing significant cost savings in the current drilling, we think that's going to continue, and any extra capital that we would have from cost savings, we will apply to completing new wells. And that will be \u2013 we're going be disciplined. We're certainly watching the market to make sure that we're not in a temporary uptick on prices, that the prices are more sustainable. But when we feel good about that, we will apply those cost savings to completing additional DUCs later in the year, most likely in the fourth quarter. We want to enter 2017 on a growth mode, in an uptick, so we believe that we'll have the capital to do that. Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. My follow-up is any update or guidance on, for lack of a better word, rank exploration, as we've the last couple of quarters talked about the refinement of your existing portfolio, how your progress on a new portfolio of opportunities? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, we have a very robust exploration effort on new plays, and so we have various plays actually we'll be testing this year. We'll update you that when we have some meaningful results. And then we're also picking up acreage. It's been a great time to pick up low-cost acreage in places that we couldn't get acreage in, in previous years. So we have an active program going on. Of course, we're very selective. We only want premium plays to fit into our capital program. So we're identifying rock that would meet that category and deliver those kinds of returns. So we're not shortchanging that effort at all. Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : We'll move forward to our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you, good morning, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Bill, the Austin Chalk inventory, I realize it's early days, but you haven't added to your inventory, at least not in the slide deck so far. What do you need to see there? When do you expect that you'll be able to give us some updates? I'm just thinking about the development. Again, realizing it's early days, but will you develop this concurrently with same pipes (38:05) off the Eagle Ford, or how are you thinking about that in terms of relative economics? David W. Trice - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Yeah, Doug. This is David. On the Chalk, we drilled these two wells. We've taken a couple of cores here, and we've got quite a bit of log data to go with that. So we really mapped out the play. And we're feeling pretty confident that we can move this play into the premium category and have a meaningful impact to EOG. So we're going to go ahead and test \u2013 like I mentioned in my remarks, we'll test another seven wells this year to delineate the play. And then like I said, we'll go ahead and move that into the premium inventory account. So it will be developed along with the Eagle Ford. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, we'll watch for more details. My follow-up is I've got to say, as an old reservoir hack, you guys never cease to amaze us with the things you've been able to do. And those EORs are another example of that, but it also provides us with a bit of a modeling challenge. So I'm wondering if you could, to the extent you can, help us with some ideas how you would think about fitting that into the portfolio. What I'm really getting at is, is this an individual well situation? Is it a cluster of wells? Is there a minimum area that we think about? Anything you can help us in terms of framing what the relative scale of this would look like once you get going. And maybe as an add-on, what proportion of your Eagle Ford today is ready to go in terms of being able to move this thing forward? Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Doug, this is Billy. The second part of your question there, to the extent of the acreage that might be applicable to this, honestly we just don't know at this point. We do know that there are some areas that probably will be challenged to work economically, but we are still early on in that process in trying to determine how much of the acreage is applicable. We just don't know yet. Now the 32-well pattern is probably a good indication of maybe what we'll look at in the future. It will be subsets or leases that will dictate the size of how we develop it going forward. So maybe you guys think about it instead of a single well, it will be groups of wells that will be implemented at one time and not single wells. So we're trying to give you some guidelines on what we think the capital cost is, and we tried to boil that down to a single well, just so you think about it and knowing that each lease will have different counts of wells, maybe 12 to 20 wells on a given lease. And then the production profile, we've given a cume curve out there that maybe gives you some insights on what the cume curves might look like. The production response from this is pretty unique in the sense of secondary recovery projects in that it's probably the only process that gives you such a rapid production response. You get a response in the first three months essentially, which is pretty fast. And then it holds pretty steady for a number of years. So that may be \u2013 and so that's probably about as much detail on how we see how it would be rolled out. Again the pace it's on \u2013 I know it's tough to model economically. The pace of development is purely just going to be on the things we learn from this next pilot and then our development of existing units we've used in our high-density completions. So we do expect this to increase. I would say we expect to increase the number of wells each year as we roll out the new budgets, and it will become an ever increasing part of San Antonio's capital allocation. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I appreciate the answer, Billy. Thank you. Operator : And we'll move forward to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Good morning, Bill, and to the rest of your team there. I really appreciate what you've been able to offer as disclosures here on this EOR. It's really a thought-provoking development. And I wanted to ask if you could maybe add a little bit on what's driving that range on the 30% to 70% uplift versus the original EUR because it strikes me as a wide range. And I'm wondering if perhaps part of the explanation is a function of the vintage or density of the original completions this year you're working with. Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Charles, this is Billy again. You're exactly right. I think that's a part of it. First of all, we're early in the process. So you have to remember that our forecast started out with trying to model \u2013 trying to use simulation models to match our history from the pilot projects and then forecast what the future production might be from these. So we haven't actually seen long-term production from a pilot over the number of years it would take to demonstrate what the ultimate recovery is going be. We're trying to model that with some simulation techniques, I would say, that are challenged technically. So we're working on some enhanced models to better understand what the long-term production will actually be. So I think we just need further clarifications and tests from existing pilots that we're in and future pilots to really nail that down. And then you're right. I think vintage of the completions will make a big difference. The new high-density completions we expect will respond better than some of the completions done several years ago. Our pilot projects to date have been older-style completions in large part, so we expect improvements to continue to improve. I think there's upside there. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: That's helpful color, Billy. And then if I could ask my follow-up on the Austin Chalk, I know that historically the way that play has worked is a lot of the successful wells have been a function of intersecting natural fractures. But I'm wondering if perhaps for your new concept, it's maybe the inverse of that. And if you're not avoiding natural fractures in the wellbore, perhaps you're trying to avoid them in the stimulation of the zone, and if that's part of what you're trying to figure out here. David W. Trice - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Charles, this is David. Yes, I think you're on the right path there. What we've learned is here where we're playing in the Chalk is the oil is stored a bit different than it has been in the previous history of the play. And what that does, it allows it to be a bit more predictable and also allows us to employ our completion techniques. And so I think going forward, it's just going give us a little more certainty on drilling repeatable high-quality wells. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Thanks for that. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Charles, I'd like to add to that to expound on what David said. I think the same techniques that we're finding very successful in these other plays, by identifying the very sweet spots, the very best rock quality with our proprietary techniques, and then being able to keep that bit in a very small zone in conjunction with the high-density frac, that's really the key to all these plays, and it's no different from the Chalk. So we're just finding that we can identify quality pay in the Chalk, and we're very encouraged about that. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: That's helpful, Bill. Thanks a lot. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, more questions on the EOR side. Is this a producer injector concept, or is a huff-and-puff? Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Bob, right now at this point we're not going to give you a lot of details around the process itself or how we're implementing it. But we will say that it is a miscible process. And so you can read into that what you might, but we're not really giving a lot of specific details about how we're doing that or the interaction between wells or those kind of things. Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: You guys were issued a patent for a thermal process for shale a couple years ago. This isn't that process? Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: No, it's definitely not that process. Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And could you give an idea of barrels per scuff in terms of how much gas injected versus how much incremental oil you get out? Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Again, we're not going to give a lot of details on how much gas we're injecting. But the important thing there is that \u2013 two things I guess. One is that we have gas readily available in the field. And then two, with our large footprint there and the facilities and infrastructure that we've been able to put in place for our field really enhances our ability to move gas around and get it to these leases to take advantage of this EOR process. It really helps position EOG uniquely to be able to take advantage of something like this. Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And then a final one, should we trust Railroad Commission lease level production? Will that be able to help us figure out incremental volumes, or is it just all wrapped up at the pad level so we can't \u2013 or lease level so we won't be able to see it? Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: We're reporting production on a lease basis as we're required to do under the Railroad Commission rules. And certainly, over time there may be some things you can glean from that data. We'll see. Honestly, I have not checked a lot of that data to see what does it look like versus what we see internally. But I think over time, you'll be able to discern what the actual results are, and I would expect that data will become apparent in the future. Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you very much. Operator : We'll move forward to our next question from Pearce Hammond with Simmons Piper Jaffray. Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Good morning. On the Austin Chalk, is your acreage already held by virtue of your completions in the Eagle Ford since you would hold all depth above the Eagle Ford? And then are you leasing any additional acreage? Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Yes, Pearce. Yes, we would. We hold the Austin Chalk with our Eagle Ford production. So yes, it sits right above the Eagle Ford. And the second part of your question was? Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Are you leasing any additional acreage? Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: As you know, there in the Eagle Ford the acreage is held pretty tight. So at this point, we're not leasing anything new on the Austin. Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): And then my follow-up, with the EOR technology, what do you think this does to your base decline? It seems like it would cause your Eagle Ford base declines to moderate significantly over time once you apply this technology in full force. Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Pearce, I think that's right. I think overall benefit in the long term is it will help flatten the decline. The long-life decline from the field, we still haven't been able to quantify that yet. But we're certainly very optimistic that it will certainly be very meaningful to not only the individual leases but over the field in general. Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Thank you, Billy. Operator : And we'll move forward to our next question from David Tameron with Wells Fargo. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, a couple questions. One, on the Austin Chalk, I guess one, how prospective do you think this is? Like how big is that sweet spot as a subset of your total Eagle Ford position? And then as I just start thinking about what \u2013 and I don't know if you guys will talk about it, but what are you doing differently? What can you give us as far as \u2013 or give the Street as far as confidence that this isn't the same Austin Chalk that's in everybody's head? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : David, this is Bill Thomas. As far as the potential on our acreage, we're encouraged because we see data, rock data and test data, on various parts of our acreage that are encouraging. And so we have seven wells, additional wells, additional to the two we've already drilled that we have planned this year that we'll be testing some of these concepts. And so once we get those done and we get some results that confirm the production like we've seen, then we'll be able to I think give people an update that will be more meaningful on what the scope could be. And then on the technical side of it, let me let David update you on that part of the question. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. David W. Trice - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Like I mentioned before, we have collected a substantial amount of data. Pretty much all of the Eagle Ford wells that we've drilled have drilled down through the chalk. So we have a very good set of log data, seismic data, and like I mentioned before, core data to delineate this. So that's what gives us confidence. And as well, there have been other industry wells drilled. Some of the larger operators have not necessarily drilled very good wells, but some of the smaller operators have drilled some really good wells along this trend. Some of them have cum-ed 300,000 to 400,000 barrels of oil in the first year. So these are substantial wells. And like I mentioned before, based on the data we have, we think they're very repeatable. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : David, the technical advantages from a competitive standpoint are, I think, our ability to recognize these pay zones and then target those pay zones. That is before what we've learned on the other plays is applying to the Austin Chalk. So we're just taking this targeting, precision targeting a step further to the chalk, and we think that's very proprietary knowledge at this point. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, I appreciate that color, just one more follow-up. If I think about \u2013 and if you covered this, I apologize. I don't think I heard anybody talk about it. But as far as the DUC balance going into 2017, I know some of the rigs are coming off contract. How should we think about the way you want to manage that going forward? Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer : This is Gary Thomas, David. What we've shared before is we're just going be completing roughly 270 wells this year, drilling about 200 wells. So we'll be completing roughly 70 of our DUCs. And we're just, as Bill said, we've got these in inventory. When we see prices improve and we have additional capital, this will be just a source of assets that we can develop rapidly to bring on production when it's justified. David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks for the time this morning. Operator : And we'll move forward to our next question from Irene Haas with Wunderlich. Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Very quickly, this enhanced oil recovery process, how sensitive it is to gas prices? Right now we're at an all-time low. But what if one of these days gas shoots up to $4.00 or $5.00 per Mcf, how would the process work then? Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Yeah. Irene, we've certainly taken a look at a lot of different pricing scenarios. But we've looked at it in the sense of what we're currently modeling and also incrementally up to $5.00 gas prices, and we still see incremental benefit and good economics even up to those levels. So our economic sensitivity is not really a factor of what we think gas prices could be anywhere in the near future. So I think it's going to continue to be economic even at what we see could be a foreseeable gas price in the future. Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Great, thank you. Operator : And we'll move forward to our next question with Brian Singer. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you, good morning. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Brian. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I wanted to see if you can give us an update on your rig contracts. How many are rolling off at the end of the year? And more importantly, what is your minimum or what are your commitments for 2017, and to tie that in a little with the discussion here on EOR and DUCs, whether you can get to a point or whether it can be meaningful enough from your investment in EOR and reducing DUCs where you can essentially have rigless growth in 2017? Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer : This is Gary. We have 11 rigs under contract currently, and that will decline to nine rigs at the end of the year. So we'll really average about nine rigs because we started with 15 rigs there in January. And then next year, we'll start with eight rigs and that will decline to four rigs, so we'll average about 5.5 rigs in 2017. So yes, we will have some DUCs, but we'll have quite a number of wells that we'll be able to drill. And we've got quite a few of these patterns we'd like to further develop, so we'll maintain certainly more than 5.5 rigs in 2017. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it, thanks. And then to follow up on both the DUCs and the EOR locations, on the DUCs, could you characterize how many of your DUCs would be locations you would regard as premium locations if you were drilling these wells now? And then on the EOR locations, can you characterize how many locations in the Eagle Ford over the last two to five years have been drilled in the area with the completion techniques where you could apply EOR right away if you wanted to? Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer : Yes, first you had a long question here. As far as the premium DUCs, roughly 100 of the DUCs are in the Eagle Ford. Most all those are going be premium. We've got some there in the Permian Basin; they'll also be premium. The neat thing here is when you look at it on a finding cost basis, our new drilling is roughly $10 a barrel of oil equivalent. And when you look at the DUCs, having already spent the dollars to drill, it's probably in the $7 range. So those all look pretty darn good. Now as far as on our Eagle Ford and plugged wells have the modern completion to fit with EOR. By the time we get these patterns developed, a large portion, the majority of our wells will have the more modern completion. So that's what Bill and Billy are talking about now. And just mentioning that, we want to go ahead and further develop these because we're still working on our spacing and we need get our spacing down there in the Eagle Ford. So with that, the vast majority of the wells will have modern completion, very fitting for EOR. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you. Operator : And, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : In closing, the first thing I would like to say is that we're extremely proud of all the EOG employees. They're doing an incredible job this year of resetting EOG to be successful in a lower price environment. The second thought I'd leave you with is that EOG continues to focus on long-term value creation by making sure that every dollar we invest today is making a strong return, and growth should be a product of making great returns. So because of the tremendous technology and efficiency gains, the company has the ability to make strong returns in a $40 oil environment. And this uniquely positions EOG to continue its leadership in high-return U.S. oil growth as prices improve. So thanks for listening and thanks for your support. Operator : And, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

An updated IR presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening, and we included guidance for the third quarter and full year 2016 in yesterday's press release. This morning we'll discuss topics in the following order. Bill Thomas will review our shift to premium drilling and the long-term growth outlook we introduced in yesterday's press release. Billy Helms and David Trice will review notable achievements in select plays. I will then discuss EOG's financials and capital structure, and Bill will provide concluding remarks. Here's Bill Thomas. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. EOG's goal during this downturn has been squarely focused on resetting the company to be successful in a low commodity price environment. We are focused on lowering operational costs and achieving a strong return on capital invested in a $40 oil environment. Our goal is to continue to be the U.S. leader in investment returns and be competitive with the lowest cost producers in the global oil market. On this call this morning we have important updates that highlight significant progress towards reaching our goals. First, per unit lease operating costs decreased by 27% in the first half of 2016 versus 2015, and per unit cash operating costs in the first half are down 15% compared to full-year 2015 and 30% below 2014 levels. Second, with outstanding capital efficiency gains, we exceeded the high end of our second quarter U.S. oil production target, and we are increasing our full-year U.S. oil forecast by 2% without increasing CapEx guidance. Third, we have increased our premium inventory by 34% and increased our premium reserve potential by a whopping 75%. And fourth, we closed on $425 million of non-core property sales this year. Along with maintaining our strong balance sheet, we are updating our portfolio by investing in high-return premium assets. As a reminder, a premium well is defined by an after-tax direct rate of return of at least 40% at $40 oil. We believe this metric makes EOG unique in the U.S. when it comes to quality of inventory and investment returns. There are a few additional points regarding this definition of premium that I want to be sure are very clear. Number one, 30% is a minimum return. This means the average return for our premium drilling inventory is clearly higher. Number two, 30% was selected as a minimum so that the fully-loaded investment, including all indirect costs, generates a healthy all-in corporate rate of return. Number three, 30% at $40 oil is the premium benchmark regardless of what the prevailing market price for oil is, meaning if oil goes to $50 or $60, the returns quickly move into the triple-digit range. Finally, premium inventory is a return-based metric. It can be achieved by cost reductions or productivity increases or a combination of both. Because our technical and efficiency gains are sustainable, we are confident that a large majority of our remaining inventory will be converted to premium over time. EOG's shift to premium is a new chapter for the company. Premium drilling establishes a higher permanent standard for capital allocation, and therefore will significantly increase capital productivity over time. This shift enables EOG to deliver high-return robust growth using far less capital at a far lower oil price. Which leads me to another highlight from yesterday's press release, the 2020 growth outlook we provided. Due to the sustainable gains in well productivity and cost, we can grow oil production at a 10% compound annual growth rate at $50 oil. At $60 oil, our compound annual growth rate jumps to 20%. And most importantly, we can deliver that oil production growth while covering our capital expenditures and our dividend with cash flow, enabling us to meet our goal of maintaining a strong balance sheet. As prices improve, we expect to incrementally reduce the net debt-to-capital ratio to our historical norm of 30% or less by generating free cash flow and, to a lesser extent, through non-core property sales. While the shift to premium drilling has tremendous impact on EOG's returns, growth, and capital productivity, the question remains. Is this shift really permanent? In other words, can EOG continue to replace its premium inventory? And the answer is yes. The three ways we add premium inventory are conversion, exploration, and acquisition. The first and most immediate way is through conversion. Converting well locations that were on the edge of the 30% hurdle rate is a source of the 1,100 new premium locations we announced yesterday. Furthermore, we have much more inventory on the verge of conversion. By improving well productivity or lowering cost, in most cases both, we expect much of our current non-premium inventory in the top basins to be converted to premium over time. Improvements to well productivity and cost savings are ongoing and never ending. In a moment, Billy Helms and David Trice will talk more about how productivity improvements, cost reductions, and longer laterals will add to premium inventory. The second way we add premium inventory is through exploration. EOG is a leader in organic exploration growth because at our core we are an exploration-driven company. In this lower commodity price environment, we have not stopped looking. With EOG's decentralized structure, we have six experienced exploration teams in the U.S. generating new ideas, acquiring leases, and developing new plays. EOG is a prospect generating machine, and our shift to premium has not slowed that effort down. In fact, it has enhanced the return hurdle by which new plays are evaluated. The third way we expect to add premium inventory is through targeted bolt-on acquisitions. Due to the current low commodity cost environment, we are actively pursuing opportunities to capture top-tier acreage. We were successful on four such transactions in the Delaware Basin last year, and are optimistic we can execute on more through this down cycle. I am confident that we can replace premium-level drilling every year through conversions, exploration, and acquisitions. And as I said last quarter, this shift to premium drilling is permanent and it's a game-changing event for EOG. Now I'll turn it over to Billy Helms to discuss the Eagle Ford. Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Exploration & Production: Thanks, Bill. As highlighted in the press release yesterday, we added 390 net locations to our Eagle Ford premium inventory. That's a 25% increase to our original estimate six months ago, and takes the total premium well count in the Eagle Ford to almost 2,000 locations. Two thousand locations represents 10 years of premium high-return drilling. What's more, there are at least 2,000 more Eagle Ford locations that are on the verge of premium designation. To convert these locations, we will need to reduce current well cost by 10% or improve EURs by 10%. Slide 11 of our investor presentation illustrates this. By making small, very attainable improvements, we can add another 10 years of premium high-return Eagle Ford inventory from our existing acreage. I am confident we will make this conversion over time. One of the ways we convert locations to premium is by drilling longer laterals. Our success in the western Eagle Ford, as illustrated on slide nine, is a good example. The trick with longer laterals is to maintain, or preferably enhance, productivity per foot of lateral. Due to engineering breakthroughs in EOG's completion design, we have gone out as far as two miles with no degradation in productivity per foot. While longer laterals will be one source of future premium inventory, two more significant sources will be EOG's focus on performance improvement through advancing our technical understanding and lowering cost. On the technical side, geological and geophysical advancements enable us to refine our precision targeting efforts. For example, we are determining where there may be multiple lower Eagle Ford targets to support drilling a W pattern. We are also working to understand where the upper Eagle Ford is prospective. While the prospective area for the upper Eagle Ford is geographically limited, there are some sweet spots that may contribute premium well locations. Finally, as we discussed last quarter, we will be completing seven additional Austin Chalk wells and continue to delineate the play and understand its full potential. On the cost side, we are finding creative ways to drive costs down further. We are drilling more wells per pad with more efficient rigs designed for pad drilling. The rig design allows for simultaneous operations such as conducting drilling and cementing operations on multiple wells at the same time, reducing both time and cost. On the completion side, we continue to optimize proppant schedules and stage lengths, reduce cost for items like sand and chemicals, while maintaining the EOG high-density completion process. Our continuing focus on every facet of our operations has allowed us to drop Eagle Ford total well cost another 11% year to date to $5.1 million. Also, we continue to be encouraged with our enhanced oil recovery or EOR projects. As a reminder, the process is highly economic and provides another way to create premium inventory. It not only increases the recovery, but also provides a means to flatten the field production decline. Finally, I'll draw your attention to slide 23. We added another line to the chart representing 2016 year-to-date cumulative production. Year after year, we improve our well productivity in the Eagle Ford. Much of this year's increase can be attributed to our shift to premium drilling. However, as slide five illustrates, just 60% of our 2016 drilling program is premium, so we expect to see this chart show improvement for many years to come. Now here's David Trice. David W. Trice - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Thanks, Billy. Like the Eagle Ford, the Delaware Basin also added to its premium drilling inventory. Five hundred twenty net locations were added across all three plays, the Wolfcamp, Second Bone Spring, and Leonard. The new premium total now stands at more than 1,700 locations. That's almost 20 years of premium high-return drilling. In the Delaware Basin, the main driver of premium additions was improvement in well productivity through better targeting and completions. For example, slide seven of the investor presentation shows EOG's 2016 Wolfcamp oil wells produced more than 200,000 barrels equivalent on average in the first 180 days. That's a 17% increase in the 180-day cumulative oil production over wells in our 2015 program. More importantly, it shows a 45% uplift over a typical 750 MBOE well, which is the gross per well EUR given in our last Wolfcamp update. Finally, it's worth noting that the data in this chart is normalized to 4,500-foot laterals, meaning EOG's 4,500-foot laterals in the Delaware Basin are as good or better than the 10,000-foot laterals in the Midland Basin. In addition to productivity gains, longer laterals in the Delaware Basin are another way we've added premium locations to the Wolfcamp as well as the other two plays. Innovations made to wellbore design in the last six months allow us to drill longer while still applying high-density completions so that we do not sacrifice long-term reserves. The new design will allow us to maintain high recovery rates on the longer laterals while lowering costs and increasing returns. Sixteen gross Wolfcamp oil and combo wells were brought online in the second quarter, with an average 30-day rate of more than 2,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day and an average lateral length of 6,500 feet. These are industry-leading Wolfcamp results regardless of operator or basin, as shown on slide eight of our investor presentation. EOG expects to complete 70 Wolfcamp wells in 2016. While the effort in the last couple years has clearly been focused on the Wolfcamp, we have been able to collect a tremendous amount of data on all of the shallower targets such as the Second Bone Spring and the Leonard Shale. Despite limited drilling this year, results in the Second Bone Spring have also been impressive. Ninety-day cumulative production has increased 27% over 2015 wells and 60% better than a typical 500 MBOE well. The Second Bone Spring tends to be more stratigraphically complex, so additional data we collect from drilling Wolfcamp wells has aided in much better targeting, longer laterals, and more premium wells. We expect similar or better uplifts to our Leonard Shale results on a go-forward basis. In the Rockies, we've had great success in the Powder River Basin and Wyoming DJ Basin. As announced in our press release yesterday, we drilled three Turner wells last quarter that averaged almost 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Completed well costs, which include drilling, completion, and on-lease facilities averaged $5.4 million for a 6,500-foot lateral, down from $6.5 million in 2015. These Turner wells are incredibly economic at $40 oil. We plan to drill a total of 20 net wells in the Turner this year. When we conducted our first count of premium inventory in December of last year, the DJ Basin Codell in Wyoming was slightly below the premium threshold. Due to sustainable cost reductions and better targeting, we added 200 premium locations in this play. Currently, Codell wells cost $5.9 million for a 9,400-foot lateral. As noted in press release yesterday, our latest Codell well produced approximately 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent in the first 30 days. We expect costs and well improvements to continue and are working to expand gas takeaway options in Wyoming. The DJ Basin Codell will become a larger part of our premium drilling program in the near future. In the East Irish Sea, I'm happy to report that Conwy is currently producing approximately 10,000 barrels of oil per day. During the second quarter, Conwy was down due to issues on the Douglas production platform. While Conwy wells were initially tested at a daily rate over more than 20,000 barrels of oil, results from recent production testing indicate that the optimal level of production is 10,000 barrels of oil per day. For the remainder of the year, we expect to average about 4,000 to 8,000 barrels of oil per day to accommodate further tests and potential downtime. Here's Tim Driggers. Timothy K. Driggers - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : Thanks, David. Capitalized interest for the second quarter of 2016 was $9 million. Exploration and development expenditures were $624 million excluding property acquisitions, which is 49% less as compared to second quarter 2015, while our total production volumes decreased by just 2%. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants, and other property, plant, and equipment were $20 million. We have maintained our full-year capital expenditure guidance of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. At the end of June 2016, total debt outstanding was $7 billion and the debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 37%. At June 30, we had $780 million of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $6.2 billion, for a net debt-to-total cap ratio of 34%. Year to date, we have sold $425 million of assets with associated production of 45 million cubic feet per day of natural gas, 3,300 barrels of oil per day, and 3,700 barrels per day of NGLs. Assets sold include Midland Basin and Colorado DJ Basin properties. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 23%, and the deferred tax ratio was 214%. Now I'll turn it back over to Bill. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Tim; now a brief word on our macro view and how it relates to our 2016 plans. Even though oil prices have been volatile, our view of supply/demand fundamentals has not changed. We believe $40 oil will not provide enough cash flow or investment return to overcome the combined effect of production decline and demand growth worldwide. While EOG can deliver healthy growth in cash flow at $50 oil, we continue to believe the U.S. horizontal oil industry as a whole needs a sustained $60 oil price and extended lead time to deliver a moderate level of growth. As we discussed last quarter, the substantial reduction in capital investments by the industry since 2014 is causing oil supply to decline in many producing regions worldwide. As production continues to decline, the inventory overhang will slowly work off. The consensus view is the market will balance during 2017. For 2016, given the uncertainty of the current commodity environment, we are maintaining our CapEx guidance at $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. However, as a result of cost savings, we are increasing our well count to 250 drilled wells and 350 completed wells. This is an additional 50 wells drilled and 80 completions above our original plan for the same CapEx. In summary, I would like to leave you with the following important takeaways from this call. Number one, we continue to reduce operating costs. We believe these reductions are sustainable, and we have additional efforts underway to reduce future operational costs. Number two, our shift to premium is achieving what we believe are the strongest investment returns at $40 oil in the U.S. Number three, our shift to premium is permanent. We are confident we can grow premium quality inventory much faster than we drill it. Number four, we continue to exceed our U.S. production targets by increasing capital efficiency. We believe these efficiency gains are sustainable and give EOG a significant advantage as we enter the next recovery. And number five, we are maintaining our strong balance sheet through disciplined spending. I'll close this call with our view of EOG's future through 2020. There are four goals we plan to achieve. The first goal is to be the U.S. leader in rate of return on capital investments. The second goal is to be the low-cost U.S. producer and therefore competitive in the global oil market. Our third goal is to be the leader in Lower 48 absolute oil growth through 2020. And our fourth goal is to maintain a strong balance sheet through disciplined spending. By achieving these four goals, we will accomplish our ultimate goal of creating long-term shareholder value. Producing growth by consistently outspending and drilling uneconomic wells is not in EOG's vocabulary. We firmly believe that growth should be the result of strong returns and disciplined spending. EOG's unwavering commitment to our long-term shareholders is to focus on returns first. The company is uniquely positioned to produce strong returns and resume high-return growth as commodity prices improve. Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our first question today from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning, everybody, and good results to close out earnings here. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Evan. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: My first question, Bill, is how quickly can you get into the 10% annual growth rate, the bottom of your new growth at $50? It looks a little bit back-end loaded on slide 14. And I guess my question is, do DUCs allow for fast return? And what signals do you need to add rigs to move towards these targets? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, of course, Evan. The driver is oil price. And as oil prices improve above the $50 level, the more capital we'll add and the faster we'll ramp up our activity. We're not limited on beginning out very significantly. We have ongoing operations and enough rigs and equipment going now, and the DUCs really help us get off to a good start. But it is, as you can tell from the chart on slide 14, it's not 10% every year. So 2017 will start off incrementally at a lower rate, and then we'll build from there as we go forward. And of course, as volumes grow, cash flow grows too, so the process multiplies itself as we go forward. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: What drives the higher growth in the back end of the decade? Does that reflect the EUR base decline management, or is that all an effect from premium locations? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The whole driver for us being able to grow at these kinds of rates at these low oil prices is really the switch to premium and the lowering of the well cost at the same time. The productivity of the wells is just a tremendous uptick from where we were in 2014, and so the capital efficiency I believe has more than doubled since that time. We did not put in the outlook, we did not put any EOR investments in there or production response, so that's really not a part of the outlook that we did. Of course, the EOR has great capital efficiency. It's just as good as premium, and we're working it in over time as is appropriate. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, I'll leave there for somebody else. Thanks. Operator : And we'll go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thanks, good morning, everybody. Bill, this is pretty exciting. Obviously, we see this as the formal change I guess. I guess the question I have is you could pretty much, assuming you're right on the macro, you could pretty much assume to grow at whatever pace you want as it relates to inventory. I'm guessing a 10% hurdle is not, for your track record, that difficult to achieve. So what are the constraints that you see to EOG's growth aspirations as relates to people, infrastructure, and maybe even a switch in capital towards EOR or back to shareholders? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Doug, the constraints would be \u2013 I think the biggest one would be we don't want to lose the capital efficiency gains that we have built in right now, and so we don't want to go so fast that we're bringing in equipment and people and spending money and drilling wells and really lose these efficiency gains that we've got right now. So if oil, say, went to $70 or $60 or $70 really quick, we could ramp up appropriately, but we wouldn't do it overnight. We couldn't do it overnight. We would have to build up the service quality, and we would certainly want to maintain our efficiencies that we've already built in. That's the one thing we don't want to do. Of course, we want to focus on our balance sheet and to get that net debt-to-cap back down to below 30% also. So I believe I'll let Gary Thomas chime in on that. He can give some color on that. Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer : Yes, Doug. As Bill was saying, the premium drilling is what helps us with the growth forward because it just requires fewer wells, and we'll not be having to ramp up to the number of rigs that we had, for instance, in 2014. And another reason is because of the productivity by rig. If you could, look at Exhibit 20 showing that. But we've got a plan in place to be able to ramp up to maintain our efficiencies and more than likely continue to reduce our costs. Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: I appreciate the answer. Go on... William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : To answer your question on would we buy back shares, that's really not in our plans at this time. We're not opportunity limited. That's an important part of the process. And so geologically, we don't have an opportunity limit there. So we would ramp up appropriately to maintain the discipline and to reduce the debt at the same time. Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Bill, I appreciate the detailed answer. Hopefully my quick follow-up is just on the balance sheet. Clearly, there are going be some assets that maybe don't make it into the premium inventory. So as you've now made this permanent shift, rather than get specific, could you quantify for us? What impact on your base production do you think disposals could ultimately represent? Because obviously that would amplify the implied growth rate going forward. And I'll leave it there, thanks. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Doug, on the oil growth rate, I don't believe it's going impact it significantly at all. The things that we've targeted this year are mostly gassy properties to sell. And as we go forward, they would either be kind of combo-ish or gas properties going forward. So on the oil growth, property sales shouldn't be a factor much at all. Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: I appreciate that. Thanks, guys. Operator : Next is Pearce Hammond with Simmons. Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray : Good morning and thanks for the helpful long-term plan. My first question is given the rise in completion activity, do you believe you have enough access to enough Texas-based finer sands, or will you need to use more of the white sands, potentially requiring you to reactivate your Wisconsin mines? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Exploration & Production: Pearce, we have both available to us. We've been working on our own Texas mines and plant and expanding there as far as our capability, as well as working on our Wisconsin plant, being able to reduce costs and put in place improved transportation. So we believe that we have adequate sand, and we believe we've been able to lower our sand cost as well, and we're seeing that helping our cost here in 2016. So we've got plenty of sand available. We feel like we've got most all of our resources available to us as well. The thing that's really helped us during this downturn is we've been able to just continue increasing our efficiencies. And before, I probably mentioned that we thought that as far as our cost reductions, maybe two-thirds were sustainable. With what we've seen here from 2015 going to 2016, we've lowered our well cost in all of our areas somewhere 11% to 13%, and that's just through increased efficiencies. So those will go forward with us. Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray : Thank you, Billy, very helpful. And then my follow-up. Bill, as you look at the non-premium inventory, big picture thought, does it make sense to divest more of it, or do you need to hold on to some of it and let technology catch up to that so you can move the acreage into the premium category? So I just want to get your big picture thoughts on how you view that non-premium inventory. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, Pearce, I'll let Billy address that, Billy Helms. Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Exploration & Production: Yes, Pearce. So in our inventory, as we continue to demonstrate, we can add more and more to our premium inventory. There's some of the inventory that may never make it to that. So we're looking at what options are best to bring that value forward, whether it's monetize that property or produce it out for a period of time or whatever the optionality is. We have a tremendous amount of flexibility. We haven't designated certain properties yet to be put on the market, but we'll just be opportunistic in that approach and evaluate each one independently. We haven't really considered any of those volumes, as Bill said, in our four-year or five-year plan. And so as he mentioned, they'll be mostly gas or gas combo-type plays, so that really won't affect oil production guidance any. Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray : Thank you. Operator : And we'll now go to Subash Chandra with Guggenheim. Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good morning. So the question was, in creating these premium locations, do you find the best rock gets better, or are you equally successful in converting Tier 1/Tier 2 rock to premium? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Exploration & Production: I think the rock quality is a very big driver on the premium, and the higher the quality of the rock, the better it responds to the technical advances we make in the completions. There's no question about that. So I think one of the things that's not clearly understood in the horizontal shale industry is that these sweet spots in these plays, especially in the oil plays, are not very large. So capturing the very highest quality rock is extremely important and certainly something that EOG has excelled in and focused on over the years, and it really is the biggest driver of productivity. Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. My follow-up is, how many completion crews do you have active in your basins, and is there a rig count-to-completion crew ratio that we should think about? Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer : This is Gary Thomas. We have now eight completion units running and we've got anywhere from 11 to 12 rigs, and that's a pretty good ratio as far as an average. Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Could you scale up the rig count without adding completion units materially? Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer : We could, yes. It depends on where you add the rigs. If we added in the Eagle Ford, we would have to add fewer completion units, for instance, there. They're just so efficient after having operated there for the last seven or eight years. Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC : All right, thank you. Great quarter, thanks. Operator : Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank is next. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys, maybe a couple points of clarity. Can you talk about \u2013 the incremental 50 wells drilled in 2016 and the 80 completions, does that involve any rig additions, or are you completing that with the existing rigs and crews that you have on hand? Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer : This is Gary Thomas. What we've been able to do is just the tremendous efficiency improvements have allowed us to go ahead and do this with the same number of drilling rigs. We will be adding one or two completion units here through the second half to go ahead and take care of the 350 completions in this round. It's all being done within existing capital, planned capital. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's great, thanks. And then maybe as we look out over the next couple years, can you talk about the allocation of capital between the Eagle Ford and the Permian? As you look into 2017 and 2018, what's the expected split between capital going to each basin, and how will that change as you look forward over the next two or three years? And is that reflective of the relative rates of return between the two assets? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : As we look into 2017 and forward, the capital will be \u2013 about 45% will be in the Eagle Ford, about 45% in the Delaware, and then about 10% in the Rockies. That's a rough balance between each one of those areas. Of course, the one we've increased capital most this year is in the Delaware Basin, and that will be increased again going forward. The rates of return that we're getting in the Delaware are just outstanding as the well results we've talked about today. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So is it purely a rate of return driven exercise? The Delaware wells, have they risen to the top, or is it also a reflection of depth of inventory, infrastructure, things like that? Or is it just returns driven? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It's certainly returns driven, but I would say of those three areas, if we look at our current scorecard, the returns on all three of those areas are about equal. So it has to do with inventory and returns and of course, operational efficiency. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thank you very much. Operator : We'll go to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Good morning, Bill, and to the rest of your team there. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: I'd like to pick up on the theme that you mentioned a couple times in your remarks about improved capital efficiency. And certainly we're seeing that in spades today with you increasing your completed well count \u2013 or your completions by 30% and your wells drilled by 25% with the same CapEx. But I think I get the theme that this is really driven by your shift to premium drilling, and I'm looking at that left half of the slide five you have where you lay out your plans for the next few years. Is that ongoing shift to premium a fair weather vane to look at for how capital efficiency will continue to improve in 2017 and 2018, or is it the kind of thing that you think you've seen the beginnings and we shouldn't expect a whole lot more from this point forward? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, that chart is very indicative of the way that capital efficiency goes. So I believe this year it's about 60% premium. Next year it's 81% premium. And then I think from 2018 forward it's 98%. So as we complete more premium wells each year, the capital efficiency will increase. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Got it, that's helpful. Thank you. And then if I could pick up on one of the big themes from last quarter, your Austin Chalk activity, I think I heard you mention that you're still excited about that play. Can you give us a sense? Are any of those locations in your premium count right now, perhaps under the overall Eagle Ford heading, or is this still in the exploration bucket waiting to be promoted somewhere down the road? David W. Trice - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Charles, this is David. As far as the Austin Chalk goes, like we mentioned last quarter, we're still delineating that play. So we're still intending to drill nine wells throughout our whole acreage position there. And currently, we don't have any Austin Chalk within our premium count, but that's clearly a potential for some upside there. Just like Bill had mentioned, one of the ways that we're going to add premium in the future is through exploration. So the wells that we've brought on, as we talked about last quarter, are clearly premium. So we're still excited about that play, but we need a little bit more data on it. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: That's helpful insight, thank you. Operator : We'll go to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you, good morning. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Brian. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Bill, you've recently spoken a bit less on the topic of recovery rate. But given that you are increasing your premium inventory in part because of productivity gains and longer laterals, I wonder if you could provide an update on where you see recovery rates, particularly in the Delaware and Eagle Ford, and then the opportunity from here for further technology and productivity gains to increase resource in premium inventory and overall recoveries. Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Exploration & Production: Brian, this is Billy Helms. On the recovery rates, we've gotten away from quoting what we think the overall recovery rate is by zone. But needless to say, it's improving. I think a large part of that, a very significant part of that is what Bill talked about earlier. It's understanding the rock, our shift to better define what targeting is, and then deploying our high-density completion process. It's really made a huge difference on the recovery rates. We really don't focus on what that recovery rate percentage is. It really doesn't help us understand our go-forward models on how these wells will perform. So it really hasn't been a focus for us, but that's the color I would give to you is that they're definitely improving with time. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Maybe I'll ask it in a slightly different way then, since you talked about the targeting and the enhanced completions specifically. What inning do you think we're in, in terms of the impact that those technological improvements are having on your productivity? Is there still a big gap? Even if you're not specific on the recovery rates, is there still a big gap where there's the opportunity for further use of these technologies to increase recovery? And are the benefits from targeting and enhanced completions fully baked into your premium resource and premium locations? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Brian, this is Bill. The targeting, we started that I believe in the latter part of 2014, and it's really in different stages and different basins. In the Eagle Ford, it's more mature there. We're probably still in the sixth inning. I've been saying this for years, but we're probably still in the sixth inning there of understanding what is the best target and working it into our W patterns and our spacing patterns. So as we get more data, even in a very mature area like the Eagle Ford, we get more data. We continue to find out more about the rock and the section, and we're able to discriminate and pick better rock all the time. So it's an ongoing process even there. In the Delaware Basin, we're probably in the second or third inning there. There's so much potential pay there, and we're still learning and we've got a lot of data to gather. As we drill the Delaware wells, we're focused on the Wolfcamp, particularly using those fantastic wells. But number two, you get to see all the Bone Spring sands and all the pays above you. And so you're gathering data as you drill these wells, and that helps with delineating targets and working the stratigraphy out in mapping. So each one of the plays is at a different position on improvements, but we think there's really a long way to go. We're not anywhere close to the end of being able to make additional improvements on that side of the business or on the cost side too. So it's an ongoing process and it's a very sustainable process. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you. Operator : We'll go to Irene Haas with Wunderlich. Please go ahead. Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Following up on the Delaware Basin, your inventory count of about 2,130 wells, I'm curious as to \u2013 for the Wolfcamp. I think mostly in Wolfcamp A, and you're doing work on the deeper horizons. Are there more headroom to add locations without really adding more acreage? David W. Trice - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: Irene, this is David. In the Wolfcamp, really what we've targeted mostly there, we've got several targets in the upper Wolfcamp, so there are quite a few premium targets. Like Bill mentioned earlier, we're still early in the Wolfcamp, so we still see quite a bit of upside there. But clearly from the data that we show, like on the chart seven in our investor book, we've made some big progress there. These are clearly premium wells. As we go forward, we're going to have the ability to drill more and more of them with longer laterals. Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: A follow-up question, I was wondering. How far are you along with your database, how many wells you have inputted in your position targeting model? Do you use existing vertical wells, horizontal wells, and core samples? I'm just trying to get a feeling as to how much more data you might need to really nail it perfectly. David W. Trice - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production: There's a lot of industry data out there, legacy log data and everything that's helped us with that. But really what's going to drive it more than anything is, as we drill the wells and complete them and gather the data over time, you'll continue to see some improvement there. Just like you've seen, we never stop learning. We've continued to test the limits, and so I still think there's plenty of upside on the Wolfcamp. Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Great, thank you. Operator : We'll now go to Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I had a high-level question and then a follow-up. The high-level question is, it looks like you've added, say, 34% to your net locations, to premium, but the average EUR went up 75%. What's driving that? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Really, Bob, it's just the combination of better rock and better completions, and now we're going to add longer laterals to that too. So the well results, the productivity of the well increase is just very, very large and incredible. I think once there's enough of this data out in the big databases where people can analyze it and compare EOG wells versus the industry or really any other operator drilling horizontal oil wells now, they're going be very, very surprised and very, very impressed. We do have one chart in the slide deck that compares our Wolfcamp results to other operators. I believe it's slide number eight. So you might want to look at that, but the wells are just fantastic wells. Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. The follow-up is, could you talk a little about the process by which a location moves or gets blessed as premium? Is that done by the asset? Is it blessed by headquarters? Is it statistical, or is it sticks on a map? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It's a process that really is done in our division offices. So our decentralized culture that's focused on the details right there, they're evaluating the rock, driving the costs down at the same time, and executing on the wells. They know their properties the best, and they are constantly working. And they are so focused on improving returns and improving productivity and driving down cost. So they're really driving this whole thing, and it is an amazing performance that's going on. Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And there's sticks on a map there. Those locations are known lat/longs [latitude/longitude]? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Absolutely, yes. The well count are absolute sticks on a map. They all have a well name. Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So they're not like a spreadsheet. Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. Operator : We'll go to Mike Scialla with Stifel. Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning. Bill, you said in your prepared remarks that the minimum 30% IRR for premium wells translates to a healthy corporate rate of return. Is there a minimum ROE you can equate that to, or does that necessarily translate to positive earnings? William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We picked the 30% because when you pull in our full-cost of capital, which would be infrastructure, land, G&G (53:22) and things like that, it usually draws the return down to maybe 15%. So we would like to have a minimum full-cost all-in call it capital cost rate of return of about 15%. Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thanks. And then, Billy, you mentioned in your prepared remarks you're seeing no degradation in productivity per foot with these longer lateral lengths. I guess is there anything specific there without giving away the trade secrets that you can talk about, maybe bigger casing size or something like that that's preventing that degradation in recoveries per foot with the long laterals? And I was wondering too, you mentioned the Eagle Ford and the Delaware, where you're going with the longer laterals. On the Eagle Ford side, is that really confined to the western portion of the play, or does it have any application in the east as well? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Exploration & Production: Mike, this is Billy Helms. So on the Eagle Ford, first of all, for both the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin, when we drill a longer lateral, we definitely want to make sure that we are maximizing the recovery. We're not losing efficiencies as we just drill longer laterals. So we've spent a lot of time \u2013 our operational groups have spent a tremendous amount of time trying to understand how to accomplish that. And the results we've seen so far have shown they've been very successful at maintaining that productivity per foot, especially when it results in \u2013 we're talking about EUR per foot mainly. Certainly, the initial production can somewhat be diluted a little bit just due to the longer laterals and flowing larger volumes up, restrictions on chokes and surface things, surface facilities. But the EUR per foot has been maintaining a pretty steady pace. So that's really encouraging. Now, I won't get into exactly how we're doing that. We do feel like that that is an advancement we've made internally, and we want to keep that a little bit proprietary at this time. But on the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin, both of those are benefiting from that and will continue to benefit from that. Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And in the Eagle Ford, is it really on the western side of the play, or does the east have any application? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Exploration & Production: Yes, probably more so on the western, but certainly the east side also has opportunities for that. But the east side also has a little bit more geological complexity that hampers that a little bit. But certainly, there are opportunities, and we'll find that where we can. Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, thank you. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think we've got time for one more question. Operator : Okay. Our final question today will come from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Hello, guys. Sorry, guys, just a quick one I'll add after all you said. I was asked this morning what would happen at $40 flat to all your assumptions? Thanks. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Paul, at $40, we would adjust our capital appropriately, and we would be able to generate what we believe would be the best rates of return in the industry. That's certainly a big separator for EOG. But we would adjust our spending to cash flow and stay balanced and stay disciplined and hunker down and continue to improve. We are optimistic and we have hope, and we're not there yet, but at one day, we would be able to get our capital efficiency to a point where we could actually grow oil at $40, and we're working towards that goal. We're not there quite at the moment, but we're going to continue to focus on that. But our focus, of course, first, has always been on returns and capital discipline and keeping the company healthy in that regard. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : I've got the feeling it's just a couple of minutes and it's a long question, but could I just follow up? Could you walk us through the progression from the field level returns that you talked about after tax to the corporate level returns? I don't think anyone has asked that one, which is always a conundrum as it regards to U.S. E&P. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, I did talk about that a little bit earlier. But we did put the benchmark of 30% rate of return on the direct side, which is the well cost only. We set that at that mark so that we would have room that when we put in full cost, that would be land and seismic and infrastructure, our capital rate of return, not ROCE or ROE, but our capital investment rates of return would be about 15%. Now that walks down \u2013 it's a long process, but that walks down to ROE and ROCE. But the ROE and ROCE are trailing metrics. And it takes years to get your base production to the point where it reflects the returns that you're currently drilling. So it's a long process; it takes several years to get there. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : It's the top of the hour, I'll leave it there. Thank you. Operator : And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Bill Thomas for any additional or closing remarks. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, I'm going to ask Gary Thomas to add some remarks on our progress on cost reduction and where we see that headed. Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer : It goes along with the last question there, and also, yes, us being competitive on the world market as it requires that we really be disciplined in spending and that we just continue to work our costs down. And that is, yes, through just all the primary efficiencies we've mentioned earlier with us having the top rigs. And you'll note too that we had quite a number of our rigs in 2016 under contracts placed a couple years ago, higher rates, $26,000 and $27,000 a rig. Now those are rolling off, and we're going to be able to replace those, about half those rigs with rates that are in the $13,000 to $15,000 per day rate. So that allows drilling costs to be down about 20% \u2013 25%. Our tubulars, we depleted their inventory here early 2017. And with the arrangements we have in place, that will allow those costs to go down in the 20% to 25%. With our sand, as I mentioned earlier, we've reduced our production costs, optimized the transportation, just all of those sorts of things that allow us to reduce sand cost by about 15%. Same with rigs, we had many of our frac fleets under long-term contract. Half those are going away, which will allow us then to bring in the lower frac rates. We've continued to improve completion efficiency with faster completions, wireline run times, just our stage arrangements. The water infrastructure has continued to be enhanced, and it allows us to reduce our water costs. Our wellhead inventory, it's somewhat depleted, and that will allow us to reduce those costs in the 25% range. So all of this, and that probably accounts to 50% to 60% of our well cost, allows us to further reduce well cost here going into 2017. Yes, we are s pleased with the vendor help, service providers. We've got the top rigs, the top frac equipment. It's a fast-changing technology, so we're glad not to have ownership but just to work and partner with these service providers to have outstanding service at competitive prices. They're not always the same providers, but they're the best and the most cost effective in our arena. And the other thing is that our rig efficiency has improved such that, yes, we will not have to have the number of rigs we had back in 2013 and 2015. As a matter of fact, when we look at our 10% growth and our 20% growth, we think we'll be able to provide this sort of growth running somewhere between 25 rigs to 35 rigs. The number of frac plates we'll then require with the efficiency we're seeing are going to be in the 15 to 20 frac plates running for us, and that's on a compound average growth or increased rates. By the time we get to 2020, we're talking, yes, that's the 35 rigs on the 20% growth. So yes, the downturn has allowed EOG just to enhance our overall operations. Our divisions are performing especially well, continuing to lower our costs. And during the ramp up we would expect the same because if we look back and see what has been done by EOG in the period that we were growing volumes, the 30% to 40%, we will continue lowering our well cost, improving our efficiencies. And we expect our divisions to continue to do the same, especially with all the ideas we have now for further reduction. Thank you, Bill. William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'd like to end this conference by saying thank you to all of the EOG team. The EOG employees are focused on returns and they're performing at an extremely high level, and we could not be more proud of each one of them. So we look forward to the days ahead. So thank you for listening and thank you for your support. Operator : Thank you very much. That does conclude our conference for today. I'd like to thank everyone for your participation.",

LLC Charles Meade - Johnson Rice Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Operator : Good day everyone and welcome to the EOG Resources 2016 Third Quarter Conference Call. At this time for opening remarks and introduction I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG resources Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead sir. Timothy Driggers : Thank you. Good morning and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing the third quarter 2016 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward looking statements. The risk associated with the forward looking statements have been outline in the press release and EOGs SEC filings and they incorporate those by reference of this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filing with the SEC to disclose not only crude reserves but also probably reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in the quarter not contemplated by the SECs reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website. In addition for the purpose of this call the reserve estimates for basin and low level resources are net after resources unless otherwise states. In reference to well location, wells drilled and wells completed are after EOGs interest unless otherwise stated. Participating on the call this morning are : Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Gary Thomas, President and Chief Operating Officer; Billy Helms, EVP, Exploration and Production; David Trice, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, VP, Marketing Operations; and Cedric Burgher, Senior VP, Investor and Public Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening, and we included guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2016 in yesterday's press release. This morning we'll discuss topics in the following order. Bill Thomas will review our shift to premium drilling and the updated 2020 growth outlook. Billy Helms will provide an update to our premium Delaware Basin resource and David Trice will discuss notable achievements in the other select plays. Gary Thomas will go over our operational accomplishments and I will discuss EOG's financials, capital structure. And Bill will provide concluding remarks. Here's Bill Thomas. William Thomas : Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. EOG has responded to the downturn at oil process with an unrelenting focus on capital turns. In 2016 we increased well productivity and lowered well and operating cost at a record pace. The company projects an all-in return on the 26 capital program on the company record and we achieved this on the lowest commodity price environment that we have experienced in a long time. Our tremendous success in proving capital return this year and combined with the addition of the Yates acreage has also increased the company resource potential in both size and quality at a record pace. As a result we reset the company to deliver high return oil growth with in-cash well with $50 oil environment. We believe this is unique to the industry. In this price environment our ability to generate high capital rates of return and achieve strong double digit growth with the balance CapEx that cash flow program sets the industry apart, leader in capital efficiency. In early 2016 the town working each player across identified 3200 locations representing 2 billion barrels of oil reserve potential. That meant a new rate of return standard we designated premium. To meet the premium standards a well has to earn a minimum of 30% direct after tax rate returns at $40 oil. The process at first refining premium and second identifying the inventory will ensure that during 2016 year 2 we did not spend a single dollar during the un-economic wells. We did anticipate about the new premiums standard is the fire it would light under each as a team working EOGs play across the company. Since it is all of 2016 we have converted more than 1000 additional locations to premium on our existing acreage. The Yates merger added another 1700 premium locations. A premium resource potential now totaled more than $5 billion barrels of oil equipment in 6000 locations, that's more than double the resource potential and almost double the locations from the start of 2016. More impressively when you do that math on those numbers you see that net reserves for oil for our premium inventory went from 625 MBOE to 860 MBOE to-date. We are not only adding more premium inventory, the productivity of that inventory is growing. Another important factor in improving capital efficiency is 29% reduction in cash operating unit cost and over $1 billion annual operating savings compared to 2014. For the third quarter in a row we have lowered our operating expense forecast for the year. On the last number of years EOG has consistently added locations faster than we grab them. Over the next number of years we fully expect to do the same with our premium locations. We stated at the beginning of the year that EOG shift to premium was permanent. Our performance this year should leave little doubt of EOGs ability to execute that shift. Before I hand it over to Bill Helms to review the Delaware Basin, I wanted to discuss the other big news from the press release last night. Our updated 2020 outlook. We introduced 2017 through 2020 outlook last quarter at 10% compounded annual growth rate at $50 oil, increasing to 20% at $60 oil. We provided this long-term framework for the reasons I just mentioned. Our premium inventory is growing in size and quality and we expect to replace it faster than we grow it. With continued capital efficiency gains we are increasing our 2017 through 2020 PAGR outlook by 5%. At $50 to $60 we are now capable of growing a compounded at 15% annually. Given the size of our base production today, stack growth is remarkable. Also remarkable is the leak in the river that growth and in the dividend with the cash flow. It's important to note that our 2020 outlook includes growth throughout our large high quality diversified portfolio of place. As discussed in the opening remarks our organization structure and cutting edge culture are driving new technology advancements, cost reductions and exploration efforts across the company at a record pace. Our 2020 outlook envisions high return in growth from the Eagle Ford, Rockies, Bakken and Permian. Additionally we continue to work on other emerging exploration exploits and expect they will become a material part of our future. EOG is a resilient company. Our unique culture continues to produce sustainable gains and capital productivity and generate years of high quality drilling potential. We are leaders in capturing high quality acreage in the best oil plains in the US. And the Yates transaction is just the latest example of EOGs ability to add highly turned growth potential. Now I will turn it over to Billie Helms to update the Delaware Basin results. Lloyd Helms : Thanks, Bill. 2016 is turning out to be a tremendous year for EOG in the Delaware Basin. Secondly highlighted in a couple of ways. First, our Permian teams progress delivering increased well performance and cost reduction has been outstanding. As illustrated on Slide 11, EOG continues to deliver exceptional industry leading well productivity. This outperformance was accomplished in multiple ways which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. Second, with the combination of technology gains, cost reduction and the Yates transaction we increased the Delaware Basin's resource by 155% bringing the new total to a massive $6 billion barrels of oil equivalent from 6300 net drilling locations. The increase is 3.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent larger than our total announced just one year ago on the third quarter call. Now that the resource potential has been further defined, our efforts will focus on converting the identified locations to premium, approximately 55% of the 6300 locations are currently premium and we are confident that the majority of the non-premium locations will be converted overtime. There are two ways to convert the inventory. One is by increasing oil productivity through technology since it is our precision targeting process and improved completion techniques. Two is through lowering costs, both capital costs as well as operating expenses. It is like the Eagle Ford, we are confident that our premium inventory in the Delaware Basin will continue to increase overtime. As we have discussed in the past the Delaware Basin was a large very complex geological basin. Our first step entering any play is to focus our exploration team on understanding the details of the rock characteristics. And then acquire our acreage position in areas that exhibit high quality rock potential. Majority of the acreage required in the Yates transaction demonstrates strong geologic characteristics and compliments EOGs existing acreage position. The added acreage inventory will allow us to trade blocked up acreage to provide optional use of longer laterals and more efficient use of infrastructure. Blocking up acreage will overtime continue to drive down operating costs and convert the existing inventories to premium status. Most of the acreage resource estimate is from the Wolfcamp. Our new estimate of total resource potential is 2.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. This represents 123% increase to the previous estimate of 1.3 billion barrels. The elementary increase about 530 net locations but more impressively the average laterally increased by 60% over 7000 feet. We are steadily increasing the length of our laterals but more importantly maintaining our focus on targeting and completion to not diminish the productivity preferred of lateral. We have previously sub-divided the Wolfcamp into an oil-window where the production is more than 50% oil and a combo play where the production is a balanced mix of oil, natural gas and NGLs. In addition, we have tested multiple target intervals within each sub; the resource estimate uses a confirmed test results from the different tested intervals in both the oil window and the combo play but in general can be summarized as including one productive interval across our acreage with well spacing averaging 660 feet between oil windows and 880 feet between wells in the combo play. A few highlights in the third quarter are from two 660 foot spacing patterns. One with two wells and the other with 4 wells both in the upper wolf can. The two well pattern has an average 30 day production over 30,000 BOEs per day with 2100 barrels of oil per day per well. Both were drilled using shore laterals averaging 4500 feet. The 4 well pattern had average 30 day production over 2800 BOEs per day with 1900 barrels of oil per day per well. These wells were drilled using about 4900 foot laterals. Somewhere to our other resource plays, we continue to test tighter spacing and evaluate the optimal development plan for each area. In the second bound springs we upgraded our resource potential estimate from 500 million barrels of oil equivalent to 1.4 billion barrels. Another massive increase that is almost 3 times our estimate from the year ago. The Yates acreage added about half the increase with the remainder due to targeting and technology driving tremendous efficiencies. While the lendered, also known as the Avalon, is the most material of our Delaware Basin plays. We have had minimal activity in 2016, based on longer term production components and a detailed assessment of drilling locations we now estimate that the Leonard resource potential is 1.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent as compared to our previous estimate of 550 million barrels. Finally we did not expect to convert the majority, we not only expect to convert the majority 6300 locations to premium, we anticipate discovering new sources of premium drilling as we test additional areas and we find new target intervals within this geologically complex basin. We are still in the early innings of the Delaware Basin and we are excited about the future. EOGs Delaware Basin potential is rapidly improving in both sides and productivity and adds to EOGs portfolio of US unconditional assets and unique growth story. Here's David Trice. David Trice : Thanks, Billy. In Eagle Ford we continue to make tremendous progress in costs. In the third quarter we drilled and completed 47 wells or remarkable $4.6 million per well. Well costs are being driven lower for all he reasons we mentioned in our last call. More efficient rate of operations are driving drilling days down to less than 6 days a well. Completions are also getting more efficient. In 2014 we were 600 feet of lateral per day. During this downturn, we have taken a harder look at completion operations and logistics and are now completing wells 66% faster at almost a 1000 feet per day. At the same time we continue to enhance the effectiveness of our completion as shown on Slide 28. Additionally Eagle Ford well performance continues to grow even as we push well closer together. During the third quarter we completed a set of 5 interim wells down spaced to 200 feet that were some of our best performing wells for the quarter. Core unit 10H through 14H averaged over 2000 barrels of oil per day per well for the first 30 days of production. We have been drilling the Eagle Ford for seven years and we still have so much to learn in this world class pay. Also in the Eagle Ford our enhanced oil coverage or EOR is progressing on schedule. We completed on schedule the initial phase of the 32 well pilot, our largest to date. We look forward to having results with you sometime in 2017. In the Rockies we continue to get excellent results from the firm sand in the bottom of the Basin. Our drilling program there is delivering consistent premium level returns and we are looking forward to expanding actively there next year. The 9 wells we drilled in the third quarter are producing on average almost 1600 BOEs per day for the first 30 days were drilled in under 6 days and have a total well cost of just $4.9 million normalized to a 6500 foot lateral. In addition the decline rates were relatively low, on average the wells produced almost a 100,000 BOEs per well in 90 days. The average lateral length in the third quarter was short at just 4100 feet. We expect to move to wander to 2 mile wells particularly now that the Yates transaction blocked as much of our existing acreage in the sweet part of the play. Longer laterals were planned economics similar to what we have realized in other play and is particularly helpful with respect to surface permitting efficiencies in the powder of the basins. Precision targeting has allowed us to convert the turner into a premium play. We used advanced techniques to identify to identify math and steer our wells in the narrow 15 foot window. We were able to accomplish this even while we continue to push the envelope on drilling speed. We plan to complete a total 25 net wells in the turn this year. Here's Gary Thomas. Gary Thomas : Thanks, David. EOGs operational performance in 2016 in terms of cost and efficiency gains has been one of the best in company history. In addition to making huge improvements in well productivity, we have driven so much cost and time out of our operations that we significantly increase the number of wells we are drilling into completing. EOG will now drill approximately 90 more wells and complete 80 more wells than were originally forecast for 2016. While only increasing our development capital by $200 million. As a result our fourth quarter domestic oil production before the addition of the Yates is forecast to be 36,000 barrels of oil per day above our forecast at the start of the year. That's an amazing accomplishment and the testament is the tremendous capital efficiency gains we have made this year. When we had Yates in international volume we expect the EOGs all exit rates will be near the company's all time high set in the fourth quarter of 2014. Now let's talk about cost reduction and efficiency gains. In 2014 EOGs drilling days and total well cost in our large, 80 Bakken [ph], in working place are down 25% to 45%. Another measure of a drilling efficiency is number of wells drilled per rig per year which increased 40% in our top three place. For example, we are drilling 32 wells per rig year. On operating side we reduced cash in cost 29% and 2016 LOE alone has come down almost a $0.5 billion compared to 2014. While the major driver of cost reduction has been efficiency gains we are also benefitting from approximately half of our high-cost drilling and completion contract being replaced by rates that are 40% lower. In addition, tubular and well head cost will come down 25% with our 2017 arrangements. The market is speculating about service costs increases and how they will impact the industry. For EOG due to our integrated operations, current arrangements and continued efficiency gains we are well insulated. At a minimum we expect at least the well cost lap in 2017. Our teams continue to make significant efficiency gains. EOGs rate of return culture and large scale sweet spot positions in the best North American reserve place but still it takes continual improvement across all categories. And now for a word on ducks. Our cost leading and additional $200 million of capital will allow EOG to complete almost all of the debts we had in the inventory in the beginning of the year. The rate of return on additional capital is very strong and as I noted earlier it allows us to exit the year with oil production on an upswing near record rates and will get EOG off to a great start of 2017. We will end 2016 with approximately 140 un-completed wells, a normal level of working inventory. EOG thrives during downturns, due to our strength as a low cost operators. Our strategy of low debt, living within cash flow and focusing on returns has allowed us to be one of the few companies to preserve a balance without diluting our shareholders by raising equity to pay down debt. Furthermore, we are in the best cost and inventory position I have seen in my 40 years with the company. Our 2020 outlook is testament to that. We have accomplished this through our premier shift to premium drilling and a wide spread focus on cost control. For me whether extensive inventory or premium locations however, CLO most proud of the highly integrated efforts of our teams to deliver sustainable cost reduction. They have done an outstanding job. We're committed to maintain this focus and we are uniquely positioned for the future. Here's to Tim Driggers. Timothy Driggers : Thanks Gary, Capitalized interest for 2016 was $8 million. Exploration and development expenditures were $660 million excluding property acquisitions which was 32% less as compared to third quarter 2015 while our production volumes decreased by just 3%. In addition expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $16 million. We are increasing full year capital expenditure guidance from $2.6 million to $2.8 million. At the end of September, 2016 total debt outstanding was $7 billion and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 37%. At September 30 we had more than $1 billion of cash at hand leaving us non-GAAP net debt of $5.9 billion or net debt to total cap ratio of 33%. Year-to-date we have sold assets generating approximately $625 million of proceeds and associated production of 80 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. 3400 barrels of oil a day and 4290 barrels per day of NGLs. Assets sold include midland basin, Colorado DJ Basin and Hanesfield properties. The effective tax-rate for the third quarter was 30% and the deferred tax-ratio was 132%. Now I will turn it back over to Bill. William Thomas : Thanks, Tim. Our micro view has not changed. Over the long-term we believe oil in the 40s will not sustain enough production to meet demand worldwide. While EOG can deliver strong oil growth within cash flow with $50 oil, we believe that US industry as a whole needs to sustain $60 oil prices and extended lead time to provide a moderate level of growth. Worldwide Base decline rates are slowly reducing supply and consensus view is the current large inventory overhang could return to normal levels by late 2017. We plan to issue official guidance in 2017 along with our year end results early next year. Our overarching goal in 2017 is to build momentum of the foundation of premium inventory EOG has established in 2016 as Gary explained we are completing 180 more wells than previously forecasted so we are exiting 2016 with strong oil production and we will complete a higher percentage of premium wells in 2017 versus 2016. After two years of this down cycle we are more than ready to resume high return oil growth. EOGs vision for 2017 to 2020 can be summed up with four goals; be the leader and return on capital employed. Be the US leader in oil growth, be one of the lowest cost producers in global oil market and remain committed to safety and the environment. EOGs long-term forecast has not wavered during the downturn. Our purpose is to create significant long-term shareholder value. And as we enter our recovery our unique and resilient culture has positioned the company to achieve strong results for years to come. Thank you for listening. Now we will go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Scott Reynolds from RBC Capital Markets. Scott Reynolds : Good morning. William Thomas : Good morning. Scott Reynolds : Impressive job this quarter and congratulations on the increased outlook. If you step back and look at the big opportunity, we all have the premium that you described. Can you give us a sense on generally how are you looking at developing that, in terms of what formations may be high on the top of the list over the next couple of years. And how do you see pad development going forward in that play. Billy Helms : Yes, Scott, the is Lloyd W. Helms. So on the Delaware we do expect with this increase there our activity over time will continue to increase. Especially going into next year. And our actively today has been focused largely on the Wolfcamp, I think that will stay of the majority the focus will stay on the Wolfcamp. Just to reiterate all three plays are considered premium today and we're excited about the potential. We're further along in our development at the Wolfcamp. And so, for that reason will continue that it\u2019s next an excellent volume growth generator, extremely high rate return play. And what really need first, it also allows us to take a look at, this shallower objectives as we drove around through those, that gives us a better idea of long-term potential and how the drilling program in those place will develop. And in the future. In the second part your question there about pad, drilling, we are continuing to develop pads that are drilling, as we develop the field now. And that will continue as we add the shallower zones as well. The good thing about that is we putt in the infrastructure once, for all those wells to share, in the future. So I incrementally - of return for those programs in the future will continue to increase. As we share that infrastructure, that's no doubt for the initial completions. Scott Reynolds : Great, that's good and then in my follow up. This quarter you guys are now producing more oil than - it's over 50% which was a - it was a pretty good heavy lifting here over the last few years to get there. And when you look at your long-range outlook, could you give us a sense of how some of the resource pieces contribute to that, so specifically what is the premium producing today with EOGs [ph] for producing today and in your long range outlook, where did those plays go. William Thomas : Scott, we never broke it out but - And so I think really what I think about the company is that we have a very strong diversified portfolio. And from year-to-year from actually maybe even quarter-to-quarter we shift our capital to where were we are ceding the highest rate returns. And I think changed over time. As Billy said, obviously the Delaware is giving that bigger and better for us, so it will get more capital next year than it got this year. And the EOG - will still get a lot of - lot of capital, in the Rockies play, particular the Powder River Basin will get a lot of capital. But I think, you need to be thinking of my view, very balanced, very large and very diversified portfolio. Scott Reynolds : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Subash Chandra with Guggenheim. Subash Chandra : Hi, good morning. First question is, when I think about the number of locations in the Wolfcamp. Is it two zones, that you're thinking about, in each of the oil and combo plays? And what the status of the lower Wolfcamp if you had any results there. Billy Helms : Yes Subash, this is Billy Helms again, So when the Wolfcamp we generally think about yes two, mainly two, we have two zones, the upper middle is what we assess resource potential too. But within each one, there are multiple target intervals. So you can think about is having multiple targets with each play and we assess the potential mainly and in areas where we tested each one, and we've based that on our confirm test, comparing results of each one. That's how we've kind of rolled up the resource potential there. I'm sorry. What was second part of your question? Yes, the lower Wolfcamp. So you have a lower Wolfcamp we have had some test, I'd say the majority of our test so far have been in the upper part of the zone. But we have said some testing what we call the middle of camp. And those results are encouraging as well. Subash Chandra : Okay. So if I hear you correctly, it's a very highly risk [ph] measure your locations that you published to-date but if I just did not resource map across multiple levels I can get many more locations and what you publish. Billy Helms : Yes, I think the way you think about that is; our results are based on our confirm test, in each one of the intervals and then we allocate that to sticks on the map kind of the approach, where we - is not just taking them - not total number breakers and dividing it by well spaces, it's actually geologically looking at where those perspectives intervals are exists, we mapped them out, pretty extensively and then place well locations on the spot to assess the potential. So, but you're right it only goes to the zones we tested and we do collect additional intervals to test going forward. Subash Chandra : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate : Thank you, good morning everybody. But I wonder if I could as you about the 22 well on Delaware this quarter. There is still the shorter wells but with well rates appear to still be - maybe I'm getting this wrong but it was but there still substantially better, than you can go longer lateral implied type. Can you help me understand what the implications are, the run rate that been on those recent locations [ph]. Billy Helms : Yes, this is Billy Helms, we are excited about the potential that we're seeing in these - in these zones more recently in there. We along the laterals are giving us a lot more efficiently, lot more reserved per well, higher production rates. And our EUR assessment for the play, though is taking what we've tested across the play. And some of those tests are a little older, so we're trying to cooperate all the test we have. And all of the wells are not benefiting from the latest results, so and - so our results continue to improve and we assess that as time goes forward, and I think the tremendous thing that we are seeing it's just the benefits from our targeting and how that's really enhancing the productivity, and that really comes from our detailed working in continual work on assessing that geological potential to play. And so, that's why we're confident, that as we continue to improve that technique, and gain more understanding that we're going to see additional intervals [ph]. That will add to the resource over time. So we fully expected the resource in the play will continue to increase. Doug Leggate : Thanks, Billy. [Indiscernible] Wolfcamp oil at 1.3 million. It was quite a while you completed in the third quarter. Timothy Driggers : No, that's exactly what I - and the wells were completed in the third quarter are including and actually year-to-date the results are still stronger than what our resource update is. So again, I think it's a testament to the technology and the things we're continued to expand on and learn. So yes, I think there is additional upside potential there. William Thomas : Yes, if I could add a little more color there. This is bill Thomas. The water [ph] quality drive the productivity all the plays and so, we're getting better and better at identifying them the better quality lock [ph] in each one these plays and they were giving considerably better at locating the lateral with a precision targeting in keeping the lateral in that good rock, for long period long part of the lateral, so there is a process for learning. We probably learn more about rock quality and targeting, and execution on that part of the process in the last year, so that we've ever wanted. So there's a lot of upsides as Billy, said and talked about which he does a lot of upside left to go in that process. Doug Leggate : My follow up is quicker; it is kind of related question. If you can achieve 15% to 25%, $50 to $60 oil. If these wells continue to get better, would you choose to raise the growth rate again or do more with less? I'm thinking about constraints on the infrastructure on things about nature [ph]. Thank you. Billy Helms : Well, there is a limit on how fast we want to go, in each one these plays. Because you don't want to go faster than a learning curve and certainly you do have to stay ahead of the infrastructure process. And we don't want to use less than the capital efficiency, we like to continue to increase the capital efficiency as we go along. But we're going to be very disciplined and are spending approach. And the rates-to-return just to say a bit about that the rate-to-return that we're getting on the premium, is that the minimum return, that means the lowest return well, in the 6,000 well inventory generates a 30% rate of return. At $40 in 2015 flat gas prices. So the returns on the average well is much, much higher than 30% of these are exceptionally strong well. Doug Leggate : Thanks for the clarification, Billy, appreciate it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio : Good morning guys, and impressive results again. Bill my first question is you got about $2 billion resource and indicated that's likely to rise over time. That is the best it has been in 40 years. So you're clearly not resource constraints, so how do you think about potential asset sales given acreage prices and given it appears like lots of BMPs [ph] are reaching a similarly conclusion at a similar time, and it's first mover advantage, what would your thoughts there. William Thomas : Evan, as we continue to generate more potential. And we continue to high grade that, if those give us a lot more opportunity for just high grading our asset portfolio good property sale. So we're going to continue that process, evaluating each asset - and fits into the future of the company. And on core assets, that are the ones that don't reach the premium category, it'll certainly be candidates for our asset sales in the future. And that will help keep balance sheet strong, and we want to operate from our spending stand point we want to operate within cash flow. But the property sale proceeds will continue to help us keep our balance sheet strong. And by increasing the quality of things we drill over time, obviously increases the returns, but we are also lowering the cost which will filter back down through the base, we will hire a company and lower the drilling rate. So it's a process of just getting better in all areas through times. Evan Calio : Great. And my second question, it's a follow up to Doug's [ph] you introduced the high or low growth guidance here 15%, 25%. I mean the entire industry from small cap to chevrons projecting an impressive rising growth targets, in largely in Texas low prices. So I mean how do you - what do you think is the limitations of growth are made for EUG or where they are levels and how are you - what differentiated the EUG execution and how are you preparing to deliver that in execute better than the industry, thanks. William Thomas : Well, I think the real advantage we have, Evan, is the rates of return that we're generating of each one of these wells, is we believe is significantly higher than industry and so that will filter down through the financials. And in due time it will show up in ROCE so our first goal as I mentioned; is to meeting the US leader in terms of [indiscernible]. And, that's a position that we historically held and I think it's a big distinguishing factor in the company. Evan Calio : And in your rating level, if you think about it maximum growth rate achievable within the organization outside of your sheet? William Thomas : Well, I don't want to speculate on that. We want to stay efficient and we want to continue to get better so as I talked about before there we want to stay discipline and under control. And so the goal is to get better not just to get there. We're going to try to tackle at from that standpoint. Evan Calio : Great, thanks guys. Operator : We'll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : Good morning, Bill, to you and the rest you're team there. I'd like to ask a question about the estimate resources assessments the Yates of transaction, I think you get pertinent information on your slides specifically Slide 9. You have the resource per well. For the Yates acquisition around 9-20 of next year, higher than what you had to give an incumbent in your portfolio. Can you talk about what the factors - what factors that product that higher per well resource reflects and it may be is that up a piece of a bigger picture that in general the rock qualities are higher as you. As you move up into Mexico whether you get deeper higher pressure perhaps longer, lateral life that driving that. Billy Helms : Yes, Charles, this is Billy Helms. So when we assess most of the Yates on the average, it was generally on the basis one-mile laterals. And we sense that we come back in and assess the potential across all the plays. And as you've noticed lateral link on the most of the across the whole portfolio, has increased to about 7,000 feet per well in the old window. And even greater in the combo window. And so, I think the allowed the initial estimate you saw their Slide 9, were based on our assessment only made the transaction. And per Yates and those were based on the essentially one mile a well. So that's the - that's the majority of the difference. Charles Meade : Okay, thanks. William Thomas : But as we move into this, the one thing that the Yates does allow us to do is to block it out with our existing acres. So we fully expect to be able to drill these longer laterals across all the portfolio. Charles Meade : Got it thank you and then, Bill I thought I could ask a question about the 15%, 25 % that you put out you touched on this I believe on the last conference call about how that - how that trajectory might shift or evolve over the 2017 to 2020 framework. Do you see that whether we're talking about that $50 low end or the $60 high end? Do you see that being back end weighted or you have a growth accelerating to that two-year timeframe, or it more likely the front end weighted. William Thomas : Charles, as you look at the slides, in the front part of the slide deck it shows in 2017 the growth rate is smaller, and it grows over time. So in 2017 it's less than 15% at $50, and into 2020 it's probably more than 15% at $50, it's a more back end weighted. Charles Meade : Got it, that's detailed look, thank you, Bill. Operator : Our next question will come from Pearce Hammond with Simmons Piper Jaffray. Pearce Hammond : Good morning and thanks to the helpful color in the release on the Delaware base. My first question Bill is on our rigs and what the rig count could look like based upon this long-term production oil production growth plan. Kind of where are you right now on rig count and I know you haven't given seventeen guidance but looking at this long-term oil production growth plan, where do you see rigs reversing to, any color you can provide on that would be helpful. Gary Thomas : This is Gary Thomas. Right now we have 15 rigs operating domestic, we got one international that being in traded at. And we as you say we have disclosed what we had planned for 2017. However, just with the rig efficiency that we've seen over the last two years and what the type rigs we have in place. We will not be required to ramp up the number rigs very much for both standing plan that we put in place. Just have a tremendous amount of flexibility. The one thing that we've 2016 most of our rigs were under long-term contracts high rates, as we mentioned Yates will have only about half that number for 2017, that we have put in place right that about 40% lower for especially the same number rigs. Pearce Hammond : Great. Within those 15 great, how are those broken out right now? Gary Thomas : Right now, we've got five in Midland that's really what we very average this year and that is that Delaware Basin, we have six now in San Antonio. So we have four in rocking mountains because we have one rig that was required on the Yates position in the Powder River Basin. And we will let it go but as we've mentioned earlier, we're going to be taken up an additional rig for the Delaware basin year end. And also for San Antonio for the Eagle. Pearce Hammond : Great. As of my follow up, after pertains to sand loading. In just curious in the Delaware basin specifically, where you on sand loadings right now, you have you reached a point of diminishing returns on sand loading or we not there yet. Gary Thomas : This is Gary Thomas. We're still experimenting near the Delaware basin, I might just take you back to the Eagle Ford operated for so many years. We found the point of diminishing returns as a matter fact here sand loading for 2016 on the average is slightly less than what it was in 2015. So we got a pretty good hand as to what we anticipate has an optimum sand loading rate there for the Delaware basin. Pearce Hammond : Can you share with that is that like an Eagle Ford, on a pallet per foot basis? Billy Helms : This is Billy Helms. Just to add a little more color on that. It will vary in each area and we've tested as much is maybe 3,000 pounds per foot which is probably not going to be applicable across all the plays, in every area, is probably an average somewhere between 2,000 to 2800 probably in that range. Down the zone and where it is but it's it'll be a broad range depending on that play and where it is in that play. Pearce Hammond : Thank you very much. William Thomas : Well, that's what we're in the process of trying as Gary, mentioned. Pearce Hammond : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer : Thank you, good morning. William Thomas : Good morning, Brian. Brian Singer : First couple questions on the Eagle Ford, can you add more color on the stacked - staggered spacing test put 200 foot spacing into context in terms of how widespread that that may be applicable, and then the total locations per unit that would represent. And how do you view well economics and you are as a given that you pin that applying some enhanced targeting and completion over a more for more than a year. David Trice : Brian, this is David Trice. On the stack stagger targeting and the spacing we've had - we've been working on that for well over a year, and we're seeing good results on that and as we noted there on the quarter, we're not seeing any degradation the areas that we're doing that. So it's not applicable over the entire position. Some places we do have a too good targets in the lower Eagle Ford. And so, we were certainly doing that there but I think over time will continue to just seeing that improves the targets in a little bit better. And we work on the on the compilations. But again, it's not applicable on all areas, because some areas are - have little just one target, so it really throughout the play we're looking at anywhere from a 200 foot spacing 3 or 350 depending on the area. Brian Singer : Got it, thanks. And then shifting over that Poweder River Basin which that seems like your employing similar strategy here as with that - you are in the premium can you talk to the potential cost savings for BOE from deploying longer laterals in the PRB. And then what type of activity do you think we can see and how prospective, do you view opportunities beyond the turners sand. David Trice : This is David, again. In the Powder River, we're still really early endings there, we've been testing very stones that were we've been focused mainly on the Turner lately, but we do see a lot of upside as far as extending these laterals like we mentioned earlier that we're seeing a big up lift on the economics, and about our rivers as we do in other places. So we do think going forward, is going to be a bigger part of the program. Brian Singer : Got it, thanks, and just in area that you mentioned exploratory the potential for further exploration and this may not count as exploration because you already have some premium locations built, but how does the Powder fall in, in terms of incremental opportunities for EOG on the trajectory. William Thomas : Well again, I think the area where we have stacked by nearly got 4,000 to 5,000 feet of potential there is similar to the Delaware Basin. But like I mentioned we are we are early we are still testing a lot of targets. And we did have a substantial acreage position there. We got 200,000 net acres really in core of the play. But really across the basin we've got to kind of more than exploration we have got more like 4,000 acres. So again not that big thing that there's potential for progression additional activity here in the Poweder [ph]. Brian Singer : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd : Thanks, and good morning. A longer term strategic question for you guys, how do you - how do you think about the potential to generate free cash flow prior to the collapsing crude we seen you reach a point where all you cash return for shareholders became slightly more meaningful component of shareholder return as reflected by some pretty substantial increases to the dividend. When you look out over the next few years. Do you vision dividend growth becoming more meaningful again are the outlook for growth change enough that we should expect all incremental cash flow going to drilling for the foreseeable future. William Thomas : Ryan, the dividend certainly very important to us. And as the business environment improves, and process improves we'll start considering increasing the dividend again, and then certainly generating free cash flow as we go. I think we want to begin to do, we generate just a slight amount in the fourth quarter. So that's a goal that we want to continue to focus on as we go forward. So free cash flow and dividend growth will be a part of game plan. As the business environment improves. Ryan Todd : Okay. Thank you. Then maybe one just as we think about the infrastructure, I know you talked about a little bit, any constraints in the permanent infrastructure side. In terms of kind of [indiscernible] through what we should expect to spend on like its 15% of the capital budget a reasonable amount or anything the ballpark how much what your needs are going to be as you ramp over the next three or four years. Gary Thomas : Ryan, this is Gary Thomas. Just to address you on the infrastructure spending for next year, it will be a very similar to what we've had the last several years. We want to stay up a little bit a head and they'll be in that 18% to 20% of our capital. Will let - address our position on infrastructure there William Thomas : Yes, Hi Ryan, good morning. The thing is we have done a great job on gas take away and when you think about the expenses gas gathering and we're going to have multiple market connections in the area, so we plan on exiting this year with over $300 million today of strong, so when we think about that coupled with our NGL transportation of vaccination capacity, we really don't see any constraints on the gas at all. And then also maybe just to add on oil too, we're actually finalizing agreements renewable terminal that's going to be all the - service and late 2017. The work that will have all the market diversification whether that's the Gulf coast - and also just continuing to align ourselves with our strategic providing partner. So, we wouldn't be more excited about the development, to say nothing have occurred. Ryan Todd : Okay, thanks. Operator : And that does conclude our Q&A session, I would now like to turn the call back over to Mister Thomas for any additional or closing remark. William Thomas : In closing, I want to say thank you to all the tremendous EOG employees were making the record setting accomplishments went down this year of reality. Everyone listening, do you not think EOG is maxed out, we are willing to improve, and we've seen modeled on the trade opportunities ahead of us and we look forward to 2017 and beyond. So thank you for listening and thank you for your support. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call, thank you all for your participation you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead. Timothy K. Driggers - EOG Resources, Inc.: Good morning and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website. Participating on the call this morning are : Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Gary Thomas, President and Chief Operating Officer; Billy Helms, EVP, Exploration and Production; David Trice, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing Operations; and Cedric Burgher, Senior VP, Investor and Public Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening, and we included guidance for the first quarter and full year 2017 in yesterday's press release. This morning we'll discuss topics in the following order. Bill Thomas will review 2016 highlights and our 2017 capital plan. Gary Thomas, Billy Helms, and David Trice will review operational results and year-end reserve replacement data. Then, I will discuss EOG's financials and capital structure, and Bill will provide concluding remarks. Here's Bill Thomas. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Tim. As we look back, 2016 will be remembered as truly historic for EOG because it's the year we permanently shifted to premium drilling and reset the company to be successful in a lower commodity price environment. To remind everyone, our premium well is one that earns a minimum of 30% after-tax rate of return with flat $40 oil and $2.50 gas prices on a direct basis. We set the minimum at 30% to ensure that fully loaded well returns are accretive to corporate returns. I want to emphasize that this shift to premium is permanent, which means that the return hurdle and the inventory of premium wells did not change with improving oil prices. Going forward, EOG's capital will be focused on wells that are profitable at $40, meaning with modest increases to oil price, our returns have the potential to soar. You can see this on slide 24 of our investor presentation. Our list of accomplishments in 2016 include a few company records and first-time achievements. In 2016, we achieved one of the highest returns on capital expenditures in company history, and we did it at the low point of the commodity price cycle. Our shift to premium drilling and improvements in operating costs resulted in record low finding cost of $5.22 per BOE when you exclude revisions due to commodity price. Over the course of the year, we increased our premium drilling inventory nearly 9% to 6,000 locations and over 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The company added 3.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent of new drilling potential in the Delaware Basin. Since the downturn began in late 2014, we slashed unit operating costs by 22%. As a result of drilling low-cost premium wells, the company grew oil production within cash flow during the second half of 2016. We announced the world's first technically successful enhanced oil recovery in shale that delivers strong project economics. EOG completed the largest transaction in the company's history with the Yates Petroleum acquisition. Finally, we accomplished all this while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and posting the best safety record in the company's history. To sum up 2016, record setting capital efficiency gains and a significantly larger and improved drilling inventory have reset the company to achieve outstanding results in the years to come. This is why we are confident that we'll be one of the lowest cost producers and competitive in the global oil market. Now looking ahead to 2017, we're more excited than ever to resume our leadership in high-return oil growth. Transforming EOG into a premium-only driller means we expect to deliver 18% oil growth within cash flow during 2017. Remarkably, EOG can deliver strong 18% oil growth plus the dividend within cash flow if prices were to average $50 oil and $3 gas. We believe this is unique in the industry and sets EOG apart as the most capital efficient operator in the U.S. Furthermore, each of EOG's major basins will be contributing to that growth in 2017, the Eagle Ford, the Delaware Basin, the Bakken, the Powder River Basin, and the DJ Basin. That's a testament to our diverse portfolio of high-return assets. Our plan was finalized last month when strip prices were closer to $55 oil and $3.50 natural gas. If current prices hold, we will reach our goal of generating free cash flow. Our number one priority for that cash is to reinvest into high-return premium drilling. We also want to continue firming up the balance sheet with non-core asset sales. And if the business environment continues to improve, we will want to refocus on our commitment to the dividend. Looking beyond 2017, I want to talk about EOG's return prospects, specifically return on capital employed [ROCE]. If a company is earning the well-level returns we and many of our peers assert, we should eventually see those results reflected in ROCE. For EOG specifically, we expect returns and finding costs to continue to improve in the years ahead as premium wells become a higher percentage of total well completions. As new premium wells are drilled, their DD&A rate will converge towards premium finding costs. The lower DD&A rate along with lower cash operating costs such as LOE [Lease Operating Expense] and transportation should significantly improve EOG's ROCE over time. With our shift to premium drilling, our goal is to generate ROCE that exceeds our historical average of 13%. We believe this performance will make us competitive not only among our peers, but with other industries outside the energy sector. ROCE has been a very important performance metric at EOG and remains a top priority in our long-term vision. EOG is rate-of-return driven. Returns are the number one criteria for incentive compensation, and it drives capital allocation within the company. We believe EOG's best days for ROCE still lie ahead of us. Up next to provide details on our operational performance in 2016 and review the 2017 game plan is Gary Thomas. Gary L. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Bill. The 2016 accomplishments I'm most proud of are the capital efficiency gains from cost control and operational efficiencies. At the start of 2016, our plan was to drill 200 and complete 270 net wells within cash flow for $2.5 billion. By year end, due to our astonishing progress on cost control and efficiency gains, we drilled 280 and completed 445 net wells for $2.7 billion, all within cash flow. That's a 40% and 65% increase in drilling and completing activity with only an 8% increase in capital compared to our initial guidance. Almost 60% of these completed wells were drilled but uncompleted wells, so we are beginning 2017 with our normal inventory of 137 DUCs. Furthermore, our fourth quarter average oil rate of 312,000 barrels of oil per day set an all-time high from our previous record set in the fourth quarter of 2014. Here are a few highlights from our 2016 operational accomplishments. We expanded electrical power and gas lift infrastructure in South Texas and the Delaware Basin. We also expanded our water handling infrastructure in the Delaware Basin and Rockies to better reuse and more efficiently transport drilling, completion, and production water, which will reduce transportation and disposal costs. We extended our in-house chemical program and other cost-cutting practices to the Yates properties, and we continue to see significant cost reduction opportunities. For 2017, we have line of sight into sources of savings to further improve on cost control initiatives from 2016 in spite of potential service cost increases. Four significant sources of service cost savings in 2017 are : our average daily rig rates are down 25% compared to last year. Fourteen of our drilling rigs or 60% of the total are under long-term contracts, and nine of these rigs are at bottom-of-market rates. We've locked in three-quarters of our casing needs at prices 30% below our 2016 costs. To further control cost, we've also locked in 50% of our frac fleets. And we have diverse sources of frac sand, and our aggregate sand costs are expected to decrease by 18% year over year. Furthermore, I'm confident we'll be able to further improve operational efficiencies in 2017. During the downturn, we took the opportunity to upgrade our rig fleet to one of the most modern and highly efficient fleets in the industry. We are drilling 20% longer laterals and increasing the use of multi-well pads. Our expanded water infrastructure systems are expected to reduce our well cost by another $100,000 per well. And because of the combination of operational efficiencies, we expect to complete 15% more wells per frac fleet this year. We expect 2017 can be another great year for improvements for EOG's capital efficiency, maintaining our position as the low-cost, high-return leader in the E&P industry. I'll turn the call over to Billy Helms, who will update you on our Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin plays. Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Gary. The Eagle Ford has seen consistent year-over-year improvements in both production performance and operational efficiencies that have been the hallmark of EOG's advancements in horizontal technology. We continue to test multiple targets and spacing patterns to determine the optimal development pattern for each area of the field. The wells completed in 2016 as a group are outperforming wells from previous years, largely as a result of the precision targeting and advanced completion designs. During 2016, 210-day cumulative production improved 13% for wells drilled in our western acreage, while wells drilled in the east improved 10%. We also reduced completed well cost by $1 million to $4.7 million, and believe further reductions are possible in 2017. I'll leave you with one final important note about this play. There's still a tremendous amount of upward potential in the Eagle Ford. To date, we have drilled less than one-third of the total identified locations in this world-class play. The efforts to update the total resource potential are underway and can only be assessed with longer-term performance from each of the various targets and spacing tests. Our technical team continues to integrate the latest results into our future plans to assess the full potential of this asset. Suffice it to say it continues to grow. Eagle Ford oil production is expected to grow during 2017 while drilling less than half the number of wells we did during the peak of activity in 2014. Using our 2017 rate of approximately 195 net completed wells, we have over 20 years of inventory. The Eagle Ford has been and will continue to be a growth asset for the company. Last year we announced early success in the first enhanced oil recovery project in horizontal shale. In 2015, we tested four pilots, comprised of 15 wells across a geologically diverse area, and the results were consistently positive and highly economic. In 2016, we initiated a larger 32-well pilot to test how well EOR technology can be implemented on a larger manufacturing type scale. The pilot has been a success and confirms our initial results for field-scale implementation. As with the 2015 pilots, the 32-well project delivered premium economics with a finding cost of less than $6 per barrel. This 32-well project provided insights into EOR's impact across a wide variety of completion styles and spacing patterns. The results were favorable for wells completed from 2011 through 2016, with well spacing ranging from 200 feet to 500 feet. This gives us further confidence of the applicability of EOR across major areas of the field. And in addition, our technical understanding of this first in the world EOR process is increasing. The 300,000 barrels of net oil production from EOR in 2016 was within 5% of our forecast, further validating the consistency of the results observed in the four pilots prior to 2016. This data supports our previous estimates that the incremental recovery due to EOR is adding 30% to 70% more oil to our primary recovery estimates. In 2017, we are eager to expand our EOR project by testing approximately 100 additional wells in six different areas. The result of this program will provide additional data on EOR's uplift to the Eagle Ford's resource potential and EOR's effect on field production decline. This data will help determine how we will incorporate EOR into our long-term Eagle Ford capital program. 2016 was a breakout year for the Delaware Basin, setting up this play to be our fastest growing asset in 2017. First, EOG completed some of the industry's best wells in the Permian Basin through the application of our leading-edge technology, including precision targeting and high-density completions. This technology has proven to deliver step change in well performance. And with an improved wellbore design, we began testing longer laterals in the second half of the year, with promising recovery results on a per foot basis. Our goal is to achieve the same recovery measured by EUR per foot of lateral as we increased lateral length. In 2017, we expect to use longer laterals on a larger percentage of our program, so we're excited to watch the well performance continue to improve. Second, the Yates transaction was truly transformative. The acreage obtained in the Delaware Basin is not only adjacent to our existing program, but it's also generating highly economic results. Our technical capabilities combined with this transformative transaction resulted in adding a record-setting 3.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent of estimated resource potential last year alone. In addition, we've already identified almost 3,500 premium oil locations across three targets in the Delaware, the Wolfcamp, the Second Bone Springs, and the Leonard. This is almost a mile of stacked pay in this world-class basin, and our exploration efforts are just getting started. And third, we are well positioned on infrastructure. Over the last few years we've made strategic investments in oil and gas gathering and takeaway, gas processing, water sourcing and handling, and sand rail car unloading facilities. As an example, the water sourcing and handling infrastructure is helping to reduce both our initial well cost as well as reducing our long-term cash operating cost. Some of the assets obtained in the Yates transaction included water gathering systems that support our existing systems. In our major areas of activity, we will deliver a significant percentage of our produced water into these systems. We're also increasing the volume of recycled water for use in our operations. These examples along with other cost initiatives have rendered the lease operating expense in the Delaware Basin to be among the lowest in the company. We believe these investments will provide us a competitive advantage now and in the future as we grow in the Delaware Basin. The Delaware Basin Wolfcamp is arguably the most prolific tight oil play in North America, and EOG consistently delivers the best Wolfcamp results in the industry. Please see slide 9 of our investor presentation for a plot of our 2016 well performance versus the industry. In 2017, the Wolfcamp will again be the primary focus of our drilling program, as we plan to complete 110 net wells. Here's David Trice to review the progress we've made in the Austin Chalk and our Rockies, Bakken, and international activity. David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Billy. Last year, our Eagle Ford team took a fresh look at the Austin Chalk and discovered that within our current Eagle Ford footprint, there are areas where the Austin Chalk is prospective. Using proprietary petrophysical analysis, we can identify and map the best reservoir properties using our existing well controls. We are then able to target the best rock with horizontal laterals and apply EOG-style high-density completions. The result is consistent premium Austin Chalk wells. These wells can be very prolific. And in fact, some of the best wells drilled by the company last year were in the Austin Chalk. In 2016. we completed 14 Austin Chalk wells with an average 30-day rate of 1,700 barrels of oil per day and total equivalent rate of 2,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day from an average lateral of 4,400 feet. We continue to drill delineation and spacing tests, analyze subsurface data, and create detailed mapping throughout the field to understand the prospectivity of the Austin Chalk across our South Texas position. During 2017, we'll drill approximately 25 net wells in the Austin Chalk. Those well results along with the work we did last year should get us closer to providing a resource estimate for this emerging play. In the Rockies, we had great success in the Powder River Basin and Wyoming DJ Basin during 2016. In the Powder River Basin, we focused predominantly on the Turner interval in 2016. Turner wells compete with the best inventory in the company. Our 2016 drilling program in this play averaged over 1,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day rate-restricted for the first 30 days and cost about $5 million to drill and complete. During the fourth quarter, we returned to the Parkman interval and applied our latest techniques with excellent premium-level results. Three Parkman wells had a 30-day rate that averaged 2,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. With the addition of the Yates acreage, our core position in the Powder River Basin has grown to 400,000 acres. We are expanding this program in 2017 to complete 30 net wells. And we look forward to blocking up acreage, applying longer laterals, adding to our premium inventory, and exploring the 4,800 feet of stacked pay. In the DJ Basin, we added 200 premium Codell wells through sustainable cost reductions and precision targeting during 2016. We also completed installation of water and gas infrastructure that should further reduce cost and enhance returns as we increase our development in 2017. We plan to complete approximately 15 net wells in the DJ Basin Codell this year. The Bakken is another area we've been investing in water takeaway infrastructure that should further reduce costs to support and enhance returns of our ongoing drilling program. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed a majority of the remaining pre-2016 DUCs. As a result, our 2017 drilling program will be focused on drilling premium Bakken core and Antelope Extension inventory. We expect to complete 35 net wells during 2017. In Trinidad, we continue to get great results from existing wells, which led to outperformance versus forecast in 2016. Production in Trinidad was virtually flat despite drilling just one additional well that came online in December of 2016. In 2017, we expect to drill an additional five net wells throughout the year. Here's Billy to review our year-end reserve replacement and finding costs. Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, David. We replaced 163% of our 2016 production at a very low finding cost of $5.22 per BOE, excluding revisions due to commodity price changes. That's less than half of our 2015 finding cost. The proved developed finding cost excluding leasehold capital was $6.50 per BOE. Notably, sustainable LOE reductions drove positive reserve revisions that more than offset negative revisions due to lower commodity prices. As a result, our proved reserves increased by 1.4% year over year, driven by a 7.7% increase to crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves. These are record low finding costs and demonstrate the tremendous capital efficiency gains we made this year resulting from our permanent shift to premium drilling and laser focus on cost reductions. I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure. Timothy K. Driggers - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Billy. I'll begin with a few comments about our capital spending last year and in the fourth quarter. These amounts exclude the Yates transaction, which I'll cover separately. Capitalized interest for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $6 million. Total exploration and development expenditures were $748 million, including facilities of $122 million excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants, and other property, plant, and equipment were $31 million. For the full year 2016, capitalized interest was $31 million. 2016 capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations were $2.7 million, [sic] (billion) (2603) in line with the updated guidance provide on last quarter's call. This amount includes facilities of $375 million and expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant, and equipment of $92 million. Total discretionary cash flow was $2.75 billion. We are pleased to have reached our goal of balancing CapEx and (26:28) discretionary cash flow in 2016. In addition, proceeds from asset sales were $1.1 billion, which included natural gas assets in the Barnett Shale and Haynesville plays and marginal liquids plays in the Permian Basin and Rockies. We also completed the sale of Argentina assets during the year. Total property acquisition costs other than Yates were $14 million for the year. Capital additions related to the Yates transaction are : $3.1 billion of leasehold acquisitions; $735 million of proved property acquisitions; and $17 million of other property, plant, and equipment. We also recorded $1.1 billion of deferred taxes related to the transaction. To fund the Yates transaction, EOG issued 25 million shares of common stock and paid cash of $16 million for a total consideration of $2.4 billion. At year end, total debt outstanding was $7 billion, for a debt to total capitalization ratio of 32%. Considering $1.6 billion of cash on hand at year end, net debt to total cap was 28%. In the fourth quarter 2016, total impairments were $298 million. For the full year 2016, total impairments were $620 million. Impairments to proved properties of $116 million were primarily the result of a write-down to fair value of legacy natural gas assets, which have since been divested. Impairments for both the fourth quarter and full year 2016 included charges for firm commitment contracts related to the divested Haynesville natural gas assets and obsolete inventory. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 27% and deferred tax ratio was 44%. Yesterday we included a guidance table with our earnings press release for the first quarter and full year 2017. Our 2017 CapEx estimate is $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion excluding acquisitions. The exploration and development portion excluding facilities will account for about 81% of the total CapEx budget. The budget for exploration and development facilities and gathering, processing, and other accounts for approximately 19% of the total CapEx budget for 2017. We plan to concentrate our infrastructure spending in the Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin, and Rockies to support our drilling program in those areas and enhance operating efficiencies. Now I'll turn it back over to Bill. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Tim. In closing, I will leave you with a few important points. First, our improvement to well performance has been accomplished through the use of proprietary technology to identify high-quality rock, drill precisely targeted laterals, and execute leading-edge completions. We're now beginning to drill longer laterals. And we believe our industry-leading well performance combined with longer laterals will drive significant productivity gains in the future. Slide 10 in the IR deck illustrates this conclusion. Second, EOG has not and has never been a one-trick pony. We have top tier positions in the big three producing North American oil basins and strong positions in what we believe are the best emerging plays. Our diverse portfolio of assets and decentralized operating structure provides incredible flexibility to invest in the basins with the highest returns, particularly as technology, infrastructure, and netbacks change. Third, the recent downturn has highlighted one of EOG's core values, and that's capital discipline. There are two guiding principles to our capital discipline, a strong balance sheet and return-based capital allocation. EOG generated near record capital returns at the low point of the commodity price cycle last year. In addition, we not only maintained but improved our balance sheet without issuing equity to pay down debt or cutting the dividend. EOG is a leader in capital discipline, with a relentless focus on returns and a commitment to spend within our means. We are committed to delivering industry-leading oil growth and returns and delivering this within cash flow, including dividends, even in a flat $50 oil environment. Fourth, EOG's exploration focus is still in high gear. We have never been more excited about the leading-edge technology that we are developing in-house and the new exploration concepts we continue to discover. Everything we learn from our existing plays is being applied to generate new exploration concepts and leasing efforts. With new knowledge, we continue to see significant opportunities to add to and improve our inventory through exploration. Better rock makes better wells, and that's our exploration focus. Do not count us out. We're not through. And finally, in my 38 years with EOG, I've seen many downturns. Every time we emerged from the downturn in better shape than we entered it. This downturn, however, is unique in every respect except direction. We're not simply in better shape. We've vaulted ahead with record-setting achievements in cost reduction, productivity gains, inventory growth, and capital efficiency improvements. We have the deepest inventory of premium inventory in the industry, and it's growing rapidly. We are poised for amazing growth. And more importantly, our goal of returning to the historic levels of company ROCE performance are in sight. Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you, good morning. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Good morning, Brian. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: My first question is on the Eagle Ford from a primary drilling perspective. You talked about the increase in oil rates. Slide 40 shows some of this in terms of your wells in 2016 versus 2015 versus 2014. What are the implications for EURs and spacing from the improved well performance that you're seeing over multiple days? And if not yet certain there, can you just talk to the milestones that you're looking for to have more confidence? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Brian, this is Billy Helms. So yes, you're seeing on that slide that we see continued improvement in production performance year over year in the play. And that's really accomplishing lots of things, but it's really driven by our technology that we're bringing, mainly the targeting and the enhanced completions that we're doing now. Those two things have made a step change. So we're still testing some spacing patterns in different areas of the field and applying this new technology to understand longer-term performance. And as we've stated in the past, as we make these changes, we want to further understand the longer-term performance before we do our resource estimate increase. We are encouraged that the Eagle Ford is going to continue to improve with time, but we still are watching that data. The Eagle Ford has been essentially a very large laboratory for us to continue to experiment with. So as we continue to gather this data, we'll have a better idea of what that implication means to the long-term performance. So I can't really give you a timeframe yet, but I'd say that we're encouraged with what we see. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Then my follow-up is with regards to well costs. On slide 14, you talked about some targets for further cost reductions, which seems in the face of an inflationary environment we may be going into or are already in. Can you just talk about the achievability and whether these are more one-off we'll get there, or whether these are ultimate averages? What happens if prices aren't $50, they're a little bit higher in the inflation environment and assumptions that you've baked in? Gary L. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Brian, this is Gary. Yes, we look at each of the wells in the area. And what we see is about 40% of our well cost is subject to inflation because we've got contracts in place, we've got sole-source, all that sort of thing. When we do that and we look at what kind of opportunities we see for just other efficiency improvements, we believe that we'll be able to meet these targets that we've set here for each of these plays that's listed on this Exhibit 14. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Is there any upside? If oil prices are $55, then I guess one, we just apply the inflation to that 40% to get to something modestly higher. Gary L. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: As far as \u2013 irregardless of oil price, this is where we think that we'll be able to get here on this 2017 target. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you very much. Operator : We'll go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Good morning. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: You guys highlight more prominently exploration in the presentation and in your 10-K and in your comments this morning. Let me start. How derisked does a new play need to be before you'll disclose it? And outside of securing acreage, what are the key parameters necessary before you'll show it to investors? And I raise it from the context of peers, both U.S. and global, that have unveiled unconventional plays at much earlier stages, raising the risks as data is released. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: The first thing, Evan, is the play has to be premium quality, so it has to meet the investment hurdles that we've set for premium drilling. And then second of all, we like to have multiple tests, and we like to be really convinced that the play is going to work up to our expectations and we have some consistency about it. We don't want to drill a one or two-well wonder, then come back and some of the other wells are not so good. So we do take a little bit more time. I think it's because we're just more thorough and we want to be more sure about it. And then there's always, in every one of these plays, you mention acreage. Acreage is the critical thing. And we want to \u2013 as we test them, we learn more about where the sweet spots could be in the plays. And so we're only focused on tying up the sweet spots of that acreage. So we have a large number of plays in the company that we're working on. As you know, we're very decentralized, and each one of our operating divisions has a full set of exploration folks, and we're spread out all over the U.S. And so we're working multiple plays at the same time, and we're quite optimistic about new plays providing additional premium inventory in the future. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, I look forward to hearing results as we move through the year. My second question on the Permian, you guys are running 11 rigs and targeting 140 wells in 2017. Implied spud to spuds are up year over year. Any color there on maybe how many well completions in the 2017 program are being carried into 2018, or does the lower number of wells reflect a larger appraisal program? Or just some color around that sequentially would be helpful. Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Evan, this is Billy Helms. So what we're seeing there in the Delaware Basin is we've had a steady rig count, and we're typically going be drilling longer laterals in 2017 than we did in 2016. So the drilling times are going increase slightly just as a result of that. On the number of well completions, I believe we're going to complete about 140 total wells in the Delaware Basin this year, most of those in the Wolfcamp. And we're down to a normal level of inventory in all of our major plays, including the Delaware Basin. So we're not really carrying over into 2017 an abnormally high amount of DUCs, you might say. So I think we'll just \u2013 the rig count there has increased relative to last year. We will be going to longer laterals, but we'll have about 140 net wells completed this year. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Is there a carryover into 2018 I guess was my question because it seems as there would be on those numbers. Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: No, no, there's no carryover into 2018 that we see. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : And we'll now go to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. My first question is just on the overall guidance. Bill, you guys issued essentially in line oil production guidance, but you're using quite a bit of a lower oil price perhaps relative to strip and consensus, around $50. I was wondering if you could comment on how you plan to address the CapEx budget and guidance for the year. Do you plan to look at it on a quarterly basis or reassess things around the middle of the year? Because on our numbers, your cash flow would be closer to just under $5 billion using the strip. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Arun, we set the $50 marker just to give a reference point there. That's where we would be able to have a balanced cash flow to our CapEx and our dividend. So if prices are higher than that, we're going to have free cash flow, and that's certainly one of our goals every year is to generate free cash flow. As far as how we're going to deploy that, it's a bit early to give you specifics. The overall guidance would be that we're going to stay disciplined, obviously watch commodity prices, watch our drilling results and our cost and watch property sales. And we'll just update you every quarter on where we are on all that. I can say this. We have an extreme amount of flexibility. So with our decentralized structure and multiple high-return plays, it's very easy for EOG to redeploy capital, and we can do it relatively quickly. If one area, say, heats up and maybe it's difficult to get a frac spread or something in one area, we've got other areas that it's easier and they have high return. So we can ramp up relatively quickly. The priority for the free cash flow is to reinvest. That's the number one priority is obviously reinvest into high-return premium drilling. We also want to continue to firm up our balance sheet. We're going to do that primarily with non-core property sales. So we need to watch how that process proceeds. And then EOG's got a great track record of increasing the dividend, 16 times in the last 17 years. So consistent with that commitment to the dividend, as the year unfolds we'll continue to evaluate the business environment as it relates to the dividend. So again, I think we've got a lot of flexibility, and we'll give you more details on a quarterly basis. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's helpful. My follow-up is perhaps a follow-up to Brian's question. In terms of the Eagle Ford, you did show a positive rate of change in both the east and the west. My question is regarding the Q4 activity. If you look at some of the 30-day rates on the 75 wells, they're a touch below our expectations or type curve. Can you comment perhaps on what you saw in terms of productivity between the 45 wells which were drilled prior to 2016 versus the 30 that you drilled last year in terms of the impact perhaps of precision targeting in terms of well results? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Arun, this is Billy Helms. Certainly you're picking up on it there. In the fourth quarter, about 60% of our well completions were DUCs carried over from prior years. And those wells didn't benefit from the precision targeting that we have done more recently. And so you're seeing some of the 30-day initial IP rates from those wells being below those of previous quarters. But I think overall, after time you can see on that productivity chart that after about 120 to 150 days, they start to \u2013 because of the advanced completions, long-term performance is still improving. So we're continuing to be pleased with our technology and what it's yielding there both in longer-term performance as well as initial upfront productivity. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : We'll go now to Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks; good morning. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Hello, Scott. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Just as a follow-up to the question on looking at a higher commodity price and your ability to deploy that to more drilling, can you specifically discuss when you look at the market as it sits right now, strip probably closer to the mid-$50s, how do you internally look at that to make that decision whether to increase activity or not? So what I'm trying get to is what are the key indicators that provide you the confidence that oil's going be $55 or $60 rather than say $50? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Scott, I think we're watching the oil market, particularly inventory levels. And I think just in the last week or so, we're starting to see very encouraging signs on inventory drawdown, and I think we're getting close. It won't be in the next month or two. I think we're going to know a lot about how the OPEC cuts have affected supply/demand dynamics and the drawdown of that inventory. So we're about there, but we just need a little bit more time on that. I think the other thing is, with the rapid ramp-up of drilling rigs in the U.S., we don't want to ramp up too rapidly to decrease the capital efficiency. So we're very committed to keeping the capital efficiency of the company extremely high, and we really only want to increase the capital efficiency. So part of our ramp-up strategy will be certainly to stay very disciplined, to allocate the capital to obviously the highest return investments that we have, and then do it in a systematic manner where we're bringing in really good equipment, really good people, and we don't lose performance there. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay; appreciate that. And as my follow-up, just in terms of the progression of activity right now, where are we at in terms of your current activity, your rig count relative to what the budget contemplates? Are we there yet, or is there still a little bit of ramp to go in some areas? Gary L. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Scott, this is Gary. We've ramped up pretty rapidly here in 2017 because we ended 2016 with 17 drilling rigs, and we've now just this week reached 23. So we're a little bit heavier in the Delaware. We run about 11 rigs there. And then we're running in the seven to eight rigs in the Eagle Ford and a couple in the Rockies. So we're close. And like we mentioned earlier, yes, we've really been working hard just to get the very best available rigs in the industry. So we're pretty well there. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : I appreciate that; thanks. Operator : We'll go to Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Good morning, everyone. I think a lot of people when they hear you talk get very bearish on oil prices, and I don't think that's the way you look at the world. Bill, can you remind us why what you're doing isn't replicable across the industry, which is I guess the reason why people would be very bearish? Thanks. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Sure, Paul. The productivity that EOG has, the capital efficiency, which goes really back to our ability to contain costs and renew costs on a sustainable basis, and particularly as we've shifted to premium drilling over the last several years and we've applied the new technology. There's a chart on page 10 that we referred to in the opening remarks. And it shows well productivity for the industry as lateral lengths increase. And generally, when you look across all these plays, there's been quite a bit of studies, not just our studies, but this is basically IHS data that anybody can duplicate. It shows that as lateral lengths increase, obviously the well productivity is increasing. But EOG is in the red there. And if you look at that chart, you can see that our productivity is increasing much, much faster than generally the industry. Even our wells are much more productive even at a short lateral versus some of the laterals that are almost twice as long. So -- Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Bill, would you put that down to technology or acreage? Is there any way to \u2013 I know it's a very simplistic question for a very complicated... William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Well, it's two parts. It's better rock and you have to capture that better rock. So with our exploration focus over the years, we've really honed in on capturing the sweet spots of the best play. So that is the beginning of it. And then the second part of it is identifying the specific targets in those sweet spots, and then executing the lateral and a large percentage of that really great rock, and then using our very advanced, very proprietary completion techniques. So it's a combination of all that technology, and that is not very duplicable. It has taken us really a decade to get to this point. We have very proprietary petrophysical models that we do, obviously take a lot of cores, and we've tied that back into productivity data. And so it's a cumulative effect of a large amount of years in time and a lot of data, and it's not easily duplicated. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Yes, understood. Can I ask a follow-up as well? I think you're also somewhat unique in the way that you pay your staff. How does it in a sense like the company to think if you're returns focused? Why would you \u2013 I guess I'm trying to get around to the idea that you're still incentivized to grow. If you could, just remind us how the staff payment through returns works and how that affects your strategy. And I'll leave it there, thanks. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Sure. The bonus system has three metrics for each division, certainly for the folks here in Houston, and then it goes down to each employee. So the number one criterion on the bonus pool on the compensation is returns. So the capital returns that your division is responsible for and that you helped execute is the number one. Number two is how you meet your volume targets. So volume is second. Volume growth is second and returns are first. And then number three is how well you're setting yourself up for the future. So of course, we have a very strong culture of generating new inventory and better inventory all the time. And it all ties together. If you invest your money and you get a very, very high rate of return, you're going to grow your volumes spectacularly at the same time. So it all fits and it's very focused. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Why don't you think other people do it? Why do you think it's unique to you guys to use that methodology? I would have thought everyone should do that. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: I would say the same. I would agree. I think it's just a culture that's been in the company for decades and it just keeps getting better every year. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you, sir. Operator : We'll go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John H. Abbott - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Good morning. This is John Abbott speaking on behalf of Doug Leggate. We appreciate you taking our questions. Our first question relates to 2017 activity levels. How do you see the pace of completions throughout the course of the year? And then our follow-up would be, it looks like you exit 2017 with significant momentum. Could you provide an early look at the exit rate for the year and a preliminary view for 2018? Thank you. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Let me just answer the second part first. We have given a long-term outlook. That's provided on one of our slides. I'll give you the number here in a minute, but we've given an outlook at $50 to $60 oil. We can grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 15% to 25%. So you can look at that. That means that in the year 2020, EOG would be producing 500,000 to 700,000 barrels of oil per day. And so you can use that as a guide. As far as the specifics on 2017 about how we're going to schedule our completions, I'm going to let Gary Thomas comment on that. Gary L. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: John, we've got our completion schedule pretty well balanced each quarter through the year. And as I mentioned earlier, we had maybe a little slow start as far as just the ramp up of the rigs. And we also mentioned that once we take our rigs up that it's two to three months before you really start to see production from each of those rigs. So we do have a ramp from first quarter through 2017. John H. Abbott - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: We appreciate it, thank you. Operator : We'll go to Mike Scialla of Stifel Financial. Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. Looking at your 2017 CapEx increase over 2016, it doesn't look proportional to the number of wells. I think the CapEx up over 40%, the number of wells is about 7%. I know you had the benefit of completing some DUCs in 2016, and you alluded to this earlier, but I think a lot of that is due to longer laterals in 2017. So one, is that fair? And then two, if it is, do you have an average lateral length for the 2017 wells versus 2016? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Mike, the reason that the CapEx is going up \u2013 it's several reasons. Number one is the DUCs. As you mentioned. we had a little bit of a benefit there. The wells were already drilled. So we haven't drilled more wells this year than last year. But the wells are much better this year due to the technology and the higher shift to premium. The more capital per well on the completion side is due primarily to the Permian. We've increased the Permian well count substantially more than the other plays. And the wells are a bit more expensive in the Permian than they are in the Eagle Ford or the Bakken, and also because the wells are getting longer too. Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Any sense of the lateral length 2017 versus 2016? Gary L. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: It's up about 20%. As you say there, Mike, that's a part of our increase. The big part is just the increased drilling since we had so many DUCs in 2016. Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. I wanted to follow up on the Austin Chalk. Tim made some comments on that; that those wells do look really strong. Can you say where the 14 wells are located that you drilled so far? Are they all in the Austin Chalk, or is it spread across your Eagle Ford acreage? I know you want to see the results from this year's drilling program before you start talking about resource potential. But I just wanted to get any sort of sense on how much of that Eagle Ford acreage could be prospective. Are we talking maybe up to half, or is that way too optimistic? David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: This is David. On the Austin Chalk, that's really what we're focused on right now is delineating the play. So the 14 wells that you mentioned, those are really across the play. And so we continue to evaluate that. And so we're going to \u2013 the encouragement we saw from 2016, we're going to up that this next year in 2017 to 25 wells. And we'll do the same, we'll be testing some spacing patterns and then stepping out and seeing what the prospectivity is across the entire position. But we just want a little bit more time with the data. Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Just to follow up on that, did it look like it could be a resource-type play, or is it going be more one-off areas where you've got little isolated pockets that work? David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: One thing in the Austin, it's a little bit more geological than the Eagle Ford. And so we have multiple zones there that we're looking at, so we'll be testing each of those zones. So that's really why we want the opportunity to see the data and look at the spacing tests. Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, David. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session.

Gary Thomas, Billy Helms and David Trice will then discuss operational results. I'll discuss EOG's financials and capital structure and Bill will provide concluding remarks. Here's Bill Thomas. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks Tim. Our first quarter performance was a great start to the year. We beat our production targets and are on track to grow oil production 18% this year. As you may recall, last year we made a permanent shift to premium drilling which means that new wells must earn a minimum total weighted 30% return on direct drilling and completion capital at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. Our shift to premium drilling is the reason we can deliver high return double digit oil growth this year within cash flow including the dividend. Last quarter we talked about delivering this year's growth at $50 oil. We now believe we can deliver 18% oil growth within cash flow at $47 oil, a record for the company. Our premium strategy clearly sets EOG apart as one of the most capital efficient and lowest cost U.S. horizontal drillers. Our focus on growing low cost premium production will continue to drive down breakeven costs and strengthen our bottom line over time. Highlights from the first quarter include, one, both U.S. and total oil production beat the high end of our forecasts. Two, we increased our premium resource potential by 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent by converting 1,200 locations to premium for new total of 6.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent and 7,200 locations. That's a 27% increase in premium resource potential and 15 years of premium drilling at our current pace. Three, our Delaware Basin Whirling Wind wells set an industry all-time horizontal production record for the Permian Basin. Four, we continued to lower well costs in all our major plays and we are lowering full year operating cost guidance. And number five, the first quarter drilling program generated more than 70% direct after-tax rate of return. Generating high returns in today's price environment is a testament to the power of premium. It's also a testament, or rather the result of EOG's rate of return driven culture. When your entire team from entry-level professionals to executive management are incentivized by returns, as they are at EOG, it drives innovation. Innovative thinking is why EOG is consistently a first mover into brand new plays, delivering the best performing wells in the industry for the lowest cost in the industry. EOG was one of the first to both horizontally drill and hydraulically fracture the Barnett and the Bakken; the first to figure out that we can coax oil from extremely tight shale rock, leading to our second to none acreage position the Eagle Ford; the first to understand the benefits of complex near wellbore fractures versus biwing fractures; and the first to deploy high density completions and precision targeting that enables EOG to consistently deliver premium well performance. EOG's innovative culture incorporates rigorous geoscience, petrophysics and cutting-edge engineering in order to achieve return-focused technical advancements. Science and engineering of course requires data. 10 years ago, that data was analyzed using over-engineered spreadsheets. Today, we employ sophisticated analytics using our vast collection of data and technology tools that have been developed in-house at EOG. Now I'd like to introduce Sandeep Bhakhri, our Chief Information and Technology Officer. Sandeep has been with EOG 25 years on the front lines of EOG's information technology evolution. He will go into more detail on how EOG is using data science tools and mobile technology to enable faster innovation throughout the company. Sandeep Bhakhri - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. We've received a lot of questions recently on our in-house information technology, our proprietary data marts and apps, and especially our use of big data and data science. I'd like to walk you through our evolution and explain how our approach is different than most and why we have three key competitive advantages that cannot be easily replicated. The first competitive advantages is data. Data is king and one of our most valuable resources, and there are two pieces to it. One, you need comprehensive, integrated and easily accessible data sets, and two, you have to own the data. You cannot outsource its collection, analysis or delivery. EOG probably has the largest, most comprehensive and integrated data sets of any unconventional operator, having collected detailed data from more than 5,000 horizontal oil wells that we have drilled in almost every major unconventional play in the United States. The second advantage is data delivery. Data delivery is key to effective decision making. Data needs to be available 24/7, anytime, anywhere in easy to use software tools. Over the past 25 years, we have built successive generations of fit for purpose software tools such that today, EOG has a suite of best in class data delivery systems consisting of 65-plus software applications covering virtually every functional area of the business. These tools power our decision making, delivering raw, analyzed and learned data 24/7, anytime, anywhere. And our most important advantage, we have been doing this a very long time, almost three decades. It's simply part of our culture. Without a culture of innovation and continual learning, technology cannot thrive. And without world class technology, innovation and learning cannot happen. It's a virtuous cycle. Culture and technology aren't built overnight. If you haven't been doing both for a long time, you will have no source of a sustainable competitive advantage. Let me give you a little history. When I say we've been doing this a long time, I mean since the early 1990s. The cost saving trend at that time was to outsource information technology. EOG initially followed suit, but soon thereafter recognized the strategic mission-critical importance of IT and we decided to bring it back in-house. Rather than implement one size fits all behemoth back office systems in vogue at that time, we instead opted to customize and maintain our own accounting system. Then in 2000, the dot-com boom was in full swing and investments in technology allowed us to tackle our first major IT-enabled transformation, namely, to reduce organizational friction for data access. We call this answering the what question. For example, what is the current production of this well, what is the cost of this well, et cetera, et cetera. We built 10 web-based self-service applications, eliminating the need for employees to ask each other what questions and to instead focus on why and how questions. Using IT to help answer the why and how questions became even more important in 2010. The catalyst was the explosion of data and data analysis that was the Eagle Ford. EOG's development of the Eagle Ford generated orders of magnitude more data than at any other time in EOG's past, creating an ever-increasing need to have access to this data and analyze it ASAP. Our completion engineers were experimenting with completion designs for every well and sometimes every stage while our production engineers were analyzing high frequency production and pressure data from all our wells over our increasingly vast wireless field communications footprint. Third-party data collection tools were not keeping up with our demand. This was the start of our data collection and data storage initiatives that led to our eight huge proprietary integrated data marts that now house data across virtually every functional area of our business. We believe they are the most comprehensive collection of integrated unconventional oil and gas data sets in the industry. Simultaneously, they began data delivery initiatives that resulted in over 45 desktop applications that were fit for purpose custom tools accessing our ever-growing proprietary data marts. The very first in 2008 was a reservoir analysis tool with custom algorithms that allow our reservoir engineers to analyze well performance in a significantly shorter time than standard decline curve analysis. Since then, EOG has built a comprehensive suite of world class commercial grade apps that address every functional area of our business. Combined, our eight proprietary data marts and our 45-plus desktop applications help EOG engineers answer the why and how questions more quickly than ever before, which in turn shows up as superior well performance, lower cost and innovative exploration ideas. Our latest technology evolution began two years ago with our move to real-time data collection and mobile data delivery systems. While we were already getting production data real-time, we built custom black boxes to retrieve real-time data from every rig and every completion spread. This in turn spurred the need for mobile versions of our existing apps. In two short years, we have developed what we believe to be 20 of the most sophisticated mobile applications in the oil and gas business. We did it quickly by leveraging our existing proprietary data marts as well as our wireless communication footprint. Real-time data and our mobile apps are a major productivity game changer. People at EOG are connected 24/7, anytime, anywhere to the same data. We call it having a control room in your pocket. Add to this our culture of bottom-up decision making that doesn't require multiple layers of approvals and you have an environment of accelerated analysis, innovation and change at the speed of thought. In a moment, David Trice will share a new drilling record reach in the first quarter using one of the toolkits we built in-house for precision targeting using mobile access to real-time data. So what's next? How do big data and data science fit into our competitive advantage? It's actually very simple. The incoming real-time data is richer in meaning and significantly larger in volume, and therefore requires newer technologies to efficiently store, organize and access this data. Enter big data technologies. And the larger and more multidimensional our data gets, it becomes imperative to revamp our traditional analytical engines. Enter data science. Big data technologies allow us to solve problems in fractions of the time it took with traditional technologies. And data science, or machine learning or predictive analytics are a perfect fit for the rich and variable data sets that resulted from the constant experimentation and learning that is EOG. To sum up, number one, we believe EOG has the richest, most comprehensive integrated data sets in the world for unconventional oil and gas powered by the latest data technologies. Number two, we believe EOG has the most comprehensive suite of proprietary, custom built, fit for purpose tools delivering data 24/7, anytime, anywhere, be it raw, analyzed or learned. And number three, number one and number two are possible because of, and enhanced by, our unique culture of innovation and learning. Thank you very much, and next is Gary Thomas to review our operations performance for the quarter. Gary L. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thank you, Sandeep. Last quarter, I talked about our cost reduction targets for 2017 and sources of savings we expected would offset tightening in the oil field services market and potential inflation. I'm pleased to report that we are on course to reach our cost reduction goals for the year, and in some basins, we've already achieved the targets set at the start of the year. During the first quarter, EOG continued to reduce costs throughout our operations. Delaware Basin completed well costs averaged $7.8 million during the first quarter, an 8% reduction from 2016. $7.8 million was our original 2017 cost target for this play, so we've set a new lower target of $7.6 million. Eagle Ford well cost in the first quarter declined 4% from the 2016 average of $4.5 million, which is already half way to our target of $4.3 million. In the Bakken, we reduced well costs 6% to $4.8 million, which is more than half way to our $4.8 million target. We updated our cash operating costs guidance for the year and in total, we expect it to be lower than initially forecast. On the production side, we beat the high end of our forecast in almost every category. Our teams working each play are executing according to schedule and plan, and the production beats are being driven by well results that continued to exceed expectations. Another notable item regarding our updated 2017 guidance, we now expect to average 26 rigs in 2017, which is three more than our initial plan for the same amount of capital. That's further testament to how ongoing cost reductions and well productivity improvement continue to drive record capital efficiency. Even with additional rigs, we are not yet changing our target to complete 480 net wells this early in the year. Additional rigs provide flexibility to our operations and allow us to reduce production lumpiness that results from developing larger multi-well pads. Several of our rigs are on well-to-well contracts, so we have the flexibility to increase or decrease wells as we monitor the macro environment and respond accordingly. I'll turn the call over to Billy Helms, who will provide you an update on our Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin plays. Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Gary. The Eagle Ford continues to deliver solid results. This world class play is increasingly being developed with larger multi-well pads, where we continue to achieve efficiency improvements that are helping to drive down costs. Our acreage is currently 97% held by production and by the end of the year we expect it to be 99%. As a result, we have even more flexibility to optimize operations using multi-well pads. We are also ringing out additional drilling efficiencies through innovative operations such as offline cementing. Improvements to drilling and completions that speed our time to first production not only lowers costs but also minimizes the impact to volumes due to downtime from nearby well shut-ins. Through a combination of cost reductions, longer laterals and advancements in precision targeting, we converted 500 net wells in our Eagle Ford inventory to premium status this quarter. That's more than two times the number of Eagle Ford wells we are completing in 2017. The total premium net count, net location count is now 2,425, representing more than 10 years of high return inventory. In addition, our G&G team continues to refine our targeting model to identify the optimal lateral placement and development spacing. With over 0.5 million acres, we have much left to understand and explore. The play changes significantly throughout our acreage, and we are working hard to delineate where the Lower Eagle Ford may have two distinct targets, and where the quality of the Upper Eagle Ford is high enough to produce premium wells. Delaware Basin is arguably the most prolific tight well play in North America, and EOG continues to deliver the best well results in the industry. See slides 13 through 15 in our investor presentation for an update. We produced a number of competing headlines with our first quarter performance to lead off this discussion. First, the performance of our Whirling Wind wells in Lea County generated record setting results. This package of full wells averaged 30-day IPs of 3,510 barrels of oil per day each from laterals that averaged about 7,100 feet. While all four may have individually set an all-time record, the Whirling Wind 11 Fed Com #704H topped the list at 6,230 barrels of oil equivalent per day, or more specifically 4,350 barrels of oil per day plus 845 barrels of NGLs and 6.2 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. The 24-hour IP was a staggering 8,990 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We're certain this sets a new horizontal record for the entire Permian Basin. Take a look at slide 14 of our investor presentation. Had the Whirling Wind wells not existed, the spotlight would have been on an exceptional Lea County three-well package also completed during the first quarter. The Braswell 16 State Com #707H through #709H 30-day IPs averaged 3,080 barrels of oil equivalent per day each, and notably, these wells were drilled using shorter 4,300 foot laterals. Our shift to premium has led to increased activity in the Delaware Basin this year, which is delivering overall outstanding results. EOG completed 33 Wolfcamp wells in the first quarter of 2017. Impressively, 27 of those wells exhibited 30-day IPs in excess of 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Operationally, our Delaware Basin continues to deliver record setting results. As Gary mentioned, completed well costs in the first quarter have already met the target set for the year, and drilling shaved off a full day from spud to total depth compared to the 2016 average. In addition, the capital directed towards facilities and infrastructure is delivering solid results by lowering both our direct well cost as well as achieving lower production cost. This long-term infrastructure plan provides the ability to cost effectively manage both our needs for water to drill and complete our wells, but also handle the produced water volumes from these prolific wells. Our water plan also includes an increase in the amount of water we recycle for use in the drilling and completion process. This investment in infrastructure has allowed our Delaware Basin wells to have the lowest operating cost of any of our oil producing assets in the entire company. All these efforts allowed us to convert another 700 net locations in our Delaware Basin inventory to premium status. Between the Wolfcamp, Second Bone Springs and the Leonard, our Delaware Basin acreage now holds a total of 4,150 premium net locations, providing more than 20 years of high return drilling inventory. Our exploration team continues to unravel the heterogeneity and complexity of the Delaware Basin's mile-deep column, and we expect to test additional target intervals this year. As we have discussed in the past, a thorough understanding of the lithology, along with EOG's precise targeting capability is a major reason for these outstanding well performance results. Based on early test results, we expect these additional intervals to provide EOG peer-leading results across the basin. In summary, the additional premium well locations in both the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin have replaced our forecasted 2017 drilling program 2.5 times just one quarter into the year. Here's David Trice to review the progress we made in the Austin Chalk and our Rockies, Bakken and international activity. David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Billy. We completed five more wells in the Austin Chalk during the first quarter, producing excellent results consistent with the well performance we achieved last June. Our Austin Chalk completed well costs are already averaging a low $5.2 million per well, delivering premium economics. These five wells produced an average per well 30-day initial rate of over 2,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day from an average lateral of 5,700 feet. The 19 Austin Chalk wells we've drilled to date along with additional core taken during the first quarter has provided tremendous insight into the Austin Chalk depositional model and reservoir characteristics on our acreage. We are still learning about the Austin Chalk and its potential. For this reason, we are not yet ready to give a resource estimate for this prolific target. In the Bakken, we continued to draw down our inventory of uncompleted wells in the first quarter. Even when loaded with higher historical drilling cost, these wells have a low average completed well cost of $4.8 million for 8,400 feet of treated lateral. During the first quarter, we completed three new wells in our Bakken Lite area using high-density completions for the first time, two of these wells targeted the Bakken interval and one targeted the Three Forks. The Ross 42, 43 and 106 came online with an average per well 30-day rate of almost 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with a completed well cost of only $4.6 million for an average lateral of 7,700 feet. These wells are premium. With continued success in the Bakken Lite area, we could add to our Bakken premium inventory over time. While most of the completion activity was in the Bakken during the first quarter, we continued to make premium wells in the Wyoming DJ and Powder River Basin. In the DJ Basin, we brought online nine Codell wells in the first quarter. While the 30-day IPs on these wells are not flashy, averaging 710 barrels of oil equivalent per day each on 8,600 foot laterals, the production is flat and the well cost continues to rapidly fall. Normalized to 9,000 feet, DJ Basin well costs are just $4.5 million. In addition, we set some new drilling records in the Codell. The Pole Creek 531-2536H was drilled to a total measured depth of almost 18,000 feet in only three days. With a drilled lateral of nearly 9,000 feet, the average rate of penetration in the lateral was over 7,800 feet per day and was drilled 100% in zone even though the target window was only 10 feet. This accomplishment was the direct result of EOG's performance-driven culture and integration of drilling technology, real-time data delivery and in-house software applications. Our geosteering and drilling software serves our needs better than any third-party applications available on the market today. Our geosteering team can receive a real-time feed of EOG data directly into our software to interpret and integrate with offset well control and seismic data. All this information can be viewed and interpreted on a desktop or mobile application, so everyone associated with the well are in constant communication and can collaborate regardless of where they're located. It's essentially a distributed control room. The benefits are immediately visible as lower cost and better well performance. Furthermore, even though the Pole Creek 531 was the record well, two other wells on the same pad were drilled in 3.5 days, demonstrating the ability to consistently perform at a high level. In the Powder River Basin, we continue to delineate and analyze this large and complex basin. While completions were limited in the first quarter, the results are consistently premium. We completed five wells averaging 1,160 barrels of oil equivalent per day on 4,900 foot laterals. Three of the five wells were legacy untargeted Yates wells, but with the well costs so low, they are premium. Normalized at 8,000 feet, the Powder River Basin completed well cost averaged only $5 million. We look forward to a more active program in the Powder River Basin throughout the remainder of 2017 and beyond as we continue to block up acreage on our current plays and explore for new plays in this resource-rich basin. In Trinidad, we completed our five-well program for the Sercan joint venture project, bringing the remaining four gross wells online during the first part of the year. The successful project came in under cost and produced the well rates ranging from 20 million to 120 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. For the remainder of 2017, we are on target to drill at least four more offshore Trinidad wells in other project areas. In addition, we recently finished a state of the art ocean bottom nodal, or OBN, seismic survey with a JV partner and expect final data to be delivered by the first quarter of 2018. This new seismic will allow us to identify new prospects to supplement our future drilling plans. We are also in the final stages of negotiating terms of the new gas contract with National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago that would provide price certainty on future gas volumes. In conjunction with this gas contract, EOG has committed to a new proprietary OBN seismic survey over its SECC block that will set up new prospects on EOG acreage for 2019 and beyond. With this new gas contract and new seismic survey, we expect to be busy drilling premium wells and maintaining our gas production in Trinidad for many years to come. In the East Irish Sea, we are not anticipating any oil lifting to Conwy during the second quarter due to some ongoing facility issues. Full production rates are expected to resume sometime in the third quarter. I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure. Timothy K. Driggers - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, David. We're on track for the first quarter, investing approximately one quarter of our 2017 forecasted capital expenditures. Total exploration and development expenditures for the first quarter were $966 million, including facilities of $148 million and excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $34 million. Capitalized interest for the first quarter 2017 was $7 million. At quarter end, total debt outstanding was $7 billion for a debt to total capitalization ratio of 33%. Considering $1.5 billion of cash on hand at March 31, net debt to total capital was 28%. In the first quarter of 2017, total impairments were $193 million. Impairments to proved properties of $138 million were primarily the result of a write-down to fair value of legacy natural gas assets. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28% and the deferred tax ratio was 6%. Yesterday we included a guidance table with the earnings press release for the second quarter and full year 2017. Our 2017 CapEx estimate remains unchanged at $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion excluding acquisitions. The exploration and development portion, excluding facilities, will account for about 81% of the total CapEx budget. The budget for exploration and development facilities and gathering, processing and other accounts for approximately 19% of the total CapEx budget for 2017. We plan to concentrate our infrastructure spending in the Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin and Rockies to support our drilling programs in those areas and enhance operating efficiencies. Now I'll turn it back over to Bill. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Tim. In closing, I'll leave you with a few important points. First, EOG's Delaware Basin acreage position and results are proving to be the best in the industry. Our record setting wells and ongoing cost reduction are generating the best capital returns and delivering the highest capital efficiency in the Permian Basin. Second, we're not just a Permian company. We are achieving premium returns and oil growth in five core plays. Every core play continues to get better and provides EOG with the largest and highest quality horizontal asset base in North America, with decades of high return growth potential. Third, as we discussed today, EOG continues to be the leader in horizontal technology. Our culture thrives on innovation, and we develop new ideas time and time again. With our extensive proprietary databases and sophisticated analytics, we are turning out new innovative ideas rapidly. We believe we are extending our leading technology faster than ever before. EOG's culture and technology advancement are a sustainable competitive advantage. Fourth, we're on track to deliver high return oil growth within cash flow. We said last quarter that we could deliver 18% oil growth within cash flow at $50 oil. With our increased confidence in cost reduction, we now believe we can deliver that 18% growth within cash flow including the dividend with $47 oil. As more and more of the low cost premium wells are brought online, our bottom line breakeven will continue to improve over time. And finally, EOG is on target to achieve our 2020 vision and to accomplish the following four goals : first, to be the U.S. leader in return on capital employed; second, to be the U.S. oil growth leader; third, to be among the lowest cost producers in the global oil market; and fourth, commitment to safety and the environment. Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A. Kim? Operator : Thank you. Our first question today will come from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Good morning, Brian. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I wanted to get a bit more color on the Eagle Ford. Slide 40 shows the productivity both in both the east and the west, and you talked in your prepared comments to a number of returns-enhancing initiatives via cost reductions. If we look at, from a well productivity perspective when you take into account the benefits of targeting and data analytics that you discussed, what are your expectations for how 2017 and perhaps 2018 wells could look like in the context of slide 40? How much additional room do you see for further well productivity gains, specifically in the Eagle Ford? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: So yes, Brian. This is Billy Helms. Yes, in 2017, we don't have it on the chart, as you mentioned, but what we're seeing is we're delivering consistently better and better wells in every one of our areas. On the chart we show producing days of 360 days. We don't yet, being this early in the year, we don't yet have that many days of production on our 2017 wells. That's why the slide is not updated. But generally, what we're seeing is improving well performance even though in some areas, we're offsetting some depletion in some of the patterns that we're drilling. But overall, the targeting and the high density completions are continuing to improve our well performance. In addition, we are moving, as you noted, we're moving to more and longer laterals in our patterns, and that in addition is generating overall higher EURs per well. So I think we're pretty pleased. It's still early yet to say where that's heading, but we're excited about what we're seeing to date. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks. And my follow-up is with regards to the CapEx budget and guidance for the year. As you mentioned, you added three rigs but no additional completion activity. Can you add a bit more color on what seems like is a build-up by the end of the year in uncompleted inventory and what you would want to see or need to see to begin to complete those wells? Gary L. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Brian, this is Gary. And as you said, yes, we continue to reduce our costs. So we'll drill more wells with the same CapEx guidance. We depleted our uncompleted inventory last year, and now we're just building that premium inventory. And previously, we would drill two to three-well pads. Now we're drilling five to six-well pads. With more wells per pad, that just means that we have fewer overall pads and fewer options or locations for our frac fleets. And this could be a problem if we can't find a pad to move on for some reason. So we just needed the additional pads, which means more wells for each frac fleet. Thankfully our well costs are really low, so that's just a low cost insurance for flexibility and optionality. And it's still too early in the year and oil prices are too volatile to make adjustments to our guidance. But if we can adjust readily and we can lay down rigs, we can add inventory or we can add more completions. But just our primary focus is to invest within cash flow and the highest return premium wells. Operator : Moving on, we'll hear from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you and good morning everybody. Bill, I wonder if I could take a follow-up to that. I guess it's kind of a philosophical question given oil is back at $46 or something like that today. You're clearly the most efficient operator in the industry. There's no question about that. But my question is what's your appetite for a 15% to 25% growth rate in this environment? Because you're giving up some of the best wells in the industry and for one of the lowest oil price environments. And I guess what's behind my question is, while you're obviously best of the best I guess within the sector, your return on capital employed last year was still in negative territory. So I guess my question is, what's the rush in a $46 world despite the quality of the inventory. And I've got a follow-up specifically to Whirling Wind, please. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Doug, the returns we're getting on these premium wells at $50 in, at $45 is very, very strong. It's in the $40 to $50, $60-plus in the first quarter, we were at 70% rate of return. So we feel like the economics of the wells even at low oil prices is extremely strong and the right call for the shareholders to continue to reinvest in those. We also have a very strong confidence. You heard us talk about this over the years that we can replace that inventory much, much faster than we're drilling it, so we don't believe we're spending our best wells in the lowest oil price. We believe that our wells actually will continue to improve over time as we continue to find better rock and apply new technologies. So our commitment is to grow within cash flow and to grow at very, very high return capital reinvestment rates and we believe that's the way to build shareholder value. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good morning. I was wondering at first, could you provide some color on which intervals were contained in the 700 premium locations that were added in the Delaware Basin? I mean it seems like you had good results in several different intervals, so I'm just wondering if we could get a little color there. Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yes. Jeff, this is Billy Helms. On the increase there in the Delaware Basin, the majority of those are in the Wolfcamp. Of the 700 we added in the Delaware Basin, 425 were in the Wolfcamp and the remainder there in the Bone Springs and the Leonard. So the majority of it was driven by the Wolfcamp. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Great. Thank you. And as a follow-up, in the Powder River Basin, the lateral lengths were fairly short this quarter relative to most of the other intervals developed during first quarter 2017. I'm just wondering if there is any color on that. Was it determined by lease geometry? Are you working towards increasing lateral length over the rest of the year? David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yes, this is David. In the Powder River as we noted, three of the five that we brought online were legacy Yates wells and they were short laterals. And then we do on occasion drill some of the shorter laterals due to lease issues but really on a go-forward basis, we're planning in the Powder to be drilling all two-mile laterals. So that's what you'll see in the majority of the laterals in the future. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Subash Chandra from Guggenheim. Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Yes. Hi. So this quarter, a lot of Delaware operators are talking about what pads might look like in development. Could you discuss where you are in that transition, if the wells we're seeing right now are pretty representative of what they might look like in future years? Or will there be a dramatic change in how you go about developing the stack in Delaware? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yes, Subash. This is Billy Helms. So in the Delaware Basin, I'd say we're still in the early innings of trying to develop our multi-well pads. We're testing largely, as you know, the Wolfcamp interval to start with and we've still got a lot of horizons to test, both most of which are above the Wolfcamp. And so we're looking at what is the optimal way to increase our well count in this area and ultimately end up with a greater number of wells in each section or spacing unit that we drill. But recently I think right now we're probably drilling on average three or four wells per pad initially, and we're coming back in behind that with additional development. Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC : And I think in your intro comments you talked about EOG's experience in understanding density and well interference in prior plays, so is your gut feel that in development that you'll need to pull back on completion intensity, avoid pressure sinks and that sort of thing when you look at your prior experience elsewhere? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yes, Subash. This is Billy Helms again. I'd say we haven't seen that occur yet. We're continuing to optimize the spacing and completion design for every interval. Each interval is uniquely designed with the data that we collect that we've talked about and all of our tools that we use to analyze what is the best and most optimal way to develop each zone. So we haven't yet seen a limitation on how we space the wells or how we design our frac treatments. I'd say they're more customized. There's not a one size fits all I guess is the way I'd think about that. They're all optimized. I'd say we're still testing downspacing in several areas. Our resource assessment is based on our most recent analysis, but we're testing those and pushing the limits as we speak. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good morning. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Good morning. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning. The point on longer lateral lengths, obviously you're extending them in the Eagle Ford as well as the Permian. Can you discuss, specifically with the Permian where there seems to be a pretty big opportunity as you look forward, how much blocking and tackling is there yet to do on bolting on acreage? And where do you ultimately think that could end up? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: The Permian, we have been historically in the years past 4,500 to 5,000 foot. I think the average lateral length this year is about 7,000 foot, and we continue to put acreage positions or bolt on acreage positions. We're trading acreage with other operators and consolidating positions to help us to continue to extend those laterals even further. So I think it will grow incrementally over time. It may not be the 10,000-plus lateral lengths like we've done in some of the other plays, but it will continue to improve and get better over time. The uplift on the economics is pretty dramatic on the longer laterals because they don't cost near as much, and so you get a big uplift on the economics and the returns on the longer laterals. And we've been able to, I think the most important thing, with our precision targeting technology and identifying the best rock and our ability to keep that bit in the best rock the entire lateral length, has allowed us to continue to have the same productivity per foot on the longer laterals as we do on the shorter ones. So if a long lateral is twice as long, we actually get twice as much oil. So that's a big technology gain that we've made just recently. Operator : We'll go next to Irene Haas from Wunderlich. Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Yes. Hey. Good morning. Congratulation on the Whirling Wind wells. They're truly impressive. Just wondering if they are from the Upper Wolfcamp. And then what is driving the performance? Is it the completion techniques, geosteering of better rocks? And can this be replicated over a large area? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yes, Irene. This is Billy Helms. So those Whirling Wind wells are drilled in the Upper Wolfcamp, and what really led to the high production rates that we've seen is a combination of several things that we've talked about. And I see it leads off with understanding the geology and understanding where the best rock is and then being able to keep the target in that best rock throughout the length of the lateral, and these are over 7,000 foot laterals. And then combining that with the high density completion technology that we continue to advance, those, the combination of things is what led to that production increase, and we don't think we've reached the peak of that knowledge yet. We think we still have advancements that will continue to drive productivity increases throughout the play. Every play, the geology changes across the basin, so every location won't be exactly like the Whirling Wind wells, but there's still a lot of potential for improvement across the play. Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: So should we expect sort of a more spectacular flow rate as such in the future, maybe from slightly different geographic area? Can this be replicated? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yes, Irene, I wouldn't say that we'll continue to set record after record after record every well we drill, but I'd say the uplift on the overall program will continue to increase and I think, one thing that I think I would add some color to is that as we have stepped out with the inclusion of the Yates acreage, as we've stepped out across the play, we've seen uplift in the productivity more than so than we expected when we acquired that position. And so we've been pleasantly surprised by the application of the EOG technology to the acreage that we acquired in the Yates position to improve productivity across the basin. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Morris from Citi. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. My question actually was along the line of what Irene's was, and congratulations on the great well results, and Sandeep did a great job outlining the big data and analytics that you're using to improve these well results. But in the increase in performance and in premium inventory theme, so (51:43) you've outlined it's more to do with targeting within the horizontal lateral of the wells more so than longer lateral length and lower well costs. But in understanding that lithology, what is the difference in the rock that you're targeting? And is there that much variability across the zone? In other words, is that rock that you're targeting a lot more fracture prone? Is it just more oil saturated? Or what is the characteristic of that zone that you're able to target, and how variable is the rock across the formation when you target that zone? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Bob, this is Bill Thomas. You're asking some information that's proprietary. But I'll give you some general guidelines. Certainly, the rock is variable in the Permian, particularly in the Delaware Basin. There is a lot of variability in a vertical sense and then laterally it does vary some too. So you need a lot of data to identify it, and we start with cores. We do an extensive amount of core work, full cores and analyze that rock. We integrate that into a petrophysical model and then we integrate all that data into 3-D seismic, and we create very detailed maps, structure maps and stratographic thickness maps before we even start to drill the well. So it does take a lot of very sophisticated geology to identify these targets and it takes a lot of data and a lot of really good G&G and engineering work to locate that lateral. And then importantly, we developed the in-house software as Sandeep and David described to keep the bit in that really good rock, 95% to 100% of the lateral. And when we do that and we do the sophisticated high-density completions, that's why the wells are so good. And so the goal is just continue to identify better zones, to have better execution and to continue to improve the frac technology over time. So we think there's a lot of upside left and we're very encouraged directionally, technically where we're headed. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So you think \u2013 I know you said you won't set record after record after record \u2013 but you feel that you're still moving up the learning curve and everything you just described that so that we should see better well results across the board if you continue to be better able to target those better zones, I would assume, here. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Certainly. That's the goal, Bob, and that's our hope. We consistently improve performance over time and we are continuing to develop new tools and new ideas, and so we're hopeful that will continue in a very strong direction in the future. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Well, we'll look forward to that. Thank you. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.: Good morning, Bill, and to you and the rest of your team there. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Hello, Charles. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.: I wanted to ask, and Bill, this might be for you or perhaps for Sandeep, but I wonder if you could give us, without giving too much away, can you give us a sense of the kind of data types and streams you're capturing now versus perhaps what you were doing a year or two years ago? And what new sorts of data, or opportunities for data capture you might be looking at a couple years down the road? Sandeep Bhakhri - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yes, Charles. This is Sandeep. I'll take that question. I would say the biggest change for us versus a couple of years ago is the real-time data that's streaming in. And as the data comes in with higher resolution with some of the black boxes that they're putting out on the rigs and our frac fleets, we're able to get a lot more insight into the data, and we're able to turn that into new learnings and translate that into the high productivity wells. The best example of that is just the data that we're getting real-time in now to help us geosteer, and I think that's the biggest delta change from the past, where the data wasn't as real-time. And then, on the frac side of the business, it's the same thing. We're getting real-time data coming in from every frac fleet, and so we're able to change our completion designs and accommodate real-time, understanding what the rock is telling us. So those would be two concepts that are different, say, from two or three years ago. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.: Got it. Thanks, Sandeep, and that really fits well with, I was going to ask the same question about those Whirling Wind wells, but I think you guys have explained it's an intersection of the targeting, fracking, everything well. If I could ask just question perhaps for David Trice about the Austin Chalk. I recognize you guys are not ready to put a resource number on that, but I'm curious if you could elaborate a bit on how you see that evolving. Is this kind of a, maybe a kind of a polka dots across the map of different hotspots? Or is this kind of all concentrated in one area? And what's a timeline for, your best guess as to timeline for when you will kind of mature that? David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yes, Charles. I'd say on the Austin Chalk, we've certainly learned a lot about it over the last several quarters, and you know we just wanted to continued to do step-out wells, the targeting test and spacing test as well. We've got several spacing tests over the last several months. We've done some at 400 feet and some at 600 feet, and the results are good on all of those. But we're still trying to dial in the exact spacing. But just keep in mind, I mean it's a lot different than what the traditional chalk was like. If you think about the traditional fractured chalk, you had really wide spacing, and this is going to be much more of a resource-type play. So nobody's ever really kind of chased the chalk in this way. So we just want to have a little bit more time and collect some more data. We've collected a couple cores and quite a few logs, and we're really, most of our testing has been across a 10 to 20 mile stretch on our acreage, but in the coming quarters, we'll have some updates. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.: That's helpful color. Thank you. Timothy K. Driggers - EOG Resources, Inc.: Okay. I think we can close the call. Operator : And we do have one more question. Would you like to take that? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Sure. Go ahead. Operator : It comes from Marshall Carver from Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Marshall Hampton Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : All right. Thank you for squeezing me in. You highlight individual wells in the presentation. We tend to think of premium wells as the median result. What are your thoughts around standard deviation around your IPs and EURs as you're heading forward? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Marshall, I think there's a slide in the IR deck. I think it's slide 10 that gives the metrics on our premium wells that we completed last year versus the non-premium wells, and they are remarkably better. I think this is one of the things in the Street that may be a little bit misunderstood. The premium wells are roughly, the returns on them are roughly a fivefold increase in returns. The finding costs are less than half. The capital efficiency is more than twice as good and the first year oil production on the premium versus non-premium is actually double. So the premium wells are remarkably better than the wells that EOG has historically drilled in the past, and EOG's in the past has drilled the best wells, we believe in the industry. So the premium wells are certainly a game changer for the company. And as we go forward and we add these low cost reserves to our reserve base, they will continue to drive down our DD&A rate, and that will filter to the bottom line. Our breakevens will be better and certainly help us on ROCE. So they're remarkably better wells, and I think that's maybe not quite understood by the Street. Thank you, Marshall. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: In closing, the company is getting off to a great start in 2017. Each division in the company is focused on delivering industry leading premium wells, and we're tremendously excited about the future of the company. Over time, those low cost reserves will improve our bottom line and continue to create long-term shareholder value. So thank you for listening and thank you for your support. Operator : And that concludes our conference today. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir. Tim Driggers : Thank you. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing second quarter 2017 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release in EOG\u2019s SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC\u2019s reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release in the Investor Relations page of our website. Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Gary Thomas, President and Chief Operating Officer; Billy Helms, EVP, Exploration and Production; David Trice, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing Operations; Sandeep Bhakhri, Senior VP and Chief Information and Technology Officer; and David Streit, VP Investors and Public Relations. An update of our presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening, and we included guidance for the third quarter and full year 2017 in yesterday\u2019s press release. This morning, we\u2019ll discuss topics in the following order : Bill Thomas will review second quarter highlights followed by operational results from Gary Thomas, Sandeep Bhakhri, Billy Helms, Lance Terveen and David Streit. I will discuss EOG\u2019s financials and capital structure, and Bill will provide concluding remarks. Here\u2019s Bill Thomas. Bill Thomas : Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Over this last quarter, the question we received most often from the investment community was, how does EOG plan to respond to lower oil prices. Obviously, that question isn\u2019t unique to ask as the entire industry is being asked to demonstrate capital discipline in the face of extended lower commodity prices. EOG is a return incentivized company and it has been since its founding. So our commitment to capital discipline is our core value and the fundamental driver of EOG\u2019s history of peer-leading returns. From the beginning of the downturn in 2014, we have consistently executed a disciplined plan to return to industry-leading ROCE and industry-leading U.S. oil growth. This morning, we\u2019re pleased to report that EOG\u2019s second quarter results are right on target to achieve those goals. Our premium drilling strategy is the key. We continue to add low-cost premium reserves, driving down our DD&A rate and improving our ability to earn net income over time. Premium well results are the reason we returned the strong U.S. oil growth in 2017. Furthermore, during the second quarter, we exceeded all U.S. production targets. As a result, we increased 2017 U.S. oil production growth guidance from 18% to 20%. Our goal remains delivering cash flow, covering capital and the dividend. As outlined on Slide 7 of our investor presentation, premium drilling is already having a substantial impact on our production, finding costs and DD&A. Compared to 2016, oil production is forecast to grow 20%, while our DD&A rate is forecast to decrease 9%. In addition to strong growth this year, we continue to execute our robust exploration program to capture low cost acreage in plays that we believe could contain premium quality rock that would add to our growing 10 year inventory of premium drilling locations. With everywhere we drill, we collect new data that we incorporate into our big data systems. We are constantly learning how different types of tight rocks respond to horizontal technology. And we apply this knowledge to capture new acreage in exploration plays and to drill better wells in our existing plays. As we\u2019ve said many times before, the key to great wells is high quality rock. Our multi decade database and the learning curve gives us a huge lead in identifying the best rock to add new and better drilling potential to the company. Each one of our 7 U.S. exploration teams is generating new prospects that make the company better. The exploration potential is a key sustainable advantage for EOG. Disciplined capital efficiency, returns, exploration and growth are EOG hallmarks, and our second quarter performance continues to demonstrate the outstanding results. Looking forward, regardless of where oil prices go from here, EOG will respond accordingly. We are committed to returns, delivering within our means and a strong balance sheet. We believe production growth should be the result of investing in high return drilling, and have never been fans of outspending cash flow to pursue growth for growth\u2019s sake. We are doing all the things that keep us marching towards our ultimate goal of delivering sustainable, long term shareholder value. Now I will turn it over to Gary Thomas to discuss our second quarter production and cost achievements in more detail. Gary Thomas : Thank you, Bill. The second quarter of 2017 marks EOG\u2019s fourth consecutive quarter of domestic oil production growth. We delivered this high return oil growth, balancing CapEx with cash flow at an oil price roughly half of the peak in 2014. That accomplishment is a direct result of our permanent shift to premium drilling. Furthermore, second quarter production exceeded expectations, with 243 of our planned 280 net wells completed during the first half. We produced more than the high end of our U.S. production forecast for all commodities due to the outperformance from premium wells drilled throughout the first half of the year. On the capital side, we continue to see fantastic cost reduction in all our active basins. At the start of the year, we expected well costs in 2017 to at least remain flat as we were confident we could offset any exposure to inflation. However, we were also optimistic we could further reduce costs, so we establish stretch targets. Year-to-date, we\u2019re on track to reach those targets in every major basin. During the first quarter, we met and reset our 2017 Delaware Basin well cost target, which we now met again during the second quarter. We\u2019ve also met our Powder River Basin well cost target. And we exceeded our DJ Basin cost target by 10-plus percent. These cost savings are not a result of any one thing; they are a combination of everything. With our pleased but not-satisfied culture, EOG records are broken regularly. We all -- we are also keeping tight control of our operating expenses. We\u2019ve offset any exposure to service cost inflation as well as increased costs associated with higher levels of activity. Ongoing cost reductions driven by the scale of our operations and other efficiencies have kept lease operating expenses flat quarter-to-quarter and down on a per-unit basis as we have successfully controlled LOE while increasing production. For the remainder of the year, we expect per-unit LOE will decline reflecting the sustainable nature of the cost savings and efficiency gains EOG realized over the last 2 years. As a result of well outperformance, we are increasing our forecast for 2017 U.S. oil production growth to 20% without increasing the number of wells completed or our capital expenditure forecast. Our performance year-to-date truly reflects the power of our premium drilling strategy. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Sandeep Bhakhri for a technology update. Sandeep Bhakhri : Thanks, Gary. In our last earnings call, we highlighted how real-time data from our proprietary black boxes and our custom-developed mobile applications are a major productivity game changer. Last quarter, we showcased our proprietary real-time geosteering app, iSteer. This morning, [indiscernible] two new recentric [ph] apps we recently rolled out to our team in the Delaware Basin, and how they\u2019re already making an impact. These tools were designed and customized with input from the entire drilling team, from the engineers in the office to the rig personnel on site. The entire team has access to more than 80 real-time data streams from advanced downhole instruments alongside instant access to data from previously drilled offset [indiscernible]. Drilling engineers and on-site rig personnel can analyze performance of bits and motors, as well as results from real-time predictive algorithms that project bit location and orientation to make real-time decisions. The whole team can look at real-time drilling projects in terms of days versus depth, depth versus cost, et cetera. It\u2019s like having a real-time report card. The bottom line is that our drilling engineers and rig personnel are in lock step evaluating drilling performance versus their best offset wells. And all this analysis then goes into making the next well even better. Furthermore, the apps allow access to all these features anytime and anywhere. As an example on the New Mexico Wolfcamp [row] we recently drilled last month. Our company man on location called the well\u2019s drilling engineer requesting to pull a drill bit. The drilling engineering who was out of the office at that time used his mobile app to quickly analyze their plan and determine that [tripping] for a new bit wasn\u2019t needed in that particular interval of rock and would only add extra cost. With both the company man and the drilling engineer viewing the analysis real time, they decided not to [trip]. They drilled a vertical with one less assembly saving a day of drilling time and an estimated $100,000 for the interval. This improved performance in the vertical contributed to a drilling record for the New Mexico Wolfcamp, 17,000 feet in 10 days. Given the [indiscernible] of [80] off the rocks in the Delaware Basin, the ability for our drilling team to react instantly to changes compared to the initial plan is critical for the superior well results that Gary just spoke about. I can\u2019t emphasize enough that EOG\u2019s quantity, quality and breadth of data drives our information technology advantage. First, we believe we have multiple times more data on horizontal oil wells than anyone in the industry. More importantly, the data is proprietary. The type and granularity of data and the frequency of collection is customized to our needs. Second, we are constantly experimenting and applying and learning to the next well. EOG\u2019s cultures is to always question and push the envelope on what can be done. The result is terabytes of differentiated data capturing results of thousands and thousands of experiments. The application they\u2019ve built in-house analyzed and delivered all the data real time better than any other comparables suite of applications in the industry. However, these applications are virtually useless without the big data and the culture of experimentation and innovation you need to drive data science in the first place. Thank you, and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Billy Helms who will update you on the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin claims. Billy Helms : Thanks, Sandeep. In the Eagle Ford, the average 30-day initial oil production rate from the 51 wells completed during the second quarter was about 1,500 barrels per day. This well performance marks a return to the productivity levels from last year before we began completing the older drilled but uncompleted wells or DUCs remaining in our working inventory. Many of the DUCs completed during the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of this year were drilled in 2015 prior to our more recent advancements in targeting. These latest Eagle Ford wells really demonstrate the impact that precision targeting makes on well performance. Successfully steering the lateral into the 10 or 20 feet of the highest quality pay of any given target can significantly enhance the well\u2019s ability to achieve EOG\u2019s premium drilling hurdle. From an operations perspective, this was a quarter of solid execution. We maintained and in some cases continued to lower completed well costs averaging just $4.5 million for a 5,300-foot lateral during the first half of this year. We are well on our way to reaching our year-end target of $4.3 million per well. The Delaware Basin continues to deliver outstanding well performance in multiple target horizons. In the second quarter, we completed 25 wells in the Wolfcamp and 19 wells in the Bone Springs. In the Wolfcamp, we are delineating in three different areas, two in the oil window and one in the combo area and testing various spacing distances between wells. Our first highlight, a four-well package drilled in Southern Lea County. The Rattlesnake wells are 660 feet apart and average 30-day IPs over 2,500 barrels of oil per day each from laterals that averaged about 6,700 feet. These wells complete a full section developed with eight wells per section in this Upper Wolfcamp interval. While early in the productive life of these wells, we are encouraged about the performance of the spacing pattern. A second four-well package, the Whitney Bronson wells was drilled in the oil window in Loving County with 440 feet between wells. These wells averaged 30-day IPs at 2,250 barrels of oil per day each from laterals that averaged about 9,500 feet. The third package is a three-well pattern in the combo portion of the play. The State Street 20-29 wells in the State Apache 57 number 1610H. These wells averaged 30-day IPs of 3,250 barrels of oil equivalent per day each, with a 49% oil cut and laterals that average 7,200 feet. In total, the average 30 day production rate from the 25 wells completed in the Wolfcamp is over 1,900 barrels of oil per day or 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day including both the oil window and combo portions of the play. Like the Wolfcamp, we continue to test longer laterals in the Bone Springs. We completed a three well package, the Neptune 10 State Com 503H-505 H that averaged 30-day IPs at nearly 2,800 barrels of oil per day each with laterals of 9,700 feet. In total, the 19 wells completed in the Bone Springs in the second quarter averaged over 1,500 barrels of oil per day. Our development plan includes delineation of our acreage along with determining the proper wells spacing for the various target intervals. Our program continues to deliver results that exceed our reasonable expectations. We are still in the early innings of determining the full long-term potential of this world-class play. While early at this juncture, we are seeing that the sweet spots for each target interval are highly dependent on the stratigraphic nature of the intervals and not laterally extensive across the entire basin. Next up is Lance Terveen to provide details of our plans for takeaway capacity in the Delaware Basin. Lance Terveen : Thanks, Billy, and good morning, everyone. The industry has been focused on Delaware Basin takeaway for crude oil, plant processing and residue gas. Securing access to multiple markets and capacity options in 2018, 2019 and 2020 has been a key focus for our team. We\u2019ve been successful diversifying our transportation options and sales points, so that marketing our Delaware Basin production will be as flexible as the optionality we built for our Bakken and our Eagle Ford production. Starting with crude. EOG capacity on a new third party Delaware Basin oil gathering system and terminal is on schedule for start-up in early 2018. This new system will deliver substantial cost savings and more importantly will give us three direct connections to takeaway pipelines with access to Cushing, Corpus and Houston markets along with the option to export our crude oil. Between our oil transportation agreements in place and our recent Mid-Cush Basis Swap positions, we\u2019ve created security to market and minimized Mid-Cush Basis exposure. For natural gas, our Midland team has done a tremendous job, building out EOG-owned gas gathering and compression infrastructure. Our systems tie directly into multiple plants throughout the entire Delaware Basin. As we added to our plant processing capacity, we also ensure we have multiple options for residue gas take away from the Permian Basin. Through our existing agreements and soon-to-be-executed transactions with our strong midstream counterparties, EOG will be well insulated and protected during the most at-risk years of capacity concerns and volatility. Now here\u2019s David Trice. David Trice : Thanks, Lance. We continue to drill very prolific highly economic wells in the South Texas Austin Chalk. In the second quarter, we completed nine wells with a 30 day average IP rate of over 2,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day each from an average treated lateral of less than 4,000 feet. The average well cost for these short laterals was just $4.6 million. Spacing varies but, in general, the recent wells average about 600 feet between laterals. We continue to test tighter spacing and lateral placement within the various Austin Chalk targets we are testing. More to come on this in the future. In our Bakken and Three Forks asset, well performance during the second quarter improved significantly. Much like the Eagle Ford towards the end of 2016 and into the first half of this year, we completed the remaining well inventory from 2014 and 2015. Those pre 2016 DUCs did not benefit from the more recent advancements in precision targeting used on our current working inventory of wells. Going forward, we have essentially depleted our Bakken DUC inventory, but the newly drilled Bakken wells will have the benefit of the latest precision targeting. Our 30 day average oil IP in the Bakken this quarter was almost 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The Clark\u2019s Creek package and the Antelope Extension Area is particularly notable. The top-performing Bakken well in this package posted almost 3,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the first 30 days. Also included in the Clark\u2019s Creek package was the Three Forks well. Its 30-day IP averaged over 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the Powder River Basin, we completed 8 Turner wells during the second quarter. These wells came online with 30 day rates of over 1,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day each from an average treated lateral of 8,700 feet. We continue to see upside in our large 400,000 acre provision on the Powder River Basin and are pursuing block up trades throughout the basin. In Trinidad, we\u2019re happy to announce we finalized an agreement with the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago. The NGC and EOG agreed to a multiyear gas supply contract that will support a substantial drilling program and EOG\u2019s ongoing exploration efforts. As mentioned last quarter, we recently completed a newly joint venture seismic survey and are planning to acquire another proprietary seismic survey next year. Both of these surveys are state-of-the-art and will greatly enhance our exploration and development activities in offshore Trinidad. In the second quarter, we drilled one new well in Trinidad and anticipate drilling at least three more wells in the second half of the year. With the new gas supply contract and new seismic data, we expect future EOG Trinidad projects to be economically competitive with our best onshore U.S. assets. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure. Tim Driggers : Thanks, Randy. We are maintaining a full year 2017 capital expenditure guidance at $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion. During the second quarter, we are on track, investing approximately one half of that amount. Total exploration and development expenditures in the second quarter were $1 billion including facilities of $161 million and excluding acquisitions, non-cash property exchanges and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $56 million. Capitalized interest for the second quarter was $7 million. At quarter end, total debt outstanding was $7 billion for a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 33%. Considering $1.6 billion in cash at hand, June 30, net-debt-to-total capital was 28%. In the second quarter of 2017, total impairments were $79 million. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 63%. And the deferred tax ratio was 87%. Now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Bill. Bill Thomas : Thanks, Tim. In closing, I will leave you with a few important points. First, our premium drilling strategy is delivering better than expected well results. In the Permian, Eagle Ford and Rockies, EOG\u2019s wells are some of the best in the industry allowing the company to exceed production targets with record capital efficiency. Second, we continue to lower well costs and operating costs. EOG\u2019s cost-reduction culture leveraging sustainable technology and efficiency gains coupled with self-sourced materials and services continues to offset upward industry service costs. Third, EOG remains committed to capital discipline. We are on track to deliver cash flow at or above CapEx and the dividend into 2017.  Fourth, we are engaged in a robust exploration effort using our extensive historical database and experience. We are focused on capturing high-quality rock and the sweet spot of new premium plays with strong leasing efforts underway this year. And finally, we believe we\u2019re generating the highest investment returns in the U.S. and adding the lowest cost reserves. Our number one goal is getting ROCE back to our historical average of 13% or better, and creating sustainable long-term shareholder value. Thanks for listening, and now we\u2019ll go to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go to Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio : Maybe I\u2019ll start off with the incremental update in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford where you witnessed a normalized IP, 30 IPs, up by 30% in the Eagle Ford, and you doubled them in the Bakken. Can you provide color on what drove the change? Is it the shift away from DUCs, I think, you alluded to in the Bakken and into premium inventory or completion design specifics? Billy Helms : Yes. Evan, this is Billy Helms. I\u2019ll start and maybe David Trice can add some color also. For the Eagle Ford, in particular, it was driven largely by our moving towards new drilled wells, getting away from the DUCs and taking advantage of our new steering technology that we kind of developed to identify the best rock and then steer the well in the best 10 or 20 feet of that rock. As we mentioned in all these plays, the rock quality makes a huge difference in the productivity of each play. And we\u2019re taking the advantage of that this year. In the previous quarters -- the previous two quarters were driven largely by drilling or completing wells that did not take advantage of this new steering technology. So moving away from those and moving into a more -- a program more focused on the new advances in steering is what led to the improvements in the Eagle Ford. David? David Trice : Yes. This is David Trice. The Bakken is a very similar story. So we -- like I mentioned, we did, in the first half of this year, finish off pretty much all the DUCs in the Bakken. And a lot of these DUCs were drilled going back as far as 2014. So we\u2019ve come a long, long way in the last 2 or 3 years on both targeting in the Bakken and in completions. And just understanding the interaction between the geology and the completion in the Bakken, because it is a -- you do see variations across the Bakken in the geology. And so you have to be able to match your completion and the timing of your completions to the geology. So that\u2019s the biggest thing that we\u2019ve seen as we\u2019ve finished off those DUCs and starting completing some of the new drill, like the package that we announced that had such prolific results of -- in the Clark\u2019s Creeks. So those are some new drill wells and so that shows the potential [indiscernible] return in the Bakken. Evan Calio : My second, if I stay on the Eagle Ford, on a normalized basis here, Austin Chalk wells are performing -- outperforming Eagle Ford wells by over two times in the last three quarters, it sounds like that outperformance is representative of development spacing. Just given what you\u2019ve seen, what\u2019s the consideration to progressing the Austin Chalk to full development mode? Or can you talk about kind of considerations there? David Trice : On the Austin Chalk, the main driver for the outperformance there is the reservoir quality. The reservoir quality of the Austin Chalk is superior to that of the Eagle Ford. And -- but a lot of the information we\u2019ve collected over the years in the Eagle Ford that\u2019s been applied to the Austin Chalk. So we\u2019ve been able to basically take better rock and apply more advanced completions to better rock. As far as any updates on resource potential or anything like that, we\u2019re still testing spacing patterns and various targets. We do see multiple targets in the Austin Chalk, similar to what we see in the Eagle Ford. But the geology is a little bit more complex. These aren\u2019t -- the Austin Chalk is not exactly the same as a shale-type resourcing play. So we need to continue to collect more [indiscernible] data and get some additional target tests and as well as spacing tests before we can come up with any sort of resource update. Operator : And we\u2019ll next go to Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer : With your recount higher -- with the recount higher across shale, not just for EOG but for industry, expectations from many are that we\u2019re seeing -- or we\u2019re going to see industry cost inflation. But as you highlighted, you\u2019re still expecting well costs to fall in areas like the Eagle Ford. Are you not seeing the inflation? Or are you seeing it and more than offsetting it? And in a place like the Eagle Ford, can you talk to what represents the $0.2 million in well cost reduction you expect? And if there\u2019s any offsetting impact in terms of what that well and its productivity look like? Gary Thomas : Yes, we\u2019re seeing some inflation on costs and not different than maybe we mentioned last quarter. It\u2019s in that 10% to 15% range. A large part of our costs are pretty well fixed. We\u2019ve got our drilling rigs probably 60% locked in. We\u2019ve got our frac fleets about close to the same. We\u2019re very fortunate to have these state-of-art rigs. And we are just offsetting the cost inflation with improved technology and the design of bits, design of motors. We have our engineers doing both of those. We\u2019ve got our own mud systems and mud engineers. So we\u2019re working those as well. So that along with [indiscernible] just these proprietary systems that Sandeep\u2019s highlighted, that\u2019s just given us greater confidence in further reducing our costs. We reduced our costs last year in that 15% to 30%, maybe an average of 20%. We think we\u2019ll get to that 10% reduction again this year. Brian Singer : Great, great. And then my follow up is with regards to well performance. As you see wells outperform, and the improvement in 30 day rates in the Bakken and Eagle Ford was already noted, to what degree should we expect higher EURs from these wells, i.e., if we see that, hey, you\u2019ve got almost double your 30 day oil IP in the Bakken, what type of EUR improvement should that lead to based on the knowledge in your reservoir modeling? Billy Helms : Yes, Brian, this is Billy Helms. Yes, we\u2019re seeing that -- really the shift to premium has made a huge difference on not only initial production rate but the ultimate recovery we expect from each one of these plays. So you\u2019re right, in general, as time goes on, we\u2019re pleasantly surprised at the uplift we\u2019re seeing in both production and EUR from the plays. And it all gets back to, as Bill and Dave described earlier, the quality of the rock. And of course, all that is driving our finding costs lower, which will ultimately lead to driving our DD&A rate down over time, which is the focus, as Bill mentioned, the focus of the company is getting back to our double-digit ROCEs. So that\u2019s the focus. And it really ties back to focusing on the quality of the rock. That makes all the difference in the world. Brian Singer : I guess, is there a portion of the increase in 30-day well performance that represents greater depletion as opposed or quicker depletion as a result to it\u2019s all EUR? Or should we assume the same percentage improvement in EUR as we see improvement in 30 day well performance? Billy Helms : Yes, Brian. This is Billy Helms, again. Yes, I think it\u2019s not always directly proportional, the IP and the EUR. What we\u2019re seeing is longer laterals oftentimes have a little bit suppressed IP relative to shorter laterals just on a length basis. But ultimately the EUR is increasing proportionately to lateral length, and that was a big focus for the company earlier in the year as we tried to go to longer laterals to make sure that our EUR per foot stayed pretty much the same as our previous wells. What we are seeing is just to take that to a next step further, I think by focusing on the quality of the rock and the steering and keeping it in that best rock, in general, the EUR is improving with time relative to the previous non-steered wells. So you\u2019ve got multiple factors there that are working together to give us better results. It\u2019s hard to give you an exact percentage of uplift on IP to EUR, because each plays is a little bit different. But in general, they are going up. Operator : And we\u2019ll next go to Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Bill, I wonder if I could just start off, actually, with something of a macro question. You\u2019ve kept Slide 26 in your deck, which talks about the new marginal cost of oil at $65 to $75. And I think, obviously, there\u2019s probably some question marks around that right now. What I\u2019m really getting at is your $50 to $60 range for your 15% to 25% growth rate in oil, how are you thinking about that longer term given that, I\u2019m guessing, you\u2019re probably thinking about resetting that Slide 26 deck as well as everybody else? And I\u2019ve got a follow up, please. Bill Thomas : Yes, at this moment, Doug, we\u2019re not ready to change that guidance. We want to get more well -- well results and see how we line up here. But in general, we feel like our capital efficiency is going up, so we\u2019re able to add more oil with lower cost all the time. And certainly, our breakeven costs are continuing to go down. On that chart you mentioned we\u2019re at 10% -- to get a 10% return, it would take a $30 oil price. And over time, we\u2019ll reevaluate that as we get better. Doug Leggate : So I guess, it was probably a little bit obtuse question because I guess, what I was really hoping to get out of it was it seems to us that because your well results continue to get better, particularly in Eagle Ford, that 15% to 25% range, the $50 to $60 number has probably come down some. I guess what I\u2019m really trying to get at is are you ready to give us the new deck where you can still achieve that 15% to 25% at $5 lower, for example? Bill Thomas : Doug, Yes. No, we\u2019re not ready yet to do that. We want to get more data and more time and really make sure that we\u2019re not jumping the gun on that. And -- but certainly, our exploration effort is a big focus for the company. And we\u2019re continuing to look for better and better rock all the time. And as that plays out, as we continue to increase productivity in the existing plays, et cetera, et cetera, we\u2019ll take all that in consideration and update when we feel the right time is. Doug Leggate : So hopefully that was my first mission. My follow up is, hopefully, a bit quicker. I\u2019m going to take advantage of the fact that you were talking a little bit about the big data again on the call this morning. And really it relates to your exploration efforts. And my question is really about, can you kind of characterize for us, just at a fairly high level, when you\u2019re entering a new play, to what extent is your data set and your data analytics allowing you to almost explore in a play before you drill the well? In other words, high grade the assessment before you actually go in and spend some real money. And I\u2019m just -- in the context of business development because you mentioned that on the call again this morning, I know it\u2019s pretty high level, but I\u2019ll leave there. Bill Thomas : Yes, that\u2019s certainly an important point. We have multi decades of trial and error and multi decades of core data. And of course, we\u2019ve developed our own proprietary petrophysical models to go along with that core data and multi decades of experimentation with the different types of completion technology. So we have all that data. We incorporate that into each kind of rock type that we\u2019ve tested. And we have learned probably more about how horizontal technology affects tight rocks, particularly in plays of rocks that are non shale, in the last couple of years than we\u2019ve learned in the last 10 years.  So it\u2019s been a very steep learning curve in the last few years. And that preparatory knowledge we were taking this year in a very robust manner to look for new plays. And we believe we have a lead on the industry. And we have a unique opportunity window, particularly this year, to add additional acreage in those kinds of plays. And so we\u2019re -- we have increased exploration spending this year to do that. And so the whole process of gathering that data, collecting that data and analyzing that data has been a huge part of that, and we\u2019re taking that advantage and using it this year. Operator : We\u2019ll next go to Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey : You\u2019ve got loads of good charts there showing how you\u2019ve got great production growth and cost gains and all the rest of it, but I do notice that your return on capital employed graphic doesn\u2019t have a scale. And further to that I was wondering, and I think my preference is, if I could give you one, would be that you had a rapidly rising return above, perhaps, a little bit less growth, So just a couple of things. First, I\u2019m a bit bewildered by the sheer number of premium locations you\u2019re adding because the inventory is now getting so long, I\u2019m not sure why you would keep adding them unless you\u2019re going to tighten the definition of premium location. And secondly, could we get to a point where you actually begin to aggressively pursue returns growth at $50 a barrel? Bill Thomas : Yes, Paul. The Slide 7 that I referred to in the script is, I think, an attempt to kind of address some of the questions that you\u2019ve brought up. The premium finding cost is roughly half of what the non-premium is. And so as we continue to focus on premium, we\u2019re about -- last year, we were 50%, this year, we\u2019re 80%. Next year, we\u2019re projecting that 90% of our wells will be premium. And adding that premium finding cost as quickly as possible is very, very important to changing the cost basis of the company. And so higher growth with premium wells will drive the DD&A rate down quicker and help us to generate ROCE numbers more quickly over time. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on, and we\u2019re focused on doing that with a disciplined cash flow -- spending within cash flow. So we\u2019re adding the premium well reserves as fast as possible within cash flow and that -- and we\u2019re also, of course, focused on cash operating costs. Those are a big part of earnings, too. So -- but again, adding those premium and adding that to the cost basis as quickly as possible within cash flow is the focus, and that\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to get there. Paul Sankey : I guess, my question is, what is there? So are we looking at a double-digit return on capital employed by 2020 at $50 oil? Can you be more specific? Bill Thomas : Well, we believe that you can get to double digits at $50, but it will take a bit of time. And we\u2019re a bit hesitant to project the amount of time. It will do that but certainly, directionally, that\u2019s possible, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed. Paul Sankey : Yes, I just think it would be very differentiated if you could achieve that because we haven\u2019t had a history in this industry of returns priority at the same time as the kind of growth that you\u2019re offering. And I think for a company of your scale, once you get to 15% and 20% compound growth in volumes, I\u2019m not sure why you would want to go faster than that. Is that fair? Bill Thomas : Well, I think the important part of growth now within cash flow as fast as possible is adding those low cost reserves as fast as possible -- so within cash flow. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re really focused on. I think it\u2019s very important to note that these finding costs for these premium wells that we\u2019re drilling are quite substantially much, much better than the rest of the industry. So if we\u2019re growing faster than the industry, and these are the best wells, the lowest finding costs in the industry, then our ROCE should recover much quickly than the industry. Paul Sankey : If you don\u2019t mind, there\u2019s a tremendous amount of controversy. If we could look back a little bit at the performance of your wells and the decline rate. Today, there\u2019s a lot of controversy and a new buzz phrase is bubble point. Are you seeing more gas and anything in the decline rates that you\u2019re getting that give rise to any kind of concern about the base that you\u2019re dealing with? And I\u2019ll leave it there. Billy Helms : Yes, Paul, this is Billy Helms. Yes, let me first start off by reminding everybody that we drilled over 5,000 horizontal oil wells in multiple basins, different plays, different target intervals and, more importantly, different rock types. As we\u2019ve mentioned, the quality of the rock is extremely important, not only in their recovery but also in how the gas breaks out of solution. So there\u2019s a lot of things that go into determining the GOR -- lifetime GOR for the play, and we take a particular note of that. And with our history and all the data we\u2019ve collected, we have a lot of insight into what drives that. Of course, in particular, in the Delaware Basin, it\u2019s highly over-pressured. And -- is one point, but also the type of rock we drill in and the core size that each rock type has also drives the GOR. So those are important points to make. Having said all that, what we are seeing is that the performance of our wells is adhering very well to the type curves that we use to build our forecasts on. And we\u2019re not seeing a degradation in reserves or break out of gas over and above what we\u2019ve already forecast. So I\u2019d say, our wells are performing as we built our type curves, either performing or exceeding our type curves in most cases. Operator : And we\u2019ll next go to Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : I wondered if I could go back to some of Gary\u2019s prepared comments and make sure I heard them correctly and interpreted them well. Gary, did I hear properly that, for the first half of \u201817, you completed 243 wells versus the plan of 280? And if that is right, I guess it would make your first half performance even more impressive. And is there a catch up that you have planned in the back half of \u201817? Gary Thomas : No, Charles. Sorry, but I didn\u2019t speak clearly. We\u2019ve completed 243 net wells of the planned 480 net for 2017. So we\u2019re about halfway there. Charles Meade : And then a second thing, if I could ask about the Neptune wells that Billy Helms spoke about. And I guess, the question is, are those the same Neptune wells that made the appearance on your list of the top 16 of the 20 wells by peak oil month. And if they are, those are Bone Springs wells, does that indicate a possible step change in what you\u2019re seeing in the Bone Springs? Billy Helms : Yes, Charles. This is Billy Helms. Those Neptune wells are the Bone Springs wells. And we are seeing some really outstanding performance in Bone Springs. And as you know, generally, we\u2019ve typically been drilling the Wolfcamp intervals first, mainly because it\u2019s deeper. It\u2019s also highly productive but deeper. And it gives us a lot of the insight into geologically what\u2019s happening in the Bone Springs. And these wells are drilled using that knowledge, but also the targeting technology that we\u2019ve gained. So we\u2019re getting some outstanding results from those wells. Charles Meade : Does that change? I mean, I think everything else on that list of those top wells is all -- I think most impressive is Wolfcamp. Is this a step-change that Bone Springs could maybe be half [indiscernible]? Billy Helms : Yes, I think the Bone Springs is meeting or exceeding our expectations. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a step-change in what we thought. We\u2019ve always recognized the Bone Springs as a highly prolific zone. I think what you\u2019re seeing is, this year, we are completing more than we had in previous years. And it does get down to the rock quality and how you select your targets, and those improvements that we made in that. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything that we didn\u2019t expect to have happen. I think the Bone Springs is highly prolific. But having said that, I think the Bone Springs -- important to also say, the Bone Springs is a highly stratigraphic play. And it\u2019s not going to be the same everywhere. So you can\u2019t extrapolate the results across the entire basin. And I think I made that point in the opening comments is every one of these play intervals are unique to a certain area. And you can\u2019t expect results across the entire basin similar to these wells. Operator : We\u2019ll next go Bob Morris of Citi. With no response, we\u2019ll move on to Paul Grigel of Macquarie. Paul Grigel : Focusing in on the takeaway comments you made, specific on the Delaware Basin, starting with natural gas there. Can you provide more detail on what some of those key takeaway points are that you\u2019re looking at outside of the basin once you\u2019ve gathered the gas on your system? Lance Terveen : Paul, its Lance. To us, the most important thing is diversification. So we hold some legacy transport that goes to the Southern California and Arizona markets. We\u2019ve also [indiscernible] in capacity to the Gulf Coast. So as you think about the capacity, and we talked about the plant capacity, we\u2019ll have transportation that goes all the way kind of into the Waha Hub. And then from there, we have takeaway that can go into either one of those the markets, whether it\u2019s in the Sou Cal, Phoenix markets and also into the Gulf Coast. Paul Grigel : And that\u2019s firm capacity that you guys actually either have ownership or have control over? Lance Terveen : Yes, sir. Paul Grigel : Okay. And then, I guess, turning onto oil on the takeaway capacity from the Permian as well. A two part one, just one, as you guys look at new options coming on? Do you see it happening in, you mentioned early \u201818? Is there a continued growth through \u201818 that you see you can get on? And then second, with the addition of the mid Cush differentials that you guys examined there, how does that fit into both the broader takeaway strategy, but then also into a broader hedging strategy, given 2018 doesn\u2019t have any oil hedges at this point in time, what would you guys need to see there? Lance Terveen : Yes, I mean, the President mentioned in the prepared comments, we\u2019re going to have the optionality to go to all the markets on the Gulf. Whether -- we have transportation and we\u2019re going to hum going through Corpus, going through Cushing and also into the Houston markets. But what you\u2019re seeing with the Mid Cush Basis Swaps, that\u2019s really just complementing our transportation capacity that we have. So the way we think about that, we\u2019ve got a certain amount of production that we sell at the lease. We also sell to local refiners that are in that area. They\u2019re very good customers. So we\u2019re going to always continue to have sales in Midland kind of based off the Mid-Cush index. So we just felt that the Mid Cush Basis Swaps were just very complementary to our transportation. And really, when you think about it, I mean, a dollar back of WTI, what you\u2019re starting to even see today, even when you look at September, it\u2019s trading more than $1.50 back. So -- which is [Indiscernible] as being very prudent to have some protection on a portion of the volumes that we\u2019re going to have left in the Midland market. Paul Grigel : Okay, and how does that -- and maybe this is for Tim, but how does that fit into the broader hedging strategy just on crude overall for you guys? Or how do you think about that at this point in time? Gary Thomas : Yes, Paul. We always just look at that on a going forward opportunistic basis, and we\u2019re -- fundamentally, what we see in the numbers is the market is still too bearish and the forward curve is flattish at best. So we\u2019ll just continue to watch it over time. We would love to have up to 50% of our oil heads going into 2018, but we\u2019ll just have to kind of look and see what the fundamentals are telling us and then make those decisions as we see opportunities arise. Operator : We\u2019ll go to James Sullivan of Alembic Global Advisors. James Sullivan : You guys went through this kind of basin by basin in the prepared remarks, but are you -- could you just, kind of a housekeeping, quantify the percentage or the number of total wells turned in line in the first half that were vintage DUCs. Just trying to figure out the percentage of not -- of wells those are not drilled with the new technology that were contributing to first half? Bill Thomas : The number of completions that we brought on were 233. It\u2019s probably roughly 25% of the wells in the first half were DUCs. James Sullivan : Okay. Great. That\u2019s perfect, just what I was looking for. And then second question was a little bit of a macro topic, I was wondering if I could pick your brain on this, given your market knowledge. And the topic is the average API gravity will be produced, especially out of these growth, unconventional basins and this kind of hasn\u2019t been talked about much. You guys talked about it back in 2013 to make the point that you were producing black oil, while others in the Eagle Ford were largely producing condensate-range material. That issue has kind of gone away with the up and down in unconventional budgeting since the oil swoon here and with the lifting of the export ban. And I know you guys don\u2019t produce -- participate really in the crude export market, but can you characterize whether you, at all, foresee a problem marketing, and let\u2019s just choose a gravity like incremental 45-degree API gravity oil, in the Gulf Coast in the next 2 years? Is this a problem that\u2019s on your radar at all? Or are you not worried about it? Lance Terveen : James, this is Lance. We feel like we\u2019ve always been a first mover, whether in the Bakken and also in the Eagle Ford, segregating our crude. But when you look at the Delaware Basin, what we\u2019re seeing with the gathering system and the terminal that we\u2019re going to have, we\u2019re going to be able to keep our crude segregated or move it. And what you\u2019re seeing from a lot of the midstream companies is end segregations. We\u2019re not going to see any degradation that we\u2019re seeing today in terms of how you think about it an API quality, whether it\u2019s a $45 to a $50, we\u2019re not seeing any of that downstream. Operator : We\u2019ll go to David Heikkinen of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. David Heikkinen : We\u2019ve been thinking a lot more about how investors can see your results flow into really upstream financial reporting. You just kind of hit on the capital employed that\u2019s holding back double-digit returns because of the base. Can you talk about, maybe by the end of \u201818, how much of your base will be premium locations with those lower [F&B] and better return? Bill Thomas : David, the I don\u2019t think we have a number that we can give you other than to say that, as oil prices and cash flow improve, we\u2019ll be able to drill more wells. And as our capital efficiency improves, we\u2019ll be able to drill more wells. And then next year, the percent of premium wells goes from 80% this year to 90% next year. So we\u2019ll just have more and more premium wells every year as we go forward. And that isn\u2019t really, as you noted, that\u2019s important to changing our cost basis, getting those low-cost finding cost reserves into our base. David Heikkinen : Maybe another way to look that we\u2019ve been thinking about is in your reserve report. The 2016 and 2017 premium locations, will we see an improvement in additions and revisions or mainly additions? Bill Thomas : Mainly, yes. David, it will be mainly in additions. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see a lot of revisions. We don\u2019t expect any major revisions. I think you\u2019ll see mainly additions from the new adds continuing to increase. I think the other way to think about that, too, is the overall company production base will become larger, made up -- more largely made up of the volume from the new programs and certainly that\u2019ll help drive returns as well. David Heikkinen : Just one more question on this, I really do appreciate it. And then on the future development costs given you guys have had a trend of sustainably lowering well costs, should we see a downward trend on future development costs on your reserve report? Bill Thomas : Yes, I would think so. I think you would see that start to affect our reserve report over time as well. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I will now hand back to Mr. Thomas for any closing remarks. Bill Thomas : Thank you. In closing, our second quarter results were outstanding due to the excellent work by every EOG employee, and we certainly thank each one of them. And we look forward to continuing to lowering costs, improving well productivity and testing new plays in the second half of this year. We\u2019re laser focused on adding low cost reserves within cash flow to improve EOG\u2019s bottom line and to create long-term shareholder value. So thanks for listening, and thanks for your support. Operator : And that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We thank you all for participating. Have a great day.",

Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the EOG Resources Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir. Timothy K. Driggers - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing third quarter 2017 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risk associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves and other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release. Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Gary Thomas, President and Chief Operating Officer; Billy Helms, EVP, Exploration and Production; David Trice, EVP Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing Operations; Sandeep Bhakhri, Senior VP and Chief Information and Technology Officer; David Streit, VP, Investor and Public Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening and we included guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 in yesterday's press release. This morning, we'll discuss topics in the following order : Bill Thomas will review third quarter highlights, followed by operational results from Gary Thomas, David Trice and Billy Helms. I will discuss EOG's financials and capital structure, and Bill will provide concluding remarks. Here's Bill Thomas. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. EOG is focused on returns. We demonstrate that focus in the third quarter. We added two new premium oil plays, continued cost reductions and delivered strong well performance. The Woodford oil window in the Anadarko Basin and the First Bone Spring in the Delaware Basin add 800 premium drilling locations and 750 million barrels of oil equivalent resource potential net to EOG. As a reminder, for a well to be classified premium, it must have an after-tax rate of return of 30% or greater at $40 oil. Combined with additions made earlier in the year, we have increased our premium inventory by 2,000 locations, which is four times as many wells as we planned to complete in 2017. EOG continues to improve both the size and the quality of its inventory, organically adding better and better locations, substantially faster than our drilling pace. Strong operational execution was also highlighted from the quarter. We exceeded all our production targets and we delivered beyond expectations across all per- unit costs : LOE, transportation expense and DD&A. Our 2017 plan is coming together nicely. We're on target to deliver 20% oil growth and pay the dividend all within cash flow. This morning, I'd like to take a moment to discuss EOG's multi-basin premium portfolio. As we've discussed many times before, the most important point to understand about exploration is that not all rocks are equal. Every play has geologic sweet spots, with superior rock quality that drives well productivity. We do not want to own the whole play. Our focus is to capture only the best rock in the best plays. We did that in the Bakken in 2005, we did it again in the Eagle Ford in 2009, and last year we solidified sweet spot acreage in the Delaware and Powder River Basin with the Yates acquisition. Our ability to identify and capture the best rock is the major reason EOG wells consistently outperform the industry in productivity and returns. With the addition of the Woodford oil window in the First Bone Spring, our premium inventory now totals a massive 8,000 crude oil drilling locations contained in geologic sweet spots across all six major horizontal oil plays. We don't think there's another company in the U.S. with comparable assets. Specifically, the enormous size and quality of EOG's premium inventory. This premium inventory will fuel EOG's industry-leading returns for many years to come. The diversity of our portfolio is a powerful competitive advantage with multiple benefits. One is that single-basin risk is minimized. EOG is active across multiple basins, therefore, temporary conditions in a single basin, such as market tightness or weather event will have limited impact on our performance. Additionally, EOG's diverse multi-basin portfolio allows the company to grow each asset at the optimum pace to maximize its profitability and long-term value. Each play is unique and has a technical and cost optimization learning curve. It's easy to go too fast and potentially risk the long-term value of asset. There are two other points I want to drive home this morning. First is that our decentralized structure was instrumental to accumulating the premium portfolio we have today, and will continue to be critical to our success in the future. We have seven teams operating in North America. These are dedicated individual offices covering every major basin and specializing in each play. That means seven prospect-generating machines and seven cost-savings idea teams, focused team dedicated to each asset armed with our powerful information technology, drive down costs, increase well productivity and maximize the value of each play. Exploring rock and developing wells in multiple diverse basins means generating multiple sets of diverse data. While each play is unique, geologic learnings and technical innovation often transfers to other plays and in turn accelerates the pace of learning across all basins. The final point I want to make is that since our formation, EOG has been a return-incentivized company. Last quarter, we discussed EOG's history of disciplined, return-based capital allocation. The capital discipline this company has demonstrated since its founding is driven by a transparent return-based incentive structure that runs through the entire organization. Evidence of that discipline can be calculated directly from our financial statements as return on capital employed. Our historic ROCE performance averages over 13%. Return-based decision-making is the reason we initiated our premium strategy last year. Rather than patiently wait for commodity prices to improve and allow the cycle to drive our profitability, we permanently redefined our investment hurdle rate and reset the company to be successful in a low commodity price environment. EOG's ability to capture the best rock in multiple plays is the core reason we have been able to permanently shift to premium drilling. We believe our drilling inventory is the largest and highest quality in the U.S., and it's the reason we're able to grow U.S. oil production this year by 20% and cover the dividend all within discretionary cash flow. Most importantly, our diverse and industry-leading acreage positions are the reason we are generating the best reinvestment returns among our peers. Now I will turn it over to Gary Thomas to discuss our third quarter production and cost achievements in more detail. Gary L. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. In the third quarter, Hurricane Harvey presented EOG with a first of its kind operational challenge, one that our decentralized, multi-disciplined teams in Corpus Christi and San Antonio did an excellent job tackling. Our largest concern was the safety of our employees and facilities, and I'm happy to report we experienced no major damage or environmental incidence related to the storm. I want to thank and congratulate our employees in Corpus Christi, San Antonio and Houston for their exceptional performance during a very difficult time. During the third quarter, there were a few notable achievements to highlight. Time is money and our teams continue to reduce drilling and completion time in every play. After 10 years of drilling Eagle Ford wells, we reduced spud to TD time another 5% this year and in our newer Delaware Basin place, the wells are being drilled in 15% less time. The DD&A rate continued to decline coming in below the low end of our targeted range. The benefits of ongoing operational efficiencies, record low finding and development cost and the addition of premium well reserves are beginning to show up in our financial performance. Per-unit LOE beat expectations despite the double impact from Harvey of both cleanup and repair cost and curtailed production. As noted in the 8-K we issued September 5, the production impact of Harvey on all our oil volumes was about 15,000 barrels oil per day during the quarter. With a few adjustments to our completion schedule, we expect to offset the production impact in the fourth quarter. To accommodate the new schedule, we were able to secure additional completion crews and based on their performance and tightness in that market, we elected to tie up those crews for the remainder of this year. This was a performance and rate of return decision. As a result, we're completing approximately 25 additional wells bringing the total to 505 net completed wells for 2017. Due to the timing of the additional 25 wells late in the year, there will be a limited impact on our volumes for the full year. We now have 28 rigs working and we have the best performing services EOG has ever assembled. We do not want to release any of these top-tier service providers. The additional rigs and crews give us a head start as we plan for 2018. Due to the stellar cost savings and efficiencies gained throughout this year, we don't need to change our capital guidance. However, it is likely we will spend towards the high end of the range. EOG is one of the few E&P companies with the ability to commit capital right now, and as a result, we are securing favorable pricing agreements. We've locked in a major portion of services and suppliers to further lower cost and improve our returns in 2018. Next up is David Trice with the exciting news about our new Oklahoma play. David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Gary. This morning we introduced a new premium oil play in the Eastern Anadarko Basin. Located primarily in McClain County, Oklahoma, adjacent to the gas condensate plays properly known as the SCOOP and the STACK, the Woodford oil window is a black oil play with a concentrated sweet spot of high quality rock. Our discovery of the Eastern Anadarko-Woodford oil play is a great example how EOG's decentralized structure is a perfect fit for exploration-driven organic growth. Our team in Oklahoma City identified the potential of this area based on historical log and production data and began leasing in 2013. We accumulated our 50,000 net acre position at an average cost of just $750 per acre. Over the last four years, we collected additional data through vertical logs, core and 3D seismic to delineate the sweet spot. We were then able to compare and model this data against the vast amount of proprietary data collected in other EOG plays to determine the viability of the Woodford oil window as a premium play. Similar to the Eagle Ford, the Woodford is a shale play with very good rock quality and fairly consistent geology. We completed three horizontal wells in the Woodford oil window and applied EOG's refined targeting techniques and EOG-style completions to confirm the premium return potential of the play. The Curry 21X #1VH, which IP-ed in August, was the third well drilled and had the longest lateral at 10,500 feet. Data collected on the first two wells was used to dial in the correct target before drilling the two-mile Curry well. The average 30-day initial production was over 1,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day, while the 60-day average is holding up at over 1,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day with an oil cut of 85%. The relatively low decline is evident in the performance of all three wells drilled and speak to the premium rock quality of this sweet spot. Based on analysis of publicly available production data, we believe that the Curry is potentially the most prolific horizontal Woodford oil well drilled to-date in Oklahoma. Furthermore, the NPV on the Curry well, using the current strip, is about $10 million. So we've essentially paid for a quarter of the entire play's acreage cost with this one well. We currently estimate that EOG's position in the Woodford oil window will support 260 premium locations using 660 foot spacing. The estimated ultimate recovery is 1 million barrels equivalent per well on a gross basis and 800,000 net after royalty for a total estimated resource potential of 210 million barrels of oil equivalent, 70% of which is oil. To reiterate what Bill said earlier, we are not interested in leasing entire plays, but instead. we are focused on leasing the geologic sweet spots at low acreage costs to maximize long-term ROCE growth. The Woodford oil window in the Eastern Anadarko Basin is a perfect example of this strategy. Within EOG, all projects compete for capital, based on returns, and the Woodford oil window is more than competitive with the rest of EOG's premium inventory on a rate of return and NPV basis. Billy Helms will now tell you about the new First Bone Spring play in the Delaware Basin and provide an update on the Eagle Ford. Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, David. Our 2017 development plan in the Delaware Basin has been focused on increasing our understanding of the geological complexities of the various target intervals, testing spacing patterns and delineating our acreage position. As a result, we are providing our initial assessment of yet another target, the First Bone Spring sand. After 15 successful tests across our position, we have the confidence to define the net resource potential of 540 million barrels of oil equivalent from 555 locations, of which 540 remain to be drilled. The seven wells completed in 2017, span a distance of 30 miles and produced on average 1,825 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with initial oil cut of 66% over the first 30 days. For the play, a typical well will target 7,000 foot laterals with a well cost of $7.3 million. We estimate that EUR for a 7,000 foot lateral in the First Bone Spring sand is 1,185,000 barrels of oil equivalent, gross, and 975,000 barrels equivalent net after royalty. The oil cut through the producing life of the well is estimated at 55%. It is important to point out that all the wells in our resource estimate meet or exceed our initial premium rate of return hurdle and will compete for capital with the rest of the Delaware Basin program. Our technical team in Midland has defined multiple horizons across our acreage position and used the latest interpretation to geosteer the drill bit into the best target intervals. Targeting, along with our high-density completions, is yielding industry-leading performance, as evidenced in slide number 17 of our latest investor presentation. Our total Delaware Basin premium well inventory now stands at almost 4,700 locations, which represents over 25 years of drilling inventory at our current pace of development. For the third quarter, we completed 22 wells in the Wolfcamp Oil and Combo plays. All of the active areas continue to meet or exceed our expectations for both well performance and reserves. Out of the third quarter activity, I would like to highlight a three-well package drilled in Southern Lea County. The Antietam wells are 660 feet apart and average 30-day IPs of 2,725 barrels of oil per day each from laterals that averaged about 7,000 feet. This year has been another stellar year for the Delaware Basin team, as we explore and define the potential of this target rich area. We are advancing our development plans to address the well spacing and timing needed to maximize the net present value of this asset. We have over a decade of experience with large horizontal programs and we use this knowledge to address the challenge of developing this multi-target inventory. Once again, our culture and decentralized organization allow our technical teams to focus on these challenges in order to maximize the recovery and the economics of our acreage. We are excited about the tremendous potential we see in the basin. The Eagle Ford continues to be a consistent source for delivering both production volumes and economic reserves. In the third quarter, the average 30-day initial oil production rate from the 44 wells completed was about 1,340 barrels of oil per day, with an average well cost of $4.5 million. Acreage in the Eagle Ford is close to 99% held by production and our efforts are focused on maximizing the net present value of every acre through multi-well pad government with increasing lateral-lengths. The vast majority of the wells are drilled on larger multi-well pads which are well suited to the rigs and completion crews that allow for quick moves and efficient operations. In many of these drilling units, we are targeting additional pay intervals within the Lower Eagle Ford, as well as adding the Upper Eagle Ford where appropriate. As a result, we are harvesting more of the resource in each drilling unit and the productivity per well continues to deliver steady and predictable results. The Angus pattern identified on slide number 33 of our investor presentation, is an example of the tightly spaced targeted development program that generated improved results with staggered 200-foot spacing. Another important point to remember about EOG's Eagle Ford asset is its proximity to a higher priced market. All of the oil from the Eagle Ford receives LLS prices and typically trades at a premium to WTI. This provides a boost to the already premium results and with more than 2,400 premium locations remaining, the Eagle Ford will continue to be a solid foundation for EOG's success. Now here's David, again, for a quick update on the Austin Chalk in Trinidad. David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Billy. In the South Texas Austin Chalk we continue to drill very prolific and highly economic wells. We've delineated a sweet spot in Karnes County that consistently delivers premium well economics that compete handily with the rest of our portfolio. In the third quarter, we completed eight wells in this sweet spot that delivered a 30 day average IP rate of almost 4,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day each from an average treated lateral of about 6,000 feet. Well costs remain low, averaging under $4.5 million. The most impressive well during the quarter was the Elbrus Unit 103H whose 30-day IP exceeded 7,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day on a lateral length of only 3,700 feet. Incredibly, this well paid out in less than a month. Our exploration work in the South Texas Austin Chalk is focused on identifying additional sweet spots across our acreage. The play is geologically and stratigraphically complex and we expect our ongoing exploration efforts will take time. In Trinidad, we've stepped up activity and continue to drill really good wells in the prolific shallow water reservoirs offshore Trinidad. We completed two wells during the third quarter in the Banyan and Osprey areas, each with initial production rates in excess of 30 million cubic feet a day of natural gas. We expect to complete another three wells before the year is out and estimate that some of these wells have the potential to produce 100 billion cubic feet of gas over their economic life. This will allow us to maintain production in the years ahead and generate strong rates of return from this cash generating asset. I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure. Timothy K. Driggers - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, David. We are maintaining our full year 2017 capital expenditure guidance of $3.7 to $4.1 billion. As Gary mentioned, we are more likely to be at the high end of the range in order to hold on to equipment and services as we prepare for 2018. Total exploration and development expenditures for the third quarter were $1.1 billion including facilities of $147 million and excluding acquisitions, non-cash property exchanges and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $50 million. Capitalized interest for the third quarter was $7 million. During September, we repaid our $600 million 5.875% senior notes. At quarter-end, total debt outstanding was $6.4 billion for a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of 31%. Considering $846 million of cash on-hand at September 30, net debt to total cap was 28%. In the third quarter of 2017, total impairments were $54 million. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 31% and the deferred tax ratio was 175%. Now I'll turn it back over to Bill. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Tim. In closing, I will leave you with a few important points. Over the last few months, the investment communities' emphasis on capital discipline has certainly grown. I'll repeat what I said at the end of 2014 when the downturn began and what we have repeated virtually every quarter since. We are committed to returns, living within our means and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We believe production growth should be the result of investing in high-return drilling and have never been fans of outspending cash flow to pursue growth for growth's sake. Second, we have become a permanently premium company. Our track record of adding premium-level inventory over the last two years is evident that our premium strategy is sustainable. Our premium resource potential now totals more than 7.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent in 8,000 locations. That's more than double the resource potential and more than double the locations from the start of 2016 when we introduced the premium strategy. Furthermore, we are still exploring, still improving existing plays, and we don't see any end to the opportunities to expand our portfolio further. Third, the benefits of a diverse portfolio drive a real competitive advantage for EOG, a strong, stable growth profile that generates high returns and maximizes the value of each asset. It's difficult to sustain both high growth and high returns without the flexibility that multiple premium assets provide. With diverse assets, the result is a focused, disciplined, high-return road to growth. And, finally, EOG is like the Houston Astros. We never give up. We are never satisfied. We never quit getting better. Quarter-by-quarter, we are adding low-cost premium wells to drive down our cost and deliver strong growth. Going forward, our return focus and sweet spot portfolio of assets, supported by a bottoms up, flat, decentralized organization will drive differentiated ROCE performance in the E&P space. Our number one goal is getting ROCE back to our historical average of 13%, or better. We believe this is the best way to create sustainable long-term shareholder value. Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A. Operator : We'll take our first question from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Good morning, Evan. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Congratulations on the organic premium location additions. On the Woodford, what drove the timing of the reveal? I mean, is it that you believe you've acquired all you could? And you mentioned it as a sweet spot, yet how prolific or extensive do you see the Woodford with premium characteristics in the SCOOP? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah. Evan, first of all, the Woodford play, we've got a lot of confidence in it. We drilled three wells, but we have a lot of data. And it's a pretty simple play with the modeling we've done and the analysis we've done and the history we have in shale plays. So I'm going to ask David to kind of expound on this and give you some, a little bit more color on the detail. David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yes, Evan. Yes. Like Bill mentioned, the difference with the Woodford and some of the other plays is that the Woodford is a shale play. So it's fairly simple from a geological standpoint. And we started work in this area back in 2012, 2013 and had a pretty good idea that it could be premium and so we began collecting data. So we've got nearly 400 full petrophysical models built in and around our acreage that's tied to core data. And then what we've been able to do over the years drilling all of these horizontal oil plays is we've been able to collect the data and we've gotten very good at building some sophisticated reservoir models. And so what we did on this particular play is we modeled it ahead of time. We took industry data. We took all the petrophysical models and compared it against, in this case, particularly the Eagle Ford. And compared the completions, versus the reservoir response. And so going into it, we felt very confident that we could make premium wells here in the Woodford. And so we were able to confirm that with the well results that we've had. And so we feel confident about the premium status of this. And then just the timing of it, it's pretty tightly held acreage in this part of the world so we felt comfortable going ahead and releasing the results on it. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Let me just follow up to your responses. I mean, is 50,000 acres sufficient to scale and develop? David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I think just like we talked about in our prepared remarks, our focus is on identifying sweet spots and drilling sweet spots, but be that the Austin Chalk or the Woodford, we want to drill premium wells that are going to continue to lower our finding cost over time and increase our ROCE. So for us, I mean this is a \u2013 as a decentralized company it works really well. This is an instance, like Bill had said, where we can allocate capital to a different play and develop it at the appropriate speed. And so, yeah, we think it's sufficient scale. Operator : We'll go next to Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Good morning, Paul. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Bill, it's very impressive from a growth standpoint. I was wondering when will we get a bigger dividend? When are you going start growing the direct cash return to shareholders? Thanks. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Paul, the dividend is a very strong priority for EOG. We've increased the dividend 16 times in the last 17 years. And consistent with our commitment, our board continues to evaluate the business environment every quarter with the goal of returning cash to shareholders through the dividend and increasing that when appropriate. So that's very high on our list and we are evaluating it. And hopeful as the business environment proves to be stable and improving that we will continue to work on that. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. If I could just observe, it has to really be at least above the S&P 500 yield to be worth paying. I'm looking here at $100 million a quarter. It doesn't seem too onerous to at least double it. Bill, the other thing I'd like to ask you about is the scale of the company. How big, with all of the success that you're having geologically and operationally, how big \u2013 is there an optimal size at which you're going to have to perhaps think harder about disposals and taking stuff off the table as opposed to just adding and adding? Thanks. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: I'll ask Billy Helms to talk about our divestitures. Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah. Paul, this is Billy Helms. I think, it's fair to keep in mind that all these plays we're adding are certainly premium quality, so they're adding to the high end of our portfolio, which we think adds to the net present value of the company. At the same time, we always managed the bottom end of our portfolio. If you look back over the last several years, we've sold over $6 billion of assets. And so that's not to be overlooked. It's a big part of managing our overall asset base and it's part of our long-term strategy to continue to do so. And every year fluctuates, depending on where that property is in the life cycle of its development and play. So it's something we constantly look at and evaluate and actually do each year. Operator : We'll go next to Bob Morris with Citi. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. You just addressed my question on effectively high grading the inventory with continuing to add to these premium locations which, congratulations by the way, on that. As you look at your opportunity for continuing to do that, I notice you continue to spend about $150 million a quarter on exploration. And with a lot of companies focusing on capital discipline and sort of turning to manufacturing mode, has that created more opportunity for you to identify further premium locations as others focus more on manufacturing and do you have the flexibility to look for new plays or repeatable type things like the Woodford that you announced this morning? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yes, Bob. That is our focus, and that's the reason that we continue to have a very robust exploration effort. We don't need more locations. We just are looking for better locations and to be additive to the quality of our already high-quality inventory. So the two plays we talked about today, the First Bone Spring and the Woodford, already will fall in the upper part of our premium inventory. So they'll get more focus than some of the other even premium inventory we have in the company. So we believe \u2013 as we said, we've said many times before, the geology makes a huge amount of difference in the productivity of the wells. And we've had a two decade learning curve on horizontal technology and rock quality, and so we're going to continue to use that to increase the productivity of our wells and the plays that we're looking for. So we want to get better. We're never satisfied. And we see a lot of opportunity out there to continue to increase the quality of the plays we're in. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's great. My second question is you're one of the very few, if maybe only, companies that didn't add to hedges in the quarter and you're still very minimally hedged in 2018. What does that say, or how does that speak to your view on the commodity price and managing that? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yes. Our view on the macro is we're, I think, certainly encouraged by the improving market conditions as we look forward. The market, obviously, is continuing to rebalance nicely. Inventories are moving towards the five-year average, and we are watching the market closely for opportunities. Now I'm going ask Lance to comment a little bit more on that. D. Lance Terveen - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah. Bob, good morning. Really, as we think about it, we're going to stay poised. As Bill mentioned, inventories continue to draw globally, but also in the U.S. And then you look at the market, it's in backwardation, too, for WTI and Brent, so. Also, in our view, we think U.S. production hasn't been growing quite as prolific as what others have originally estimated. So as we look at those dynamics in the market, we're going to really stay poised here. And we've been disciplined since 2015, and we've been waiting for this turn. So we're going to continue to watch here going into 2018. Operator : We'll go next to Leo Mariani with NatAlliance Securities. Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities : Yeah. Hey, guys. Just quick question on the First Bone Spring here. Obviously, the Bone Spring has been a target for a number of years out there in the Permian Basin. You guys have been active drilling wells here for a little while. Was there some dramatic change that happened recently that caused you guys to kind of move this up into a premium position? Maybe you could just discuss that a little bit. Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, Leo, is this Billy Helms. For the First Bone Spring, it's just yet another pay zone that we've been \u2013 certainly have been identified and we've been testing over the last several years. And most of our activity in the past year or two has been focused on, certainly, the Wolfcamp, which is highly prolific and we've got multiple zones there. We've also previously announced the Second Bone Spring's resource estimate. So this is just the next step. The First Bone Spring is certainly a highly prolific and very competitive zone with those targets and we've now delineated the program with about 15 wells over a fairly extensive area and had confidence enough to come out and delineate the resource potential on our acreage there. So it was really just the next step in the evolution of the Delaware Basin. Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities : Okay. That's helpful. I just wanted to kind of follow-up a little bit on some of the 30-day oil production rate data you guys provided in the third quarter. Just in the various different Delaware plays, Eagle Ford and DJ, just noticing that your 30-day oil rates, while still strong, were down a little bit from second quarter averages. Just wanted to see if there was anything in particular sort of driving that. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: No, there's nothing out of the ordinary there. They vary from quarter-to-quarter based on lateral lengths and where we're drilling in each part of the play. There's no, really, distinct trend you can draw from it. It's kind of up and down a little bit every quarter. We are doing appropriate spacing tests, especially as we're pretty new in the Delaware Basin. And so that may affect volumes a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. And then the parts of the play vary quite a bit. So there's nothing unusual there. I wouldn't try to read anything in any of that that would be out of the ordinary. Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Bill, I wonder if I could ask a slightly different question about the premium inventory. The Woodford, as it's disclosed, I mean, obviously great news, but it's 3% of your locations. The Bakken is now about 4% of your locations. And I guess my point is that is there a point on the line where you start to think about monetizing some of these high-quality smaller portfolio positions, given how long dated your premium location inventory now there's a cost of these (41:56). I'm wondering if there's another optimization decision to be had here as you bring these smaller assets into the portfolio? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Doug, the Woodford and the Bakken, you mentioned specifically, those would not be ones that we would think about monetizing at this point because, obviously the Woodford has got tremendous upside to it and is on the high end of our quality of the premium inventory, and we also believe the Bakken has too. It's still got a lot of upside. We have, as I said in the opening, that we captured the sweet spot there, and continue to think that there is quite a bit of additional premium drilling to go on both of those. And so we like having multiple high-quality assets because it allows the company to increase capital or disburse capital with discipline. And it allows us to put to work capital with a lot of confidence that we can continue to have very, very strong returns and execute each one of those plays at the proper speed to maximize the NPV and the finding costs. And that is what really will drive the ROC improvements in company going forward. And in each one of our plays, we have a slide in the slide deck, I believe it's slide 16 that shows you that the returns that we have in each one of our plays, if we drill premium wells, is very, very strong. And they're all fairly equal. And so that's the advantage of having multiple plays and having a decentralized organization that can focus, reduce the cost and improve the quality of wells at the same time and maximize the value of each one of them. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I know it's a bit of a stretch, but I think I wanted to just take your opinion on the portfolio high-grading. So my follow up, Bill, it seems the 15% to 25% at $50 to $60 with the well results you've had, it strikes us you can probably do that same range of growth at a lower oil deck. So I guess my question is as we see oil starting to get a little bit healthier at least in the out years, how would you think about incremental allocation of capital? Would it be the 15% to 25% is sacrosanct and anything beyond that goes back to shareholders or just how are you thinking about the upside case for production growth? And I'll leave it there. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: If prices rise, obviously, our discretionary cash flow is very, very strong. It's increasing even if prices don't rise. So the first thing is, when we decide to reinvest additional cash we're going to do it with discipline. We're not going to sacrifice returns to grow faster. We only incrementally invest if our returns are equal or better. And, again, that is I think an advantage of multiple plays in a decentralized system that we have in place to execute that. What I'd say the highest priority in the company is really to continue to reinvest in the premium inventory because we believe that's the best way to increase shareholder value. But we also want to continue to firm up the balance sheet and we want to work on that and getting our net debt down lower than what it is now. So that will be a priority. And then the third thing, as I talked about already, is we have a very, very strong commitment to the dividend, so we want to continue to increase cash to the shareholders through the dividend going forward. Operator : We'll go next to Scott Hanold with RBC. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Good morning. Could I ask a little bit more on the Woodford? You drew a box on your presentation of where you, I'll see that as perspective and marked it above 50,000 acres. Can you talk about the working interest you have in there? And do you expect \u2013 where do you expect that to go over time? David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Scott, this is David. Yeah. So far the wells we've drilled there in the Woodford, they've been very high working interest, probably close to 100%. I would think going forward right now, we're probably on average, it's going to vary quite a bit across the play, but, probably on average it's probably around 50%. So we've got work to do there as far as (47:11) and things like that. So right now I'd say it's probably around 50%. But the numbers we've given you as far as resource estimate, that's all net numbers, the 260 net locations and acreage position there. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Right. So on a gross location you've got a good 500 plus it sounds like. And so when you talk about ramping that opportunity up in 2018, what kind of pace are you generally thinking about now? David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I think we're going to wait to give any kind of specific guidance until the next call on our plan, but we would say that we do intend to ramp that up next year. Operator : We'll go next to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Good morning, Bill, to you and your team there. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Good morning, Charles. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: And congratulations to your teams for maturing those two new premium plays. I'd like to go back to an earlier question. I believe it was from Bob Morris, was asking about your macro outlook given that you're unhedged. But there was another comment you made in your prepared remarks that you're going to be near the high end of your CapEx guidance to secure the services you guys need going into 2018. And to me putting those two together really looks like the management team is pretty bullish on the commodity and activity levels. And I'm wondering if that's a fair read, not just on the commodity but on the activity levels. And if it is, if you have any concerns or any lookouts for pinch points on service availability in 2018. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Charles, just first off on our, I think, our confidence in the macro and the oil price. We do feel like the market is in an improving situation. There's no doubt about that. But even if oil prices stay at $50, no better than they are this year, our discretionary cash flow is growing substantially. So I'm going to ask Gary Thomas to kind of comment on the services and the availability of equipment and maybe the pricing there. Gary L. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yes, Charles. As was brought up this morning, all of our decisions is really based on increasing our rate of return. And you mentioned pinch point, and pinch point would probably be in just thinking about the various services that are available. There's been little equipment added over the last couple of years. And that's one of the main reasons that we've increased our activity here with the additional 25 wells; it's just to ensure that we have top-tier services available to continue to reduce our cost and just develop and produce more of the low-cost oil, which is going to increase our return on capital investment. But our divisions have just done an outstanding job assembling our best-performing drilling rigs, completion services, all those services, probably the best ever. And we just want to be careful not to lose those, because our intent is just to continue to reduce our cost over time. Charles, I'd also like to add that we always built in the flexibility to respond to whatever oil price presents itself next year. So we're always thinking about that and built that into our thinking on what equipment and how much of it if we put a long-term contract versus short term and how we manage our business. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Thank you, Bill and Gary. That's helpful color. And then, if I could have one other question, my follow-up question on the Delaware Basin, perhaps this would be best for Billy Helms. Billy, you guys had the emergence of this First Bone Springs this quarter, but as I look at maps or the charts you guys have in your investor book, the Wolfcamp section is about as thick as that whole Bone Springs section put together, and you're just identifying one target there right now. So could you talk about what are the prospects over the next coming quarters for you guys to mature another horizon within the Wolfcamp? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, Charles. I'd say, yeah, our focus there has been mainly on identifying the best target intervals within the Wolfcamp, so we've tested a number of different perspective pay targets. And then, really, what we're trying to better understand is \u2013 and as we move into development mode, how is the best way to develop the asset, and so we're testing a lot of different \u2013 along with testing different target intervals, we're testing a lot of spacing patterns. What's the right spacing pattern within each well, between wells, between target intervals, and those kind of things. So, as you know, as you get into these large horizontal programs, you have to be able to manage the parent-child interference, the offset depletion appropriately to maximize the recovery and the economics of every play. Just a reminder, we've got over a decade of doing that kind of thing in various plays. So we're utilizing all that knowledge that we've gained in all these different plays to better understand how to do that. So I'd tell you it's a little bit early to think about what we would roll out next, but I'd say that there's certainly upside we see in the basin for continued growth, and we're very excited about what we see for the potential of the Delaware Basin. Operator : We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good. Thanks. Maybe a question on allocation to capital. I mean, how should we think about the relative prioritization to capital within the portfolio amongst the assets as we look into 2018? I know you're working on the budget right now, but should we expect a similar mix of Eagle Ford versus Permian versus other as we saw in 2017? Or is there going to be additional relative shift towards some other? Then, in particular, how should we think about allocation to capital for the two new assets? So maybe start there. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Ryan, yeah. The capital allocation, certainly, the Permian would be a high priority. Obviously, the Eagle Ford continues to get a lot of capital. And then the plays in the Rockies, and certainly the new Woodford play, as David talked about, will get quite a bit more capital than it had obviously this year. We'll get into a development mode on that. And I think it's the advantage again that we have in the company is that we can disburse capital very easily and have a lot of confidence that we're generating really high returns. And because of our decentralized structure, and all the plays are very, very high quality. So it's pretty easy for us to disburse capital out and have a lot of confidence in it. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And within that framework, I guess, in the past at some point, you had talked about in that kind of $50 to $55 world that the Permian would be the largest growth driver, the Eagle Ford would be probably more of a mid to high-single digit trajectory. Is that kind of the right way to think about the Eagle Ford within this current framework? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Ryan, yes. That's a good way of thinking about it. The Permian, the Delaware is our primary driver of growth and the Eagle Ford is in the secondary position on that right now. But all of them are getting fantastic returns. And that's the way we want to do it. We're really focused on returns first. And that's the top priority of the company and to maximize the ROCE. Operator : We'll go next to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning. Bill, I was wondering if you could give us some commentary on how you're thinking about 2018. On slide 19, you've given us, kind of, your 15% to 25% long-term growth CAGR. The Street for 2018 is at 18% growth. I was just wondering if you could just give us how you're thinking about your planning for next year? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Arun, we're not going to give out a specific number at this point. So, everybody, you'll just have to wait until our February call on that. Certainly, our long-term outlook that we've given, 15% to 25%, is still valid. But we'll work through the plan and then we'll let everybody know the specifics in February. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Can we read into anything, the fact that you've added a couple of rigs and have added frac crews as any indication about next year? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: No. You shouldn't read really anything in that. We wanted to secure those because they're very, very high quality, that that kind of equipment is hard to get if you're trying to add something new. And so we didn't want to let it go. And then we captured it at very low cost, too, so we wanted to lock that in. But I wouldn't read anything really, into anything. We're still working through our plan and we'll let you know that in February. Operator : We'll go next to Dave Kistler with Simmons Piper Jaffray. David Kistler - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Good morning, guys. Speaking a little bit about the decentralized structure and a lot of questions regarding capital allocation, can you talk a little bit about, even though it's decentralized, how flexible you can be to redirect capital or activity to basically optimize returns in not just an annual basis, but in a shorter term basis? So, for example, LLS prices are great right now. Service environment in Eagle Ford isn't quite as pressured as other areas. How quickly can you redirect capital or do you think about doing that in a decentralized environment? Gary L. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Dave, this is Gary Thomas. Really the decentralized nature of EOG helps us to turn on a dime. We've got all of these different plays working. We can ramp up, ramp down. The way we've structured our contracts with our vendors, we can move equipment from one to the other. And as far as \u2013 and Bill brought this up, is us being able to share what the breakthroughs are, the efficiencies. We often get together with our technical groups. We have those conferences that are going be starting up here right after the first of the year. So there's a tremendous amount of sharing among divisions to ensure that these different divisions that are working different plays, finding new and better ways to improve our efficiencies are just continually shared. So we like to think of it as having various think tanks and it works really well for us. David Kistler - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Well, I appreciate that tremendously. And then, one last maybe macro question, in the past, you guys have talked about scarcity of premium resources across kind of the total U.S. and that you obviously feel advantaged, and rightfully so, with what you've been able to put together. But that has enhanced your macro outlook. As you guys continue to grow premium resources organically within your current acreage base, but also as an example with the Woodford outside of it, does that change your thoughts in terms of total resource content in the U.S. or total premium inventory and what that might mean to macro supply on a longer term basis? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Dave, no, it really doesn't. We think the highest quality sweet spot parts of the crude oil plays are relatively small compared to the total. And when you look across the U.S. horizontal oil plays, there is a very large percent of wells that, we believe, are not economic, certainly at $50 oil, and need a much higher oil price to be economic. So these premium plays, the sweet spots are really the economic parts of these horizontal oil plays, and those are the ones we're focused on, obviously, only. We're not really interested in most of the acreage. So we believe if oil stayed at $50, the economic limits of the industry, U.S. horizontal oil, are somewhat limited by that. Operator : At this time, this does conclude the question-and-answer portion of today's call. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Thomas for any final remarks. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: In closing, EOG's third quarter results were remarkable in many ways. As reported today, the company is focused on delivering strong returns by reducing costs, completing great wells and increasing the size and quality of our drilling inventory. We have a sustainable business model and we're excited about EOG's ability to create long-term shareholder value. In addition, I would like to say thank you to the EOG family for the tremendous contribution of time and money to Hurricane Harvey relief. Our combined efforts raised over $2.8 million. Thank you for listening, and thank you for your support. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc. Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the EOG Resources Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir. Timothy K. Driggers - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thank you, and good morning. Thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risk associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable reserves, as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves, not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website. Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Gary Thomas, President; Billy Helms, Chief Operating Officer; David Trice, EVP-Exploration & Production; Ezra Yacob, EVP-Exploration & Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP-Marketing; David Streit, VP-Investor & Public Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening and we included guidance for the first quarter and full year 2018 in yesterday's press release. This morning we'll discuss topics in the following order. Bill Thomas will review 2017 highlights; Billy Helms, Ezra Yacob, and David Trice will preview our 2018 capital plan, review operational results, and year-end reserve replacement data. Then I will discuss the new tax law, EOG's financials and capital structure; and Bill will provide concluding remarks. Here's Bill Thomas. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Tim. EOG is driven by returns. Our goal is to earn return on capital employed that is not only the best among our peers in the E&P industry, but also competitive with the best companies outside our industry. Premium returns and capital discipline are how we reach that goal. Furthermore, by executing our premium capital allocation standard and practicing capital discipline, we believe we can sustain competitive ROCE throughout the commodity price cycle. Earning sustainable ROCE is how we deliver long-term shareholder value. First, I'd like to discuss our premium capital allocation standard. As a reminder, for a well to be classified as premium requires a 30% direct after-tax rate of return and a flat $40 oil price. Premium wells have low finding and development cost per Boe and the premium reserves we've been adding are beginning to make a significant difference in our bottom line results. In addition, the full benefit of our current inventory of premium location has not been fully realized. As we continue to drill premium wells and add low costs reserves, our DD&A rate will continue to fall. We also believe we will continue to reduce completed well costs and operating costs in 2018, which Billy Helms will update you on shortly. As a result, we are in a position to generate healthy financial returns even in a moderate oil price environment. When you couple this with increasing oil prices, like those we are seeing today, the potential for generating higher ROCE accelerates. Second, EOG's capital discipline governs our growth. Disciplined growth means not adding overpriced or poor performing services and equipment in order to grow. Disciplined growth means not growing so fast that we outrun the technical learning curve and leave significant reserve value in the ground. Disciplined growth means operating at a pace that allows EOG to sustainably lower costs and improve well productivity, instead of growing so fast that costs go up and well productivity goes down. EOG's disciplined growth is driven and incentivized by returns and not growth for growth's sake. Our strong growth is an expression of generating strong returns first. And finally, EOG's disciplined growth maintains a strong balance sheet. We will not issue new equity or debt to fund capital expenditures or the dividend. In 2017, we grew high return U.S. oil production 20%, paid the dividend, reduced our debt, and generated over $200 million in free cash flow. Remarkably, we delivered those results, while oil prices averaged a modest $50. Throughout the downturn, our goal was to reset the company to be successful in a lower oil price environment. We shifted to premium drilling in 2016 and the power of our premium drilling is now evident in our 2017 bottom line results. We believe this sets EOG apart as one of the most capital efficient and disciplined growth companies in the U.S. Here are more highlights from 2017. Our premium well level returns are reflected in our bottom line results. We significantly improved net income, cash flow, and ROCE. Our commitment to exploration-driven organic growth drove increases to premium net resource potential of 2.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent from an additional 2,000 net premium drilling locations, which is nearly 4 times the number of wells completed in 2017. We increased proved reserves 18%, replacing more than 200% of last year's production at low finding and development cost, which lowered our company DD&A rate by 12%. Due to sustainable cost initiatives, we continued to lower total well costs and operating costs. And additionally, as a result of the board's confidence in EOG's future performance and exploration prospects, we approved a 10% dividend increase. 2017 was just the start of realizing the full benefit of premium drilling. In 2018, we'll improve in every category we use to measure performance internally. Capital efficiency is up. All-in rate of return and PVI are better, and all-in finding costs are lower this year than last year. In 2018, we expect to earn double-digit ROCE, deliver strong disciplined organic production growth, and substantial free cash flow. EOG is a high return organic growth company. We have expanded our industry lead in both returns and growth, and we are excited about the future. Up next to provide details on our operational performance in 2017 and preview the 2018 game plan is Billy Helms. Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Bill. The progress we've made on our capital cost structure, operational cost structure, and overall capital efficiency these last three years during the downturn has been phenomenal. EOG has never been more efficient in its history. Surviving a downturn is always challenging, but it also creates many opportunities for improvement. Like many in the industry, we realize the benefits of lower service cost. But the bigger opportunity was to lower our cost structure through operational efficiencies. It never fails when EOG enters a downturn, we resurface on the other side as a more efficient, leaner and better company. It's the one reason to get excited about a down cycle. We slow down and take a critical look at how we can improve every aspect of our business. In 2018, we expect to deliver 18% oil growth, 16% total equivalent growth, with a $5.6 billion capital program. Our 2018 capital plan includes tests of several new plays and an expansion of our more recently announced emerging plays. We've increased activity in each area at a deliberate pace designed to maintain our capital efficiency achieved in recent years. We will not increase activity if it means eroding our operational performance or increasing our well cost. In 2017, we set our sights on drilling longer laterals and larger well packages. Determining the most efficient number of wells to drill and complete together is essential to maximizing the recovery and net present value of the whole asset. Those efforts will expand in 2018. Our average lateral will be 8% longer this year, and we expect the average size of our well packages to more than double. Larger well packages and increased use of multi-well pads increase the inventory of wells needed to stay ahead of our completion crews. Therefore, activity and inventory will build, particularly in the first quarter, and there will be fewer wells brought online in the first half of the year compared to the second half. More specifically, only 27 net wells were brought online in January, so first quarter volumes were down sequentially. However, the pace of volume growth will be fairly balanced for the remaining three quarters. During 2017, we opportunistically contracted with the most efficient service providers and secured a large portion of our 2018 services during favorable market conditions. This was a rate of return decision to lock in low cost as we move into a year where we expect to see increased industry activity and potential price inflation. We secured 85% of our drilling rigs at very favorable rates compared to the current market, and under these agreements, we maintain flexibility with our favored vendors to adjust, should market conditions dictate. We've locked in 80% of our casing needs with prices 15% to 20% below the current market. We also locked in 60% of our frac fleets below current market prices, and we have more diverse and local sources of frac sand, and sand unit costs are expected to decrease by 15% year-over-year. Beyond contracted service costs, we're confident we can further improve operational efficiencies in a number of areas. During the downturn, we took the opportunity to upgrade our rig fleet to one of the most modern and efficient in the industry. On the completion side, we expect to complete 5% to 10% more wells per frac fleet this year, despite longer laterals. We also continue to expand our water infrastructure and reuse program, which is expected to reduce well cost in some areas by another $100,000 per well. Through these and other efforts, we are building on our momentum from last year when we reduced well costs 7% across active areas. This year, we expect to reduce completed well costs an additional 5% across the board. This is unique in the industry, as I expect that we are one of the few companies that will have decreased well cost in both 2017 and 2018. We also expect to see downward pressure on our unit operating cost, reducing LOE, transportation, and DD&A driven by infrastructure, information technology, and a relentless focus on operating efficiency. 2018 will be another great year for improvements to EOG's capital efficiency, maintaining our position as the low-cost, high-return leader in the E&P industry. I'll now turn the call over to Ezra, who will update you on the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin plays. Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Billy. The Eagle Ford continues to be the workhorse and centerpiece of EOG's oil production portfolio of assets. Consistent well performance combined with sustained low well costs and operational costs contributed to the Eagle Ford achieving the best overall returns in the company in 2017. Well costs in the Eagle Ford continue to decrease, averaging just $4.5 million per 5,300-foot lateral. Lower cost wells, longer laterals, and precision targeting are driving increased well productivity and led to the addition of 500 net premium locations, more than two times the number completed in 2017. We expect to make additional operational improvements in 2018 and plan to complete 260 net wells, targeting record well costs of $4.3 million per well. We continue to increase the size of our well packages and extend lateral lengths while being careful to maintain per-foot recovery. The goal of these measured improvements is to maximize the NPV per section of this consistently prolific asset. Our 582,000 net acre position is now 99% held by production. Exploration work will continue in 2018 to delineate areas that can support multiple targets in the Lower Eagle Ford and delineate where the Upper Eagle Ford can produce premium rates of return. The Eagle Ford continues to be a growth asset for the company that we expect will contribute premium return production and reserve additions. On our Eagle Ford acreage, we also drilled some of the most prolific and high-return wells in our history in the Austin Chalk. The average 30-day production from the 28 net wells completed in 2017 was well over 3,200 barrels of oil equivalents per day. Furthermore, well costs averaged $4.9 million for laterals ranging from 4,000 to 6,000 feet. We expect to complete another 25 net wells in 2018. Last year, we identified a sweet spot in Karnes County through an integrated exploration effort. Precision targets within the Austin Chalk respond extremely well to EOG's high density completions. We continue to combine our geologic database created through our Eagle Ford development with recent core data from the Austin Chalk to delineate additional sweet spots across our Eagle Ford acreage. The Austin Chalk is geologically and stratigraphically complex, so our continued exploration effort will take time. The Delaware Basin is setting up to be our fastest growing asset for a second year in a row after almost doubling crude oil production last year. We made tremendous progress during 2017. We continued mapping the geologic complexities of this mile-thick column of pay. We tested multiple spacing patterns to determine how best to develop stacked pay that maximizes recovery and NPV per section, and we delivered record-breaking well results and phenomenal returns for the company. Furthermore, we added 700 net premium locations within our existing targets, the Wolfcamp, Second Bone Spring and Leonard, through well productivity gains and cost reductions. We introduced a fourth premium target, the First Bone Spring, adding 540 net premium locations for a combined total of more than 1,200 net locations, a 35% increase year over year. We lowered completed well costs in the Wolfcamp 9%. We increased lateral lengths about 20%, lowering cost per foot and, more importantly, without losing per foot reserves. In 2017, we drilled and completed 24 net wells associated with our merger and acquisition with Yates Petroleum at the end of 2016. As previously highlighted, much of this acreage was hand in glove fit with EOG's legacy acreage position, and this resulted in the opportunity to drill extended laterals and the ability to utilize much of our existing infrastructure in our core area. The wells tested multiple targets, and approximately 50% of the wells were drilled outside of our core acreage position. The results exceeded our initial expectations. Overall, this 24-well program delivered a 97% direct after-tax rate of return. Most of our drilling in the Delaware Basin targeted the Upper Wolfcamp, which will continue to be the case in 2018. The Wolfcamp earns some of the best rates of return in the company and has the added benefit of giving us a look at shallower Bone Spring and Leonard targets. We also expect to lower Wolfcamp costs, and we'll continue to increase operational efficiency through longer laterals and larger packages of wells. In 2018, we plan to complete 205 net wells in the Wolfcamp, 10 in the First and Second Bone Spring and 15 in the Leonard. Our drilling program in the Delaware Basin totals 230 net wells. While we brought online an average of two wells per package last year, we expect to average about five wells per package in 2018. We'll also continue to test both well spacing and well timing to maximize recovery and NPV. Lastly, our team has done an exceptional job positioning our Delaware Basin asset for key takeaway capacity away from the Permian Basin at low cost. Our existing gas and water gathering systems controlled by EOG drive low LOE and transportation costs. Also, a new oil gathering system and terminal will begin service for EOG this quarter. From the new terminal, EOG will ultimately have up to four market connections to downstream markets, where we secured firm capacity to Cushing and Corpus. Furthermore, our team has been very active on the residue gas front. We've secured significant transportation away from the Permian Basin and Waha Hub. We started this process in 2015 and have tactically layered in firm capacity over time to match up with our drilling program. This capacity provides diversified marketing options and potential pricing advantages over those waiting on new built pipelines. This asset is one of, if not the best, tight oil play in North America, and we are excited about its tremendous growth potential. Here's David Trice to review the progress we've made in the Mid-Continent and our Rockies, Bakken, and international activity. David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Ezra. Last quarter we introduced a new premium oil play in the Eastern Anadarko Basin, the Woodford oil window. This play is a concentrated sweet spot of moderately over-pressured high quality rock located primarily in McClain County, Oklahoma. The well we highlighted when introducing the Woodford, the Curry 21, is a fascinating well that continues to demonstrate a very low decline rate, particularly considering that it is a shale reservoir. The average 150-day rate for the Curry is over 1,100 barrels of oil per day, which is a low decline compared to its initial 30-day rate of about 1,500 barrels of oil per day. The Curry well is solidly in the oil window as opposed to many SCOOP/STACK wells that are in the gas condensate window. It produces a 43 degree API oil with a gas/oil ratio of approximately 1,000. This premium well is earning over 100% direct after-tax rate of return at today's strip. Currently we have one rig working in the Woodford oil window and plan to add another rig later this quarter. We expect to complete 25 net wells in 2018 and have planned a number of spacing tests. Our current inventory of 260 net locations assumes an average of 660 feet between wells. We expect to test spacing down to 330 feet. The addition of the Woodford play demonstrates EOG's ability to consistently add premium quality rock and inventory. Plays like the Woodford enhance the diversity of our portfolio and provide the flexibility to consistently grow production, while maintaining capital efficiency for years to come. The Powder River Basin has become a core asset for EOG. We amassed 400,000 net acres following the merger with Yates in late 2016, and we are consistently drilling low-cost, moderate-decline wells that compete with the best in the company. Last year we stepped up activity, completing 39 net wells, 9 more than our initial plan. Completed well costs for an 8,000-foot lateral dropped 10%, helping drive returns in the Powder River Basin that are highly competitive with returns from our largest premium asset, the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin. In 2018, we expect to complete 45 net wells, targeting well costs of $4.5 million. Our focus will be blocking up acreage, testing spacing, and mapping the Powder River Basin's mile-deep column of pay to delineate acreage that is prospective for various targets. We continue to see significant premium inventory potential in the Powder River Basin. We're also stepping up activity in the Wyoming DJ Basin, doubling our activity to 35 net wells in 2018. DJ Basin well results are less flashy than our other basins; however, they produce consistent low-decline results and are the fastest to drill and the lower cost wells in the company. We routinely drill 18,000-foot wells in three to four days, while remaining in a tight target window. We averaged $4.5 million for 9,000-foot laterals in 2017, and this year we expect to average just $4 million. Additionally, robust water and gas gathering infrastructure is driving down operating cost. In the Bakken, last year's activity was focused on drawing down our inventory of legacy drilled but uncompleted wells, which didn't have the benefit of our latest precision targeting techniques. Once we completed our inventory of DUCs, we completed a few fantastic wells in both the Bakken and the Three Forks targets. In 2017, the top well of a package of four new wells of the Antelope Extension produced almost 3,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first 30 days. After 120 days, production was holding up averaging over 2,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Now that our pre-2016 DUC inventory is depleted, we are excited to get a fresh start for our 2018 drilling program and take advantage of the significant progress made on our Bakken cost structure. In the past two years, we've cut completed well cost by more than a third to $4.6 million for a long 8,400-foot lateral. Furthermore, we expect to continue lowering costs through a recently implemented seasonal drilling and completion program. Wells are drilled year-round, then completed mostly during the summer. This program will eliminate the additional expense incurred by handling water during the freezing winter months and dealing with road restrictions during breakup. This is a great example of how EOG can continue to increase capital efficiency. Our deep premium inventory in multiple basins provides flexibility to adjust to changing operational conditions in any given basin. In 2018, we'll focus our 20 net well program in the Bakken Core and Antelope Extension. We'll also drill a number of step-out wells in the Bakken Lite and other areas to continue testing and refining our latest precision targeting and advanced completions outside our core operating areas. Our lower cost structure in the Bakken generates highly competitive premium returns and we are optimistic it will drive additional sources of premium inventory over time. We had an eventful year in Trinidad division during 2017. We brought on seven net natural gas wells across our Sercan, Banyan, and Osprey areas. The outperformance of these new wells allowed our Trinidad division to produce 15 million cubic feet of gas per day, more than initially forecasted in 2017. We also finalized a new gas contract with the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago beginning in 2019, that supports and extends our 25-year partnership. Looking ahead, 2018 is going to be an exploration year in Trinidad. Our exploration efforts are focused on leveraging new seismic data to identify prospects to drill in 2019 and beyond in order to maintain natural gas production and supply the domestic Trinidad gas market for many years to come. Here's Billy to review our year-end reserve replacement and finding costs. Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, David. We replaced more than 200% of our 2017 production at a very low finding cost of $8.71 per Boe, which excludes positive revisions due to commodity price improvements. The proved developed finding cost, excluding leasehold capital and revisions due to price, was $10.73 per Boe. Improving well productivity and sustainable cost reductions drove positive reserve revisions. As a result, our proved reserves increased 380 million barrels of oil equivalent, or 18% year-over-year. Our ability to consistently add reserves at low cost demonstrates the tremendous capital efficiency gains we made through the downturn from our permanent shift to premium drilling and laser focus on cost reductions. I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss the new tax law, financials, and capital structure. Timothy K. Driggers - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Billy. The tax law enacted near the end of 2017 had a number of effects on EOG's results of operations, cash flows, and consolidated financial statements. I will discuss a few of the more significant items. You can find details on these and other items related to the new tax law in Note 6 of EOG's annual report on Form 10-K, which we filed yesterday with the SEC. EOG recorded a noncash reduction in the fourth quarter and full year 2017 income tax provision of $2.2 billion related to the re-measurement of its net deferred tax liability for the lower statutory tax rate under new law. The reduction in income tax expense caused an increase in net income and shareholders' equity by a like amount. In addition, the tax law repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax and allows AMT credit carryovers to be refunded over four years beginning in 2018. EOG estimates that its AMT credits being carried over to 2018 will total $798 million. The tax law provides for a tax on deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017. EOG estimates it has a deemed repatriation tax liability of $179 million which can be paid over eight years. The tax law also makes fundamental changes to the taxation of multinational companies, including a shift to a so-called territorial system. Under this new regime, EOG does not expect to pay any significant amount of U.S. federal income taxes on its foreign operating earnings beginning in 2018. Finally, the tax law preserves the immediate deductibility of intangible drilling costs as well as expands and extends bonus depreciation. All of these amounts are estimates which EOG believes to be reasonable, but could change based on further analysis, new IRS guidance, and other factors. A strong balance sheet is an important part of EOG's strategy. This is appropriate in a capital-intensive cyclical industry. This financial strength enables us to maintain a low-cost structure and strategic relationship with our service providers by funding a steady CapEx program; make commitments for low-cost services and supplies at opportunistic times, often when oil and gas prices are depressed; and similarly, make opportunistic acquisitions of acreage or other assets. We are very pleased that EOG weathered the industry downturn without an equity offering or cutting the dividend. Financial leverage as measured by net debt-to-total-capitalization has declined from 34% at its peak in June 2016 to 25% at year-end 2017. We estimate that with $60 oil in 2018, EOG can generate over $1.5 billion of free cash flow after paying the dividend. We intend to repay with cash on hand $350 million bond that matures in October of this year. In addition, the board increased the dividend by 10% this week, affirming our commitment to the dividend. Beyond that, we intend to further strengthen the balance sheet this year. Now I'll turn it back over to Bill. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Tim. In closing, I will leave you with a few important takeaways. First, the size and quality of our horizontal assets are unmatched in the industry. In 2018, we have active drilling programs across nine high-quality premium plays. EOG has the unique flexibility to allocate capital to maximize returns by adjusting to changing market conditions and managing each asset's development pace with technical and cost reduction discipline. Second, in 2018, we have a robust exploration program underway in multiple basins, with more capital allocated to this process than in recent years. Our long history of horizontal drilling and vast proprietary database combined with an innovative EOG culture are working together to make EOG the leader in organic generation of new and better premium drilling inventory. Third, EOG is a leader in capital discipline with a relentless focus on returns. We are committed to delivering industry-leading high-return organic oil growth, committed to our dividend, and committed to reducing debt, while generating significant free cash flow in 2018. And finally, the power of premium has placed us among the low-cost producers in the global oil market. Our potential for financial returns, operational performance, and overall capital efficiency is much better today than before the downturn. In 2018, we are poised for strong, disciplined growth. More importantly, we are positioned to reach our goal of returning to double-digit ROCE performance, which is competitive not only with our peers in the E&P industry, but also with the broader market. Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. Questions are limited to one question and one follow-up question. We will take as many questions as time permits. We'll pause for just a moment to give everyone an opportunity to signal for questions. And we'll take our first question from Leo Mariani with NatAlliance. Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities : Hey, guys. Just a quick question here on the Eagle Ford. So just noticing that your oil volumes in the Eagle Ford didn't really grow in 2017; I think they were down a little bit versus the prior year. You guys kind of signaled this was a growth asset in your prepared comments. I think you're drilling more wells this year. Is there anything else that's sort of changing there maybe technically other than just kind of drilling more wells this year? And is this expected to kind of be a growth asset for many years to come? Can you just comment on that? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, Leo, this is Billy Helms. Yeah, the San Antonio division, our Eagle Ford division really operates both the Eagle Ford and the Austin Chalk. And if you look at the two combined, well volumes were up slightly for both Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk. The Eagle Ford position, as you mentioned, it is a growth asset for the company and we expect that to grow into 2018. But last year the mix of the wells was balanced between the Eagle Ford and the Austin Chalk, and together they did grow. Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities : Okay. And just following-up on your comments around free cash flow here. So clearly, you guys plan on putting out some pretty significant free cash flow if oil holds $60 here. You talked about the $350 million debt pay-down as well as the 10% dividend hike. But clearly, there's going to be proceeds beyond that. What else is EOG potentially planning on doing with the money? Could there be a ramp-up in even more exploration activity than you've already talked about, or more acreage purchases? Just any color around that please. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Leo, this is Bill Thomas. Yeah, certainly our priorities haven't changed. Our first priority is to use free cash flow and reinvest in the high-return drilling. And we think this is the best way to continue to improve the company, to increase ROCE, and the shareholder value. The one caveat on that is we're not going to ramp-up spending at the cost of returns. We want to maintain the efficiencies and the cost that we built into the system, and in fact, we want to continue to improve. So we want to go at a pace that our well productivity continues to improve. It's improved this year over last year and our rates of return in our 2018 plan are improved this year over last year, and that's because we continue to reduce costs and increase productivity. And so we want to continue to do that and continue to reinvest. That's our first priority. The second is, as Tim mentioned, we want to continue to firm up our balance sheet. Really, our goal is to have an impeccable balance sheet and we're going to pay off the bond this year and as we go forward, we want to incrementally continue to reduce debt and firm up the balance sheet. This gives us so much flexibility. It's served us so well during the last downturn. We didn't have to issue equity or we didn't cut the dividend. We want to be a consistent deliverer of shareholder value throughout the commodity cycles. And it does position us to take advantage of opportunities for maybe an acquisition. We continue to look at those, but also, as you mentioned, we are very organic, prolific, generating company and we have a lot of exploration and step-out testing going on this year. We collect a lot of core data, and our goal with all that is to find better and better inventory than we currently have. We think that is investments into the future of the company and those are very, very important to us getting better. So we want to be able to take advantage of that. And then our third priority is our commitment to the dividend. We have a strong commitment to the dividend. We've increased it 17 times over the last year. As we've said, we increased it this quarter and our board is committed to continuing to increase our shareholder value certainly through better ROCEs in the future, and through our commitment to the dividend. So those are all the priorities we have and we're going to stay focused on that and stay focused on getting better as we go forward. Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities : Thanks, guys. Operator : We'll go next to Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah, thanks. Could you guys give a little bit of color on some of the increased pad sizes you're expecting? And is it primarily mostly in the Permian? What was the pad size you did last year versus what you're looking at this year? And a little bit of color on that in the Eagle Ford as well. Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, Scott, this is Ezra. Yeah, we're increasing the package size of these wells in both the Eagle Ford and Permian. And we're increasing this \u2013 the focus really is on maximizing the NPV of the sections and returns. And so when we plan these packages, we want to plan them large enough that they take advantage of the increased operational efficiency and cost savings that come with that. But at the same time, we don't want to increase them to the size and scale where they take so long that we cannot incorporate learnings from one set of wells to the next. As you know, we like to collect an awful lot of real-time data and incorporate that into the next wells that we drill. And so really it's kind of a balancing act between those two things. As we highlighted, in the Permian, we'll be more than doubling the size of our average package size of wells from two to five. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Okay. And just specifically with that, and when you look at sort of that, I guess what you said, the slower start in January, that was a big part of it is just those increased pad sizes specifically in the Permian? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, Scott. This is Billy Helms. Yeah, basically as we ramp up activity there in the first half of the year and start drilling longer laterals in these bigger packages of wells, it requires that we build inventory for our completion crews more so than we've seen in the past. So that delay is really what's affected our first quarter's production. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Understood. And as my follow-up then, you did talk about uses of cash flow priorities and not wanting to push it where it impairs returns. What is the trigger point that you start seeing things degraded? Is it more service cost rising? Is it just lack of infrastructure? What is the bottleneck on using some more capital to invest currently? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Scott, it's really a couple of things. One is, certainly, the service costs, we are not interested in paying high prices for services. And so we work really hard, like we've done this year, to mitigate increases, and actually going to decrease them this year \u2013 total well costs, we're going to decrease total well costs by locking in really strong services at below-market rates. And the other thing is going too fast and outpacing our technical learning curve. And so in every one of these plays \u2013 and we've been doing this for two decades now \u2013 we've learned to take a systematic approach and not really switch in to what some people would call a manufacturing mode, because we want to continue to learn and we want to continue to get better. And if you just lock yourself into a manufacturing mode, you could be locking yourself into drilling a large amount of wells in the wrong way. And so we continue to learn to place the wells at different spacing vertically and laterally, and our goal is to maximize NPV on those. So that can only go at a certain pace too. So we're very careful. Everything we do in the company is driven by increasing returns, and that is the focus of, as you all know, EOG and that's what we're doing. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Understood. Appreciate that. Thanks. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good. Thanks. Maybe as a follow-up to what you were just talking about there on learnings, we've seen a few companies over the course of this quarter walk back spacing expectations a little bit in the Permian Basin. How have your views evolved as you've continued to get more data out of the basin? And maybe thoughts on how you're thinking about your evolving base case in terms of spacing your wells per unit. Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, Ryan, this is Ezra again. In the Permian Basin, it's still relatively early in the play development. We're still testing a lot of concepts on spacing and staggering of our targets. It's definitely area-dependent, and then target-dependent as well. But, as we've said in the past, in the Wolfcamp oil window, we're seeing good results with spacings from 500 to 660-foot spacing. It's a little bit different down like in our combo, Wolfcamp combo area, where spacing ranges from more like a 800-foot to 1,000-foot spacing. But again, before we really come out with any greater detail on that, the slowdown in activity kind of slowed down our data collection on that, but we continue to push forward with it. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And maybe a follow-up to that. Can you talk about the trends in lateral length in the Permian in 2018? I think you're still \u2013 you're targeting a little over 6,000 feet, but a relatively wide range across some of your wells. What's the limiting factor in you guys going higher? Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, Ryan, again, this is Ezra. So our lateral length actually, so we were able to extend it 20% year-over-year and we're anticipating about another 10% increase here in 2018. Really, as we just continue to make acreage trades and block up our acreage across the basin, you'll continue to see those lateral lengths getting longer and longer. At this point, that's kind of the limiting factor. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. I'll leave it there. Operator : And we'll go next to Subash Chandra with Guggenheim. Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thank you. As you've doubled the package size in the Permian, I think, two to five as you said, do you think at some point you have to get to a cubed style development, for lack of a better term? And the benefits and costs of doing that, do you think that's necessary or can you more moderately increase the package sizes over time and accomplish your objectives? Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, this is Ezra again. No, I think the last part that you said is right. I think we can more moderately expand the package size. Like I said, it's a real balance there trying to get the package sizes large enough, so that you're maximizing the operational efficiencies that exist with multi-well operations. But we definitely don't want to get them so large that we have to sacrifice being able to \u2013 the flexibility to integrate real-time data collection and learnings into our subsequent well packages. And then also we don't want to get into situations where we end up overbuilding facilities to try and solve temporary issues or anything like that. We're much more focused on integrating our learnings from well-to-well. And then the last thing to think about too is, as Bill mentioned previously and being cautious not to get into manufacturing mode, is the size of these packages are going to be very area dependent. It's really complex geologically, and as we've discussed before, we focus a lot on precision targeting and working out the stratigraphy and the complexities of the geology to make sure we're putting these wells in the best targets. Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. And my follow-up is in the Wolfcamp or in the Delaware, you've sidestepped all the issues it seems like that have hobbled some of your competitors from sand to takeaway, to inflation, et cetera. And I think what you've messaged on this call is that your real hurdles are internal in managing IRRs and learnings and the like. Did I hear that correctly, or are there some speed bumps that you're concerned about that are external, whether it's water or some other things that maybe we haven't considered? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: I think, Subash, you're correct. We're really in great shape in the Permian, sand, water, takeaway, all those things. And the real thing we're focused on and really what makes a difference in our well productivity versus the industry is our ability to execute in a complex geologic setting, and continue to stay flexible and to learn and to continue to focus on cost reduction. And so those are the things that, I think, we've been fortunate to learn over our two decades in drilling horizontal wells and we're putting those to good use in the Permian. Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bob Morris with Citi. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Bill, looking at slide 13 on the Wolfcamp six-month production from the wells, you extended the data out through July versus November before and I notice the average rate dropped a little bit here. And I know some of that's in moving more of your wells to Reeves County. But how much of that is just the child/parent relationship, particularly as you go from two- to five-well packages? How much of that are you seeing? And how much is the degradation on going from unbounded or parent wells to child wells in that situation? Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, Bob, this is Ezra again. I think you hit the nail on the head. That's kind of more a reflection of increasing here recently the percentage of wells drilled down on our combo play in Reeves County. I think the issue of parent/child well performance isn't really anything new. It's a challenge that operators have been faced with since horizontal resource plays have been developing, and we've been collecting data on this topic for almost 20 years now throughout our multiple basins and multiple plays. I think there's not really a single variable to eliminate the issue. I think the way we approach it is it begins with the well planning, that's to say the spacing and targeting, making sure that you get that right for the geology that you're in. Different targets obviously respond differently to how much they affect that parent/child relationship. And then also there are things you can do on the completions and production side, certain techniques and designs, again, to alleviate some of those issues. Operator : And we'll go next to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Morning. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I wanted to start in the Eagle Ford. I think in your comments, you mentioned the Eagle Ford is where you saw some of the best rates of return in the company during 2017, and I wondered why not shift more activity there relative to the Permian Basin. I think the increase in rig count's about one in the Eagle Ford, but more substantially in the Delaware. Can you just talk a little bit more about that capital allocation decision, and then how the rates of return, inflationary pressures, and ability to execute compare in the Eagle Ford relative to the Delaware? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, Brian, this is Billy Helms. Yeah, in the Eagle Ford, we're very pleased with the rate of return and the program. And this last year was a really good year for them where they continue to learn and develop our learnings there quite a bit over the last year. The growth there in the Eagle Ford \u2013 the Eagle Ford is really a pretty stable platform for us to continue to slightly grow over the time as we develop that, but we've got some of these other areas that we're also very interested in growing and applying our learnings to to continue to benefit from the learnings that really kind of started in the Eagle Ford. We're also, as a result of the activity in the Eagle Ford, we are improving our well cost, and the well count is actually going up more so than rigs in the Eagle Ford versus that. The other thing that's important to note on the Eagle Ford too, remember, is that 99% of our acreage there is HBP, so we have a lot of flexibility in how we manage our activity levels in the Eagle Ford. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up question is with regards to well cost and efficiencies. You've highlighted your expectations for well costs to fall in a couple of these key basins, and some of the reasons for that I think you mentioned was because of below-market contracts. How much of this is timing, i.e., would go away all else equal in 2019 and your costs would rise versus a sustainable example of EOG's skill that could continue beyond 2018? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, Brian, this is Billy Helms, again. Yeah, I think the thing that's unique about EOG in some aspects, we did lock in services certainly at the low cost. A lot of people are able to take advantage of the service cost declines, but I think the thing that's a little bit unique in EOG is our culture of continuous improvement that we really focus relentlessly on improving every aspect of our business, our drilling times, lowering our completed well costs by completing more of the lateral every day with each stage. We also self-source 25% to 30% of our well costs, so we do a lot of things that enable us to continue to make steady improvements in our well costs. And we can't be more proud of our operational teams as they continue to strive to do that. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, I'd just like to add to what Billy said. I think, historically \u2013 I've been with the company 39 years now, I don't really remember many years when well costs were going up in EOG. And so I think we've got a lot of confidence in our ability to continue to hold and even reduce costs as we go forward. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Phillips Johnston with Capital One. Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks. Just to follow-up on the topic of parent/child wells, a few operators have recently highlighted a decline in per-well productivity and EURs as infill drilling has occurred. I think you guys have previously talked about seeing similar trends in the Bakken just as infill drilling has occurred, but I wanted to get a sense of what you're seeing in the Eagle Ford. I realize that per-well productivity as a whole in the play has continued to improve throughout 2017, but what are you seeing in areas where the number of wells per section is approaching your 16-well target? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: I would say, Phillips, we have continually learned to have variable targets as we develop the Eagle Ford. We have the Lower Eagle Ford and the Upper Eagle Ford and the multiple targets, and we continue to learn to place those better. And we also are learning to manage the parent/child relationship even down to wells that are as close as 200 feet apart. So it's managing the pattern sizes, the timing of the completions, the targeting, and the way that you spatially locate the targets in these W patterns. We're really proud of our folks in San Antonio. They continue to make really strong technical learning in the Eagle Ford and our costs are going down too. So our Eagle Ford returns just consistently every year are going up, and that's the way we want to develop all of our assets, that we're constantly improving and making them better. Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just on the return on capital employed target, nice to see the projected uptick to 10% or higher this year. I'm wondering what that number would look like if you ran the same price deck of $48 by $2.70 that you show for the last three years on page 4 of the slide deck? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: We're not going to give a number out on ROCE, but I'll tell you, we feel very good about that double-digit ROCE. The company is in great position this year and we're really confident that we're going to be able to deliver that number. Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll go next to David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Thinking about your cash margins and your differential guidance, early in the year you benefited by LLS, but your full year guide, is that incorporating a wider differential for things like the Delaware as that grows? Or can you talk some about how you think about your long-dated differentials as other regions beyond the Eagle Ford really start really dominating growth? D. Lance Terveen - EOG Resources, Inc.: Hi, David. This is Lance. Yeah, as we look at our guidance, we take all those considerations. So like we talked about, 100% of our Eagle Ford is all priced on LLS. And you can look at that forward curve, we've priced that into our guidance. And then as you think about the Delaware Basin, with our transportation capacity that we have, we talk a little bit \u2013 you see on slide 24, 20% of that we're able to get into the Corpus market, which is what we see as a Brent or an LLS type marker. So we've factored all that into our guidance for what you're seeing today for the full year for 2018. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : And so do you think that a range at the end of the year should carry forward in that more similar to the full year 2018 as opposed to where we are just early \u2013 more thinking 2019 and 2020 free cash flow generation is what becomes important? D. Lance Terveen - EOG Resources, Inc.: The crystal ball so far there, David, in terms of when we look at the forward curves and where that's trading, we look at 2019 too, same thing for gas like the crude. So we've got the guidance out there for 2018 and we bake that all the way through in terms of for crude and also for gas. So everywhere from the Rockies to the Delaware Basin, even into the Eagle Ford, each one of those markets, that's all factored into our guidance. And what we've been very positive about is, as you've seen, the Rockies has definitely strengthened. So I think across the board when you look at all of our divisions and our domestic oil production, we've seen strength in all the divisions. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : All right. Thanks. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Sameer Panjwani with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. I wanted to get a bit granular here at the end on the CapEx budget. So I'm just kind of looking through it, it looks like the exploration and development budget $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion. Just kind of taking an average of that over 690 wells kind of implies $6.7 million. Go back to 2017, I think the average kind of works out to $5.9 million. And I know there's lot of moving parts in terms of longer laterals and at the same time you guys are lowering normalized laterals well costs. Just trying to figure out what exactly is kind of causing this shift. I think a big piece of it is that you guys are shifting more activity to the Delaware, which is a higher per well cost and that might be bringing up the average, but I wanted to get your thoughts there. Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, this is Billy Helms. I think what you're seeing is a result of the increased activity there in the Delaware Basin relative to the overall program. We're increasing our activity mostly to grow the potential we see in the Delaware. So the mix of wells within the capital budget is different. Then the other thing that's in our capital budget, and Bill alluded to this earlier, we are testing some new plays. And so early on in new plays, we do collect some science data, cores and microseismic in places, 3D seismic, those kind of things that add into our capital program that would not be typical in just a normal development program. Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then on slide 19, outlook through 2020 it looks like you can achieve this at roughly $5 a barrel lower based on the 2018 capital efficiency that's being implied. Is this the right way to think about it? And do you have any plans to update this outlook going forward? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: You're looking at it correctly. We're getting better every year. The 2017 metrics versus the 2018 metrics, the 2018 metrics are better in every way. So we're able to deliver a very, very strong growth at lower oil prices going forward. So you're looking at that correctly. We have a very strong, I think incredible, high return inventory in place, and we really believe our quality of inventory is going to increase over time and our costs are going to continue to go down. So I think what you can look for us to do is just keep updating this 2020 outlook that we have, and I think we're very hopeful that we will keep outperforming the outlook guidance going forward. Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. If I can squeeze in one last one. I know you guys talked about 27 wells online in January. But any additional color you can provide on the expected total for the first quarter? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: We haven't really looked at how many wells per quarter. I just know that the well count in the first quarter is low relative to the rest of the quarters, and it's really due to the ramp-up and activity that we see at the start of the year. And drilling these larger packages with longer laterals and getting the inventory back in where we need it for this level of activity, you just have less wells coming online in the first quarter relative to the rest of the year. So we're very confident in our plan and the volumes that we played out and the guidance we've given. And we expect to be able to deliver that within our program we've laid out. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yes. In closing, just like to conclude by saying, 2017 results were outstanding and we believe 2018 will be even better. The company is driven by strong returns and is poised to deliver in 2018 and beyond. We have a sustainable business model and we're excited about EOG's ability to create long-term shareholder value. So thank you for listening, and thank you for your support. Operator : Thank you. Everyone, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

This morning we'll discuss topics in the following order. Bill Thomas will review our corporate strategy and cash flow priorities. I'll cover our capital structure and dividend outlook. Billy Helms will cover first quarter operating and financial highlights, and Ezra Yacob, Lance Terveen and David Trice, will review asset levels results and marketing developments across our most active plays. Then Bill will provide concluding remarks. Here's Bill Thomas. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. EOG is a disciplined, high-return, organic growth company. Delivering high returns and strong growth is a rare combination not often found in any industry. With our low-cost organic exploration expertise, the company is currently developing nine premium geologic plays across six basins in North America. The power of our premium-only drilling strategy is reflected in our first quarter performance. We earned a company record direct after-tax rate of return of 150% on $1.5 billion of total invested capital. The ability of EOG to generate 150% direct after-tax rate of return on that much capital in one quarter is remarkable compared to any standard. Strong execution delivered volumes on the high end of our forecast, and most of our operating costs came in below targeted ranges. We are well on our way to executing our 2018 plan that will deliver 18% oil growth and generate over $1.5 billion of free cash flow at $60 oil. We believe disciplined reinvestment of cash flow and high rate of return drilling is fundamental to creating significant long-term value. We've been very consistent and clear about this priority for our cash flow. We believe it is by far the most shareholder-friendly decision we can make. Disciplined investment in premium oil, defined as having strong returns at $40 oil, allows EOG to deliver strong oil growth with free cash flow at $50 oil and substantial free cash flow at $60 oil. Along with reinvesting in high return wells, we've outlined the following priorities for utilization of free cash flow. First, an impeccable balance sheet is fundamental to a commodity-exposed business. Having low debt strengthens the sustainability of our dividend and maintains our investment flexibility through the volatility of the commodity price cycle. Concerning flexibility, let me be clear on one point. We have no interest in expensive corporate M&A in any commodity price environment. EOG is an organic exploration company with the ability to continually add premium drilling through low-cost organic leasing and low-cost tactical property additions. And it's important to emphasize here that our premium hurdle rate applies across the board to everything we do. We have set a target to reduce total debt outstanding by $3 billion over the next several years. Tim Driggers will provide more detail on our debt reduction plans in a moment. Second, we will target dividend growth above our historical 19% compounded annual rate. We have a long history of delivering a dividend that we can maintain throughout the volatility of the commodity price lifecycle. The result has been 17 increases in 19 years without a single dividend cut. We believe our prospects for cash flow growth will support strong dividend growth that is sustainable through price cycles. In summary, EOG is a high-return organic growth company. Our ability to grow production and cash flow, produce double-digit ROCE, and deliver cash returns to shareholders through strong dividend growth simultaneously is rare. That's a truly unique combination, not just in the E&P industry, but in any industry. It is perfectly aligned with our ultimate goal : to create significant shareholder value. I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers for more on our capital structure and dividend. Timothy K. Driggers - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Bill. Over the last three years, we have reset the company to thrive at much lower oil and gas prices. As a result, we are uniquely positioned to generate a meaningful amount of free cash flow. EOG now has the opportunity to take the next steps to further strengthen the balance sheet and increase the rate of dividend growth. Currently, our balance sheet is strong at 28% leverage and $6.4 billion of total debt. Our target is to further reduce total debt by $3 billion. The $3 billion of debt reduction is a prudent target in a cyclical capital-intensive business. We expect to achieve that target over the next several years by repaying bonds as they mature, using cash generated from operations. This measured pace of debt reduction provides room to fund strong dividend growth. We were pleased to make it through the last downturn without cutting the dividend and without a dilutive equity offering to shore up the balance sheet. Whatever future commitments EOG makes must be sustainable for the long term. This means we must consider the strength of our balance sheet and the sustainability of the dividend through low commodity price scenarios, not just against the rising level of oil prices that exists today. The dividend is an important element of EOG's financial strategy. We've increased the dividend at a compounded annual rate of 19% since 1999. With a lower breakeven cost structure and a strong balance sheet, we're now targeting a dividend growth rate that exceeds the 19% historical rate. Our dividend growth strategy signals our confidence in the future profitability of the company, provides shareholders with a tangible form of return on their investment, and imparts a measure of discipline on the organization. EOG creates shareholder value through operations and not financial engineering. A strong financial position is a competitive advantage as we seek to sustain our performance through the volatility of the commodity price cycle. The company can do this with a straightforward financial structure and an impeccable balance sheet. This will leave EOG positioned to keep its financial commitments in future downturns, including sustaining a more ambitious dividend. Up next to provide details on our operational performance is Billy Helms. Lloyd W. Helms - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Tim. 2018 is all about maintaining our disciplined capital growth program. In the first quarter, we delivered at or above our production targets and have laid the groundwork to deliver our forecasted well cost targets. We are maintaining our full-year capital guidance of $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion, growing oil production 18%, growing total production 16%, reducing well cost 5%, reducing debt, producing free cash flow, and most importantly, delivering double-digit return on capital employed. There are a number of operational accomplishments from the first quarter I'd like to highlight. We increased activity earlier in the year and are now operating about 40 rigs across six basins. We still expect to average about 39 rigs for the year. Our operating teams in each area are quickly moving the new rigs in our fleet up the learning curve to deliver sustainable efficiency improvements that will yield benefits the rest of the year. In our larger development programs, we moved to larger packages of wells with longer laterals, completing more than 150 net wells with over 30 of those brought to sales in the last week of the quarter. About two-thirds of the wells in the Delaware Basin were in packages of six wells or more. In Eagle Ford, over half the wells were in packages of five wells or more. In the coming quarters, we will be competing several 6 to 10 well packages in both plays, which will improve our operational efficiency and maximize the net present value of our acreage. Initiating this development from larger multi-well packages results in a production profile that is more weighted to the second half of the year as can be seen in our full year production guidance. As a result, we anticipate that our growth will be more heavily weighted to the third quarter than any other quarter this year. We improved our completions efficiency, increased the number of wells completed per month by each completion crew. This allows us the option to consider reducing the pressure pumping equipment utilized this year. And finally, we continue to meaningfully lower sand, water, flowback and facility cost. As a result of the progress we made during the first quarter, we remain confident that we will be able to deliver the targeted 5% well cost reductions we discussed at our last earnings call. Controlling costs is key to a successful commodity business. Year-after-year, we have been able to consistently control costs. And that is true whether we are at the top or bottom of the cycle. There are a few good reasons for that. First, we have a unique benefit of having worked in multiple basins through their lifecycles for almost 20 years. That experience provides valuable foresight. We take our very forward-looking growth plan and analyze the market to anticipate when and where we might see tightness from the services industry, takeaway, relative demand for oil, gas and NGLs, and many other factors. These hard earned lessons over the past two decades have given us the experience to quickly adjust our plans to the ever changing conditions in the industry. Second, the scale of our operations provides several pricing benefits as well as efficiency opportunities. The more wells we drill in any given area, the better we get at drilling those wells. Drilling and completing hundreds of wells over and over is how our talented engineers generate ideas for innovation. It also allows us to invest time and money into unbundling services and, if advantageous, bringing those efforts in-house. That includes everything from building our own water sourcing and gathering infrastructure to self-sourcing or procuring raw materials directly from the manufacturer. Our self-sourcing capabilities started with sand and now grown to include tubulars, chemicals and drilling mud. Third, we run a conservative business both operationally and financially. Operationally, we avoid going so fast that we start to degrade our return profile by paying too much for services or allowing ourselves to get inefficient. Financially, we're committed to a strong balance sheet. Low debt combined with scale allows us to commit to services when others in the industry may be hesitant to do so. This is exactly what occurred last year when we were able to lock in completion spreads at a low cost as one of the few E&Ps willing to commit capital. Looking ahead to 2019, we'll continue to opportunistically lock in services by proactive engagement with our suppliers. We'll also continue to optimize well package size and increase the use of multi-well pads and zipper fracs which will speed operations and well transitions. Finally, we see more opportunity to optimize our sand program and accelerate water we use to further reduce cost. We have line of sight into these and many more areas to reduce cost and improve efficiencies well into 2019. I'll turn the call over to Ezra Yacob who will update you on the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin plays. Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Billy. The Eagle Ford continues to prove itself quarter-after-quarter as a world-class oil play and EOG's premier asset. In the first quarter, we brought 72 wells online with average spacing of about 300 feet and average payout of seven months. We believe this operational and financial performance in the Eagle Ford is unmatched in the industry. We increased our rig count to 11 in the first quarter and realized a 5% increase in footage drilled per day, accompanied by a 5% decrease in cost per foot. Not to be outdone, our completions team also increased operational efficiencies and is forecasting further cost savings with the addition of local sand sources. Wells on the eastern Eagle Ford acreage position averaged 1,810 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the first 30 days online and wells on our western acreage averaged 1,375 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the first 30 days. While the wells in our western acreage position have lower initial rates, the combination of less faulting and our contiguous acreage position allows for consistently longer laterals than in the East, which drives operational efficiencies. Therefore, the wells across our entire 520,000 net acres in the oil window are all equally competitive on a rate of return basis. The Eagle Ford is a key contributor to flexibility of our diverse portfolio of assets providing the company many options. We modeled several growth forecasts assuming no productivity improvements or cost reductions. If we chose to pursue more growth in Eagle Ford, our current inventory of well locations and large acreage position would support more than 10 years of development. No North American basin compares with the Eagle Ford for low transportation cost and access to Gulf Coast pricing. Currently, 85% of our oil production in this basin flows through EOG-owned gathering systems, and all of our oil from the Eagle Ford receives LLS prices, which averaged about a $4 premium to WTI during the first quarter. This basin continues to deliver consistently outstanding results. Furthermore, we are still reducing cost through internally designed, innovative technology advances. Therefore, we are convinced the Eagle Ford still has significant upside even as it enters its ninth year of development. In our Austin Chalk play, we continue to drill some of the most prolific and highest return wells in the company. The first quarter development program earned over 150% direct after-tax rate of return. The average 30-day production from the eight net wells brought online during the first quarter was 2,750 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The Austin Chalk target lies just above the Eagle Ford in our South Texas acreage and, as such, benefits from our operational efficiencies and knowledge of the area. Production from Austin Chalk wells also benefits from lower operating costs and Gulf Coast pricing due to our existing infrastructure. We're on track to complete 25 net wells in 2018. In the Delaware Basin, our results have been just as strong. In the Wolfcamp, the 58 wells brought to sales in the first quarter averaged 1,925 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the first 30 days, and delivered less than a $9 per barrel of oil equivalent direct finding and development cost. The nine wells brought online in the Bone Spring delivered solid results, producing an average of 1,645 barrels of oil equivalent per day in our first 30 days. And in the Leonard, we brought on three wells to sales. The average 30-day rates were well over 2,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day on 4,300-foot laterals. That production per foot rivals well performance typically seen from our Austin Chalk wells in South Texas. One of our constant studies across all basins is determining the most efficient number of wells to drill and complete together as a package. This work is essential to maximize the recovery and NPV of the whole asset, and is particularly important for a complex basin of stacked pay such as the Delaware Basin. Each play has an optimum number of wells that both captures operational efficiencies and minimizes parent-child productivity effects, without sacrificing net present value to either the long cycle times or large production facilities needed to handle high initial volumes. During the first quarter, we averaged four wells per package versus two last year. We expect to further increase the average to five by year end. Larger well packages necessitate a larger inventory of wells needed to stay ahead of our completion crews. So much of January was spent ramping up drilling activity and increasing inventory to prepare for our completions scheduled this year. We increased our rig fleet 20%, exiting the quarter operating 20 rigs in the basin. And we are realizing the increased efficiencies of larger well packages on both the drilling and completion side. Our Delaware Basin team has been diligently optimizing our completions operations and has achieved a 24% increase in stages per month per completion crew. And we're beginning to realize cost savings associated with increased use of both local sand and recycled produced water in our completions. The State Magellan 722H-28H wells located in the over-pressured Wolfcamp oil window of Loving County, Texas illustrate our achievements drilling well packages. This 500-foot spaced to 7-well package took approximately 65 days from initial spud to first sales. The average 30-day rates for these 4,700-foot stimulated laterals were 2,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We completed 157 total stages on this group of wells and pumped more than 80 million pounds of sand over the course of 14 days. Furthermore, 100% of the water used during the stimulations was sourced from reused produced water. The outstanding operations performance and well productivity delivered an average well payout of 5.5 months. Next up is Lance Terveen to discuss our takeaway positioning. D. Lance Terveen - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thank you, Ezra. I'd like to bring everyone up to speed since our last call on EOG's pricing mix for our crude oil and natural gas sales in the Permian, infrastructure buildout and takeaway positioning. Our 2018 Delaware Basin oil and natural gas production will have minimal exposure to in-basin pricing. Only 25% of our in-basin crude production is exposed to Midland pricing. This translates to less than 10% exposure for EOG's total U.S. oil production. Furthermore, we supplemented physical capacity with additional price protection with Mid-Cush basis swaps. On the natural gas side, less than 20% of in-basin production is exposed to Waha Hub pricing, which translates to about 5% exposure when viewed on a total U.S. production basis. We are in similar shape for our Delaware Basin production next year. Only 20% of crude production is exposed to Midland pricing and about 20% of natural gas production is exposed to Waha, which is manageable risk when viewed on a total U.S. production basis. So we're in great shape, and historically we have always been able to consistently anticipate the infrastructure needed to support growth. Similar to our past experiences in the Barnett, Bakken, and Eagle Ford, an early-mover strategy in the Delaware Basin is paying off. We've successfully diversified our marketing options with physical firm takeaway to protect flow assurance and benefit from higher price realizations for both crude and natural gas sales. Please see slide 18 of our investor presentation for a history of our industry-leading oil price realizations. On our last earnings call, we referenced the new Conan Oil Gathering system and terminal. This system has been in the works since 2016 and was placed into service on schedule during the first quarter of this year. Between the gathering system and short-haul dedicated truck offloads, we anticipate $50 million-plus in savings per year. Our goal by year end is to have up to 80% of our production on the gathering system in our core areas, which will have the added benefit of freeing up trucking availability. In 2018, the oil terminal will have four market connections. A fifth connection to a newly announced long-haul pipeline that will service the Houston, Corpus Christi, and export markets is planned to be in service in late 2019. On gas takeaway, our early-mover strategy allowed us to lock up transportation capacity at well below today's market rates. Also, in lockstep with our residue gas transportation capacity, we secure sufficient plant processing, with each plant location strategically fitting with the footprint of our gas gathering system throughout our acreage position. At each of the centralized hubs along our gathering system, we have the option to deliver our gas to up to four different processing plants. This gives EOG the ability to source our gas to multiple plants that also feed our takeaway capacity away from the Permian Basin. We are confident our early-mover strategy will allow us to move forward with our development and growth plan in the Delaware Basin and realize attractive netbacks, bridging us to 2020 when adequate infrastructure will be in place to service the broader basin. Here's David Trice to review the progress we've made in the Rockies and Mid-Continent. David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Lance. Well costs continue to drop for our Rockies plays. The efficiency gains we are making in both the Powder River Basin and DJ Basin are astounding, particularly considering they are in addition to the incredible progress made last year. In just one quarter, we have reached and beat well cost targets in some of our Rockies plays. Tremendous progress has been made in both drilling and completions to reduce days on location that translate directly to cost savings. Overall, drilling days are down 70% since the beginning of the downturn in 2014 for the DJ, Powder River Basin, and Williston Basin. This is a powerful testament to the great sustainable efficiency gains our teams have made during the last several years. Recently, normalized spud-to-TD drilling days in the Powder River Basin are down from 9 days on average in 2017 to about 7.5 days for the first quarter of 2018. During that time, completion efficiencies have more than kept pace with drilling. Stages per day and footage per day are up a whopping 50% in the first quarter versus the 2017 average. This includes a record day in the DJ Basin of 26 stages pumped on a four-well pad in a single 24-hour period. That record-breaking pad averaged 21 stages a day for the entire job. Our cost performance in the DJ Basin Codell has set the bar for the rest of the company. Some notable wells that we highlighted in last night's press release are the three-well Flatbow package that IP-ed at over 1,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day from 3,900 foot laterals, and averaged just $2.9 million per well. We also turned on a four-well 9,500-foot Big Sandy package that averaged over 1,300 barrels a day equivalent per well, with a well cost of $3.5 million per well. These seven low-cost Rockies wells are earning an average direct rate return of over 250%. Our cost structure in the Rockies and Bakken gives us a competitive advantage and creates significant upside potential to add to our premium inventory in the future. The Anadarko Basin Woodford oil window is the latest addition to our diverse portfolio of premium oil assets. We are increasing activity and building working inventory to support our 25 net well program this year. Our latest well to come online is the Terri 1621 #1H, which is a 2-mile lateral that delivered over 1,100 barrels of oil per day in its first 30 days. We currently have four rigs running in the Woodford. And as we move into development mode in the basin, we expect to have a number of new well results to share in the future. We will also be testing multiple spacing patterns in order to determine the optimal spacing to maximize NPV per development unit. We are optimistic the Woodford play has upside potential for inventory additions and certainly returns as we increase efficiencies and reduce cost. Plays like the Woodford enhance the diversity of our portfolio and provide us flexibility to consistently deliver high-return production growth. Now I'll turn it back over to Bill. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, David. I have a few closing thoughts. Number one, our first quarter results have positioned EOG to have record-breaking direct rates of return on capital investments in 2018. We are going to remain disciplined and stay focused on improving returns going forward. Number two, we're on track to continue reducing both operating cost and well costs. Number three, with our diversified assets, forward-looking marketing arrangements, and advanced infrastructure planning, we are in excellent position to avoid any significant takeaway issues or negative product price differentials in the Permian or in any of our other active plays. Number four, with two decades of horizontal experience and technology advancements behind us, we are developing sweet-spot acreage positions with our latest precision targeting techniques and determining optimal spacing patterns to produce industry-leading well results and per acre net present value. And finally, EOG has never been in a better position to deliver long-term shareholder value. We have the largest and highest quality drilling inventory in the U.S., and it continues to grow much faster than we drill it. We are a low-cost leader today and we will continue to lower costs as we go forward. We are delivering record-setting returns on capital invested, improving corporate ROCE, along with strong production growth and substantial free cash flow. EOG is a high return organic growth company delivering sustainable long-term shareholder value. Thanks for listening and now we'll go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. And our first question, we'll hear it from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. Bill, no one's going to fault you for wanting to reduce your debt or increase your dividends over time, but I did want to ask you one question. As you execute your premium drilling strategy, your returns on capital employed are now moving into the double-digits, and I was wondering if you could talk about weighing a buyback above your cost of capital versus reducing debt what looks to be in the 6% to 7% range? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Arun, we're committed to doing what's right for the shareholders. Our senior management team and our board are significant EOG shareholders and we're aligned with investors. And we're constantly evaluating what's best to create long-term shareholder value. Currently, with the improving commodity prices, we believe investing in high returns and reducing our debt and strong sustainable dividend growth are the best ways to create long-term shareholder value. So at the moment, we're very confident in that plan and we believe that will be the best avenue to create shareholder value. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, great. And just reduction in debt, does that suggest maybe keeping some dry powder for as you execute your exploration drilling program or to look at potentially other opportunities like you did with the Yates package? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Arun, we don't plan any corporate M&As. That's just not one of our game plans. As you know, we're a very organic company. We've got a lot of confidence in our organic exploration effort, and corporate M&As or just something that would be really not in our game plan at this time. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. Operator : And next we'll move to Bob Morris with Citi. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. A bit of a follow-up here, Billy, you've always said that you would spend 100% of your cash flow unless you saw some sharp degradation in efficiencies, and obviously $1.5 billion of excess cash flow is quite a significant amount. You starting out the year what you plan to average for the full year on the rig count, so what precludes you from stepping up activity or adding some rigs in some of these key areas given the sort of returns you're seeing here as we move through the year? Lloyd W. Helms - EOG Resources, Inc.: Bob, this is Billy Helms. First of all, we remain committed to stay within our capital guidance. We're very much on track with our plan as we laid it out. Actually, our rate of capital spend is directly in line with what we laid out at the start of the year. And we've already talked about the benefits of moving to these larger packages of wells. And as a result, the front end of the year is more loaded towards capital spend with the production more weighted towards the back half of the year. So, at this moment, yeah, we're very pleased with where we are headed and we don't really anticipate increasing activity above where we currently are. We're still guiding towards that average rig count of 39 and staying within our capital guidance. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll hear from Irene Haas with Imperial Capital. Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC : Yes, good morning. So I have a question for the Eagle Ford trend which you guys definitely was the first mover, and it's been going on nine years, I was wondering what is the organic growth rate for this trend in 2018. And also regarding the Austin Chalk, I want to understand what are the key gating factors that would lead you to fully develop this concept, and when would the Chalk be a meaningful contributor to your Eagle Ford trend growth. Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Irene, this is Ezra Yacob. And I don't think we're going to spend any time today guiding to the direct growth on that asset right now. But what I will say about the Eagle Ford is the upside we see there just involves our continued progression of integrating the data that we've collected over the development cycle that we've had there. We continue to integrate both high-graded geologic mapping completions data back into of our geologic model, and it helps kind of drive our precision targeting as we develop even finer scale and high graded targets. And then also with respect to the Austin Chalk, we've gone a little bit slow making announcements on that because, geologically, it is a bit more complex than the Eagle Ford. I would say that it already is contributing in a pretty good way to not only our returns but also in 2017, both the Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk actually showed just a little bit of growth year-over-year. And so we're happy with our pace of development there in the Austin Chalk and when we have more information on that, we're a little more comfortable with it, we'll provide greater detail. Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC : Okay. May I ask one more question? So are you generating organic growth out of the Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk trend in 2018? Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Irene, without getting into specific details, we do plan to grow that asset this year. Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC : Thank you. Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: We'll be doing that at a pace... Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC : Sorry? Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: I was just going to finish up and say, we'll be doing that at a pace commensurate with where we can go ahead and continue to integrate our learnings, and do that really with a focus on returns first. Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC : Understood, thank you so much. Operator : And next we move on to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you, good morning. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Good morning. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I wanted to start on the well cost front. How can we define the more secular versus timing impact of your ability to use your scale to gain preferred services pricing exposure? Specifically, if you're not seeing the inflation in cost in 2018 because you locked in services cost early, what level of inflation would we see in 2019 when you need to recontract, or is there a quantifiable secular advantage? Lloyd W. Helms - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yes, Brian. This is Billy Helms. What we can give you is \u2013 it's a little bit early to talk about guiding for 2019. So let me give you a little bit of color on where we are for 2018. First of all, as you're aware, we locked in about 60% of our well cost with the services we have locked in so far, with drilling really preferred providers on the drilling side and the completion side. And we self-sourced quite a bit of that too, about 25% of well cost is self-sourced. So the progress we're making and I guess the confidence we would have in lowering our well cost in 2018 \u2013 we talked a little bit about how we're lowering cost in each one of the plays, I think for Permian, we added quite a few rigs and so we're starting to see the operational performance on those rigs get to the metrics that we like to see in our rig fleet. Completions are already down about 2.3% for the first part of the year. On the Eagle Ford, of our drilling cost is already down about 5% and the completions are expected to follow. And then we've made tremendous progress in the Rockies, both on the drilling and completion side, in lowering our well cost anywhere between 4% and 5%. So I think overall, we're very pleased with where we're headed. And we have a long history \u2013 just speaking of 2019 again, we have a long history, each year as we go into the year, we anticipate what the trends are going to be and we get ahead of them and try to work with our preferred providers to lock up some services for the coming year. And I expect 2019 will be done the same way. It's a little bit early to really guide on where we'll be, but we're very confident that we'll be able to maintain our cost advantages as we go into the next year. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. And my follow-up goes back to the earlier discussion on the Eagle Ford, and I'm going to be trying to tie Bob and Irene's questions together. What would you need to see either in capital availability, rate of return or confidence in that precision targeting to allocate more capital to Eagle Ford? And do you need to exhaust your financial goals of reducing debt by $3 billion and delivering on that above 19% dividend growth before you would do that? Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Brian, this is Ezra again. Like I reiterated, I think we're happy with our plan and we're happy with where we're at, kind of executing on it and we're on track with it. As far as adding additional capital or redirecting capital to the Eagle Ford, I think \u2013 without guiding into future years, we have definitely run through a number of different forecast growth models, like I talked about in the opening statements, where if we choose to actually grow more aggressively there, we can certainly do that and we have the inventory and acreage position to do that for over 10 years at high returns. But as far as doing it within the year, I think it's safe to say that we're pretty happy with where we're at with our balanced approach across multiple basins to achieve our CapEx and volume growth goals for this year. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : And we'll move on to Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Well, thanks and good morning, everybody. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Good morning. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Bill, I wonder if I could go back to dividend policy, capital discipline, share buyback discussion or \u2013 not so much of last part. But I'm just \u2013 looking at the dividend policy going forward, what do you see is the competitive metrics, what's kind of the end game you're trying to get to there? And I just want to be clear on the $50 to $60 range you gave, I guess, a year or so ago, is $60 as a budget a kind of hard stop, so you should think of anything beyond that as going towards the balance sheet? And if that's the case, what happens longer term as it relates to incremental, let's call it, windfall cash flows? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Doug, I don't think we have some hurdle rate on the oil price. We've really reset the company to be very successful even in moderate prices going forward. And so the company is in a fantastic position now to make, I think, a strong statement to say that we're in a position to more aggressively grow our dividend than we ever have in the past. And we believe that our dividend is sustainable through the commodity cycles. And so the company is just in a fantastic position to both systematically reduce our debt and to grow our dividend very aggressively and sustainably in most commodity price situations. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : No question on the reset, I appreciate you tolerating another question on that issue. My follow-up is really on inventory. And I'm not challenging the discipline of the $40 hurdle for premium locations, but obviously some of the market may have a different view as to what the sustainable oil price is. And the question is really about inventory relative to your growth pace. If we had to run at $45 or a $50 number as the threshold for premium inventory, how would it change over the disclosure you've given so far? Does it go up 10% or does it double? And I'll leave it there, thanks. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: So I think first of all, we don't have any plans on changing our criteria. We're going to stick with $40 oil and $2.50 flat. That needs to be really clear going forward. That is a fundamental thing with EOG. If you looked at our entire inventory, which is quite substantial, I would say pretty much all of it would be 30% or better rate of return at $50. So it's a very high-quality total inventory. The inventory that we have in the company that's non-premium at $40 would be, I would say, equal to or better than the average inventory of the whole industry. So it's a very high-quality inventory set. And we have a lot of confidence that we'll continue to make improvements on the non-premium inventory and bring it to a level to where it will classify as premium at $40 oil. So we've got, again, a very sustainable cost reduction. It's not just a one-year thing. It's a very consistent cultural attribute of the company. And then we have a tremendous ability to continue to improve well productivity at the same time. So our goal is to convert a lot of that non-premium inventory into premium inventory as we go forward. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you, Bill, very clear. Operator : And we'll move on to Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks, good morning. Could I ask another question on your increasing the dividend rate versus the long-term rate? Is there a particular yield that when you guys step back would like to be at? It looks like you guys are running somewhere sub-1% right now, and some of the large peers are in that 1.5% range. Is there a target rate you'd like to see EOG at? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: No, Scott. We don't have a specific target other than just to say that on a percent increase on a yearly basis, we want to be above our historical average of 19% CAGR. So that's where we want to guide as we go forward. And we certainly, as I said before, we've got the ability to do that at relatively moderate oil prices and sustain that going forward. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, I appreciate that. And a little bit more on \u2013 it seems like you're definitely more front-end CapEx weighted, as you said, and in the back half ceasing that production. Can you talk about the cycle times that some of these larger Permian pads have? It looks like you averaged about four in the first quarter moving to five, but can you discuss maybe what those cycle times look like as you move from two to four to five? Lloyd W. Helms - EOG Resources, Inc.: Scott, this is Billy Helms. The cycle times, of course, vary by play. So in the Eagle Ford, it's a much shorter cycle time than, say, the Delaware Basin, just strictly because drilling times are much longer. And it also depends on the size of the pads. So certainly a 10-well pad might be a lot longer to cycle time than a 6-well package. And then it also depends on how many rigs and frac fleets we put on each package. So it's hard to give you, directionally, a certain number other than to say it takes several months to start drilling a pad \u2013 or a package of wells and bring that whole package to production. And as a result, it results in some lumpy nature of both capital spend and production. And that's why you see the production growth vary by quarter. And it's also why as we entered the year, we obviously had to build some inventory to be able to execute this plan, so the capital guidance is more weighted towards the front of the year than the second part of the year. And that's just the lumpy nature of this development. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Is that smoothed out in 2019 as you catch up with that inventory? Lloyd W. Helms - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yes, I think you'll still see a lumpiness to the overall production growth. But you won't see, I'd say, the delay we exhibited in the first quarter on a go-forward basis. You'll see it more just growth quarter-over-quarter as we move through the future. Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : I appreciate that. Thanks. Operator : And next we'll move to Leo Marinari (sic) [Mariani] with NatAlliance Securities. Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities LLC : Hey, guys. I was hoping you could address the Austin Chalk a little bit more. I know that you said that you're not trying to make extensive comments. I'm just trying to get a sense of the inventory there. It sounds like this is one of the best returning plays you guys have. Just curious, is this a couple years inventory, or is there a similar 10 years like the Eagle Ford? Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Leo, this is Ezra Yacob again. It's just really still pretty early in in the Austin Chalk. We are still doing a lot of testing on our well spacing, trying to determine the optimal spacing, how many precision targets we have in there. We've talked about in the past that it is different than the historical Austin Chalk play. It is a matrix \u2013 contributing kind of a matrix drive play. And so it's not quite as straightforward to use a lot of those historical learnings. The way we're developing it is different and it's unique. I'd say the initial productions look good. I know it seems like we put a lot of wells on but we'd like to be confident before we really come out with any detailed numbers on that. And like I said, when we have a little more detail on that, we'll certainly talk about it. Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities LLC : Okay, that's helpful. And I guess I just wanted to follow up on the Eagle Ford. You guys talked about some of the differing production rates you saw in the first quarter on the eastern wells versus the western wells, but then cited that returns are pretty similar. Just curious, does that kind of imply that maybe your well cost in West are lower than the East, what can you say sort of say about that? Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Leo, it's Ezra again. I think you hit the nail on the head there. The cost per foot \u2013 I tried to highlight in those opening remarks the contiguous nature of the western Eagle Ford acreage and a little bit less faulting out there, allows us the opportunity to drill longer wells and larger packages. It's a little bit less pressured and less shallow too. So in general, the costs are a little bit cheaper there. In the eastern Eagle Ford side of our acreage position though, we usually have wells with a little bit more robust rates, a little bit bigger wells, but it is a little bit more challenging drilling over there. It's a little bit deeper, a little bit extra pressure. And then in general, the well lengths tend to be just a little bit shorter due to both the layout of specific leases over there, but then also there's an increase in the faulting off to that eastern side. Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities LLC : Okay, that's helpful. And I guess just quick question on your dividend here. You talked about increases in the future. Should we expect to see a increase here in 2018? Are you more talking about evaluate that for 2019 and beyond? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Leo, we don't have any specifics on timing. Our board evaluates the business environment every quarter concerning the dividend. And I think what we're saying is we believe EOG is in the best shape we've ever been for sustainable, more aggressive dividend growth. So our board is eager to return cash to shareholders with a strong dividend growth. Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : And next we'll move to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Yes. Good morning, Bill, to you and your whole team there. You've covered this a little bit already in your comments in the Q&A, but I just want to go back to the comments you made in your opening when you said you had no interest in corporate M&A. And that's certainly been the pattern for you guys, with the one prominent exception of the Yates deal. And that was really a brilliant deal for you guys but I'm trying to understand a little bit more, is the Yates deal the exception that's not likely to come along again or should we be interpreting that you see the market or the opportunities differently from the way you did at that time? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: I think, Charles, what we are saying is that we've got extreme confidence in our ability to organically add new high potential at very low cost through our exploration efforts. In general, I think this year, we have a very robust exploration effort ongoing. And we've acquired a significant amount of low cost acreage in multiple plays, and we're testing numerous new plays with exploration or step up drilling this year. And so our organic machine is really in high gear and we have a lot of confidence in it. And we believe we can acquire significant, hopefully, even better drilling potential than we currently have through that process at very low cost. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful, Bill. That's all for me. Thanks a lot. Operator : And we'll move on to David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question. We appreciated the details that you put on slide 21 around your diversified marketing options. Can you talk more specifically about firm sales, firm transportation, financial hedges and then balance of avoiding those long-term contracts that I know EOG doesn't want? D. Lance Terveen - EOG Resources, Inc.: David, this is Lance Terveen, and thanks for your question. Let me start and answer your last question there, when you talk about commitments. I'll tell you all of us in this room, we've seen the Barnett, the Haynesville, the Uinta. And so when we think about long-term commitments, it's really twofold. It's we want to have near-term flow assurance; and two, we just want to be very disciplined about any kind of long-term commitments. And what we think that does when we can kind of have that first mover and we can identify it, where we need to identify transportation and access to get to markets, at that point, we really make good business decisions, because a lot of folks are going to be waiting for new pipelines that are going to be starting out in late 2019 and probably into 2020. And what happens when there's a lot of hype and especially very active area like the Permian, with 453 rigs running, it's just \u2013 it's not a panic that comes in but people are looking for capacity. So we want to get out in front of that like we've done and like what we've shown. So for us on the commitments, it's really \u2013 it's just being very disciplined, have a balanced approach, get in front of it. And the second thing with that, it allows you to have more discretionary volumes and it allows you to look at other projects, and other things that can come available at even lower rates. So getting in front of that and having some of that near-term assurances really sets us up in the future to lock in other markets or also look at lower transportation costs. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Any specific kind of split D. Lance Terveen - EOG Resources, Inc.: Go ahead, David. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Any specifics of splits as far as you think about that flow assurance of marketing agreements, either firm sales, firm transportation? Because you might have done these contracts or terms two years ago, three years ago, I'm just trying to get an idea of how you think about splitting marketing agreements, pipeline agreements, hedges, just in that kind of forward-looking process (55:07). D. Lance Terveen - EOG Resources, Inc.: Sure, sure. Again, it goes back to our experiences and what we've seen in other basins and as we've looked at making commitments and transportation commitments. So again, when we look at that and we look at the forward forecast and where we think each of the basins might be growing, especially like a new emerging basin. So typically, we want to lock up anywhere from maybe 70% to 80% of that near term and leave kind of more available in the outer years. So really with the crystal ball, when we're looking at making the commitments, we try to protect more of a, call it, the first three years. And then if we need to make medium-term commitments, then those commitment volumes are a little smaller in the outer years. So that's strategically how we think about the commitments, David. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Yeah, so cut a three-year and roll. Okay, that's helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : And we'll move on to Jeffery Campell with Tuohy Brothers. Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good morning. I just wanted to ask for a little bit color on the Woodford oil. I noticed that you've added a rig and you drilled quite a long lateral there, which is usually a sign that you're more into development than into delineation. And it seems like this play has really accelerated in a reasonably short amount of time. So I just wanted to just check in on that. David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Jeff, this is David Trice. On the Woodford, yes, we have picked up additional rigs there. We are running four rigs currently there. And what we're doing this year is, one, we're securing operatorship on all these units, and then also we're doing several spacing tests there. So what we want to really focus on in the Woodford this year is we want to \u2013 like in our other plays, we want to really confirm the correct spacing so that we can be sure to maximize the NPV per section there. Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: And if I could just follow up on what you just said, what's your \u2013 if you look at your position as a whole, what percentage of it can you operate now and what are you trying to get to? David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Really most of the 50,000 acres net that we show we would be able to operate that. We have quite a few trades going on where we may not have a majority interest. And so we think at the end of the day, we'll be able to operate the entire position. Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks for the color. Operator : And next we'll move to Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my question. I'll follow up a bit on the Austin Chalk. If I divide the Austin Chalk into the Karnes Trough into Louisiana and into everything else, where's your sense of how mature your understanding of those plays are right now? And where is the upside on each of those? Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Bob, this is Ezra Yacob. Let me start with the Karnes Trough area down in the South Texas trend. Now like I said, we brought to sale last year a number of wells and we're very happy with the initial rates on there. And again, it's a new concept on the play that we have been working over the last couple of years where we're basically applying our precision targeting, our petro-physical model in combination with our seismic attributes to upscale and model these precision targets that actually have matrix contribution. And then we're applying some of our high density frac designs, things that we've developed in these different basins -or different unconventional plays, basically to the Austin Chalk. And so we're really happy with it. I would say where the upside resides down in South Texas is continuing to delineate targets, high grading those targets and again, kind of the continued evolution of our frac designs. It is the Chalk, so it does \u2013 each of these plays that we're in, whether it's a carbonate, siltstones, mudrocks, as you know, little tweaks on your completion design can make a big difference. And so the biggest upside I see with the Austin Chalk is just that, advances \u2013 continued evolution and advances on our completions, delineating additional targets. And then in Louisiana, it's very early on that prospect. I think everyone knows that we've drilled a very successful Eagles Ranch well out there. We're very pleased with the initial results on there and we'll provide further details on that on future calls. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And elsewhere, is the Austin Chalk trend, should we think of it working along the entire trend or do you need sort of local structures to help you out? Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: This is Ezra again, Bob. Yeah, the way I'd follow up with that is I'd say there are definitely going to be sweet spots. That's obviously a widespread play from Mexico all the way up around Gulf Coast there. Just like any big regional unconventional play, there are going to be sweet spots in different parts of that area. There are different attributes geologically and geophysically, including structure is one of them, that we're looking at to high grade those areas. But any additional color than that, I'm not sure if we want to provide today. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Appreciate it. Operator : And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bill Thomas for any additional or closing remarks. William R.

Here's Bill Thomas. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. EOG is focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through disciplined high-return organic growth. Our Powder River Basin resource additions this quarter demonstrate once again the value of our exploration focus. We were able to grow our premium inventory in both size and quality by adding locations much faster than we drill them. In addition, our second quarter production results demonstrate our ability to consistently execute and deliver strong double-digit oil growth through our decentralized organization and multi-play asset base. EOG's ability to organically generate new prospects coupled with our proven ability to execute on our premium drilling program demonstrates that EOG is a high-return growth machine with the ability to sustainably generate long-term shareholder value. During the second quarter, we exceeded production targets for oil, natural gas, and NGLs, beat our quarterly total per-unit operating cost, realized better than target prices across all three production streams, announced two new shale plays in the Powder River Basin, and added over 1,500 premium locations and 1.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent of net resource potential. In addition, we also identified new premium locations in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford, effectively replacing the inventory we drilled in our two largest core assets. EOG's undrilled net premium resource potential now equals 9.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent and 9,500 net locations, which is more than 13 years of premium return drilling at our current pace. Last but not least, the Board of Directors approved another increase to the common dividend. The current 19% increase coupled with our previous 10% increase last February brings our total dividend increase to 31% this year. This is a tremendous vote of confidence in our premium business strategy, a strong commitment to capital discipline, and demonstrates our commitment to returning cash to shareholders through the dividend. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2018 and beyond, EOG will continue to deploy a disciplined growth strategy. Disciplined growth means pacing long-term growth to allow the company to maximize the value of our acreage, retain efficiencies to support high returns, and generate cash flow to both reinvest and reward shareholders. EOG in particular is uniquely positioned for disciplined growth due to our diverse portfolio of assets. We're not relying on any one basin to drive our company's success, which means we are in a position to grow production without straining the return on our capital investment or the underlying assets. In other words, we can grow each asset at a pace that maximize returns and NPV per acre. Our production growth in 2018 is a result of investing in high-return premium drilling across nine plays in six different basins. Year to date, almost every one of our operational areas grew production and did so while maintaining efficiencies and producing premium returns. With the addition of the Mowry and Niobrara in the Powder River Basin, we now have 11 plays to develop and fuel the company's future. Slide 8 illustrates the progression of our premium inventory, highlighting our ability to consistently replace and grow premium inventory much faster than we drill it. Disciplined reinvestment of cash flow in our deep inventory of high rate of return drilling is fundamental to how EOG creates significant long-term shareholder value. Next up is David Trice to provide details on our exciting Powder River Basin news. David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Bill. Yesterday afternoon we introduced two new premium plays in the Powder River Basin, demonstrating once again the value created by our leadership and exploration. Over the last few years, our Powder River Basin team has focused on understanding the geological complexities of our 400,000 net acre position. Like the Delaware Basin, the Powder River Basin is prolific, with almost a mile deep column of pay and multiple targets. We tested many zones over the years and learned that both the Mowry and the Niobrara shales, much like the Eagle Ford, are resource rich, over-pressured source rocks that produce prolific wells when we apply our refined targeting techniques and EOG-styled completions. Also, much like the Eagle Ford and the Woodford, the Mowry and Niobrara are both shale resource plays, and therefore have great potential for additional efficiencies in the future. Shale allows for tight downspacing, which is a great fit for drilling large packages, using multi-well pads, longer laterals, and zipper fracs. Furthermore, these two resource plays overlap on much of our acreage, allowing development of both concurrently. Tightly spaced wells and co-development also translates to less surface disturbance per well, which reduces our environmental footprint and is particularly important for permitting in Wyoming. Over the last year, we reported some remarkable efficiency records in our Rockies plays, including drilling 18,000 feet in under three days and completing 26 stages in a single 24-hour period. While the records are impressive, so are the averages. Drilling days are down 70% since the start of the downturn in 2014, and completion stages per day are up 50% over the last year. Sustainable cost reductions and shorter cycle times, driven by efficiencies, were a big contributor to adding these two shale plays to our Powder River Basin premium inventory. Currently, well cost in both plays are around $6 million for laterals approaching 2 miles. Combined with average EURs of more than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty, the Mowry and Niobrara shales are delivering premium rates of return at very low finding and development cost. Low finding and development costs drive higher corporate-level returns. We estimate EOG's position in the Mowry Shale is prospective for 1.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent from 875 net premium locations using 660-foot spacing. Oil cuts in the Mowry range from 20% to 60% depending on location. We completed two Mowry wells during the second quarter, and their 30-day initial production averaged almost 2,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our Niobrara Shale resource estimate is 640 million barrels of oil equivalent from 555 net premium locations, also on 660-foot spacing. We expect about half of our estimated Niobrara resource is crude oil. In addition, we identified another 80 net undrilled locations in the Turner play, bringing our undrilled premium location count in the Powder River Basin to over 1,600 net wells. And the Powder River Basin is now ready to become a meaningful contributor to EOG's future growth. We worked hard to assemble and block up our position as well as permit (00:09:59) well locations to capture operatorship. During the second half of 2018, we'll drill the remaining Turner wells planned for the year, and we'll conduct a couple of spacing tests in the Mowry and Niobrara. For 2019, we expect to increase our activity as we add infrastructure and prepare to bring the Powder into full development. Adding nearly 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent in the Powder River Basin from the Mowry, Niobrara, and Turner exemplifies EOG's differentiated investment profile of multiple diverse assets supporting long-term, disciplined, high-return growth. EOG's extensive and diverse asset portfolio is unmatched in the industry and now totals 11 plays across six basins. We have the flexibility to allocate capital to the best performing assets over the long run, ensuring consistent returns to our shareholders throughout the commodity price cycles. Next up is Lance Terveen to discuss our takeaway positioning in the Powder River Basin. D. Lance Terveen - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, David. The existing midstream presence in the Powder River Basin is strong. For liquids-rich natural gas, there are four processors near our operating area with significant low-pressure and high-pressure gathering systems with backup connections as contingencies. This allows EOG to fully utilize existing plant capacity in the area. In conjunction with midstream providers, planned processing, and NGL takeaway expansions, we are designing an EOG gas gathering and compression system. This system is similar to the successful design of our infrastructure in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, and Delaware Basin, and accomplishes three goals : one, control; two, lower operating costs; and, three, access to multiple markets. Now, on the oil side, takeaway in the PRB is plentiful. The Casper and Guernsey hubs provide access to multiple local refining markets as well as the Salt Lake City and Denver markets. Other pipelines are available to access the Cushing market, and we are studying all options, even the potential to move barrels to the Gulf Coast. Wellhead net-backs today for lease sales are also strong, and we currently anticipate the local market dynamics for oil and condensate to remain strong into 2019. Finally, we are working on solutions for longer-term oil gathering and oil terminal infrastructure. We are well positioned for processing and takeaway in the Powder River Basin today, and we are taking steps now to prepare for increased activity longer term. Infrastructure investments we make over the next 18 months will provide the flexibility to respond to changing market dynamics and access a wide variety of markets out of the Powder River Basin. Here's Tim. Timothy K. Driggers - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Lance. As Bill mentioned, the Board of Directors approved a $0.14 increase in the common stock dividend. The indicated annual rate is now $0.88. Combined with a $0.07 increase approved in February, the dividend has increased by 31% in 2018. This should send a strong signal about the effect of our shift to premium has had in lowering our cost structure and improving the profitability of the company as well as our commitment to returning cash to shareholders. At the same time, we are making good progress strengthening EOG's financial position. Since year-end 2017, cash on the balance sheet increased by $174 million to $1 billion, and our net debt-to-capitalization ratio decreased to 24% at June 30. $1.26 billion of debt is now classified as current on the balance sheet, as we intend to repay upon maturity a $350 million bond due in October of this year and a $900 million bond due in June 2019. I'm happy to report both Standard & Poor's and Moody's recognized EOG's growing financial strength. Standard & Poor's updated EOG's credit rating to A-minus, and Moody's changed EOG's outlook to positive. We still expect to generate over $1.5 billion of free cash flow in 2018, assuming $60 oil prices. This is defined as discretionary cash flow less CapEx and dividend payments. The bulk of this free cash flow is anticipated to be generated in the second half of the year. Discretionary cash flow is forecasted to increase through the remainder of the year while our CapEx budget was more heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. Up next to provide details on our operational performance is Billy Helms. Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Tim. I'm happy to report that our operational teams delivered the well results and volume growth projections that we anticipated at the start of the year. In 2018, we are focused on increasing the net present value of our acreage through more efficient, larger development packages. Our 2018 capital plan was designed to increase our well inventory during the first half of the year in order to improve the operational flexibility for managing these larger development packages. As indicated on our last call, we expect to see more production growth in the third quarter following the increase in activity and capital spend that was weighted towards the first half of the year. In addition, our decentralized organization operating in multiple basins gives us the flexibility to adjust our activity to take advantage of changing market conditions. During the second quarter, our Eagle Ford oil production received favorable Gulf Coast prices that were nearly $3 per barrel higher than WTI. Premium Gulf Coast pricing may persist into next year, so we recently added two rigs in the Eagle Ford to build well inventory, providing us optionality as we begin to plan for 2019. I want to emphasize that we still expect to spend within our guided capital expenditure range, although most likely above the midpoint. About 10 more Eagle Ford wells will be completed this year, with most of the additional inventory being carried into 2019. Operating in multiple basins makes this level of flexibility possible and is fundamental to our ability to deliver sustainable, long-term, high-return growth. We remain focused on our goal of reducing well costs and cash operating costs by 5% this year. Our overall unit operating costs are trending down year over year. And while certain lease operating costs are showing signs of upward pressure, we've been able to offset that pressure with other unit cost savings in transportation and DD&A. Total unit costs are still expected to be down at least 10% this year. Looking ahead to 2019, we anticipate the industry will see some inflationary pressures, possibly on the order of 5% to 10%. As we do every year, we are working diligently to find creative solutions to keep our costs flat in the upcoming year. While drilling rigs and tubulars may see upward pressure, we are positioning ourselves to take advantage of pricing softness in other areas. We have good line of sight into our sand and water cost, which we expect to be down in 2019. We currently have about 50% of our 2019 oil field service needs locked in at very competitive prices, and are working to secure more of our service costs ahead of next year. Finally, we'll continue to benefit from efficiency gains and reduced cycle times obtained by optimizing well package size and increasing the use of multi-well pads and zipper fracs. Taken all together, we think we are well positioned to keep costs at least flat in 2019. I'll turn the call over to Ezra Yacob to provide you an update on the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin plays. Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Billy. This quarter we updated our premium inventory for our two largest oil assets, the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin, adding 520 net premium locations, primarily as the result of efficiency gains as well as productivity improvements. We added 145 net premium locations to the Eagle Ford. And in the Delaware Basin, we identified an additional 375 net locations across our four plays. The last major update to premium inventory for these assets was in early 2017. We have since drilled more than 500 net wells between the two basins, 270 in the Eagle Ford and 250 in the Delaware Basin. These two workhorse assets made up 73% of our oil production last year and 58% of our total production. With this update to premium locations, we effectively replaced the inventory we've drilled over the last year and a half. Our Eagle Ford asset delivered another great quarter of consistent high-return results, with 67 net wells brought online. Utilizing larger well packages, longer laterals, and zipper fracs, we continue to incrementally push the boundaries of this world-class play every quarter, and it continues to deliver. Average lateral length on our western acreage is now approaching 2 miles while continuing to deliver excellent initial 30-day production rates. Wells drilled on our western acreage during the second quarter averaged more than 1,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Increased drilling efficiencies are driving down drilling days even as we extend lateral lengths. In fact, this year we are drilling the same total footage per month as we did in 2014 at the peak of our activity level, and doing so with only half the rig count. Furthermore, our drilling team is achieving this performance while staying within a precision drilling window that is approximately one-fifth the size it was four years ago. We've discussed the impact of precision targeting in the past. It is the number one driver of well productivity and critical to optimizing net present value across our 520,000 net acres. In the Austin Chalk, the average lateral length of the five wells drilled during the second quarter was the longest yet at 7,900 feet. Average initial 30-day production exceeded 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Austin Chalk wells on average pay out in just over three months. We continue to examine the Austin Chalk's prospectivity in our South Texas Eagle Ford acreage. The target is less consistent than the Eagle Ford shale. However, where it is prospective, it consistently delivers prolific results. Earlier this year, one of our first successful Austin Chalk wells, the Kilimanjaro, reached 1 million barrels of oil in less than two years, averaging more than 1,500 barrels of oil per day for 626 days. Furthermore, the play is in an advantageous location with well-developed infrastructure close to the Gulf Coast and benefits from our extensive seismic and log control collected through our Eagle Ford development program. In our Delaware Basin asset, we brought 70 net wells to sales in the Leonard, Bone Spring, and Wolfcamp plays. Twenty percent of our Wolfcamp activity during the second quarter was in the Wolfcamp combo trend, a higher GOR play in Reeves County, Texas. Over the last 18 months, we've been building out infrastructure to transition a portion of this asset into a core development area, and we are increasing activity commensurate with that construction. We have captured a 120,000 net acre position across this trend, and the combination of increased operational efficiencies and well performance, permanent infrastructure, and our natural gas processing contracts generate some of the highest net present value per well across the company. This quarter, we brought online 10 net wells averaging over 8,000 feet in lateral length and delivering 2,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well. We're excited to see this trend become a larger contributor to our portfolio, delivering in excess of 200% direct after-tax rate of return. In our Leonard and Bone Spring plays, we completed one of the largest packages we have done to date. The State Viking wells in Loving County are a package of 13 wells drilled across four targets, two in the Leonard and two in the Bone Spring. The combined 30-day rate for this package was a staggering 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, or approximately 1,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well on laterals averaging about 4,500 feet. In every one of our unconventional plays, determining optimal well spacing is critical to maximizing the net present value of each acre. Determining optimal well spacing is also a problem-solving exercise that requires balancing multiple variables. Drilling widely spaced wells to maximize initial production rates and early returns can prevent optimal asset development over the long run due to the parent-child effect. However, overly aggressive well spacing will also have a detrimental effect due to potential communication between wells and potential overinvestment. In each of our plays, we collect an extensive amount of robust drilling, completion, and production data and integrate it with geologic analysis to build reservoir models. These complex models provide the basis to determine optimal development patterns to maximize the NPV of our acreage. A basin as target-rich as the Delaware is a great example. During the first half of 2018, we drilled a number of spacing and development patterns across six different Upper Wolfcamp targets in different combinations across the play. One of these packages was the Quanta Parker 8H through 11H, a four-well package drilled on our Texas acreage. Average 30-day IPs for the wells in this package were more than 2,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well on lateral lengths approaching 2 miles. The wells in this package were drilled 440 feet apart across two Upper Wolfcamp targets. This is some of the tightest spacing we've tested in the Wolfcamp to date, and these wells are generating at an outstanding NPV of $10 million per well. The Delaware Basin is still early in its development. Leveraging our experience and data from 15 years of developing unconventional resources across North America is a tremendous advantage in our efforts to maximize NPV across our 416,000-acre position. Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Ezra. I would like to leave everyone with a few closing thoughts. Number one, EOG continues to solidly execute our 2018 premium drilling program. The company is delivering strong triple-digit direct well returns and strong double-digit U.S. oil growth. Number two, EOG's exploration effort continues to deliver by organically generating premium drilling potential much faster than we drill it. This quarter's addition of 1.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent in the Powder River Basin is a remarkable and significant resource addition to our portfolio. Since permanently shifting to premium in 2016, we've essentially tripled our premium location count and more than quadrupled our premium resource potential. Number three, EOG now has 11 premium options to efficiently deploy capital. Our multi-play options enhance our ability to deliver strong returns and growth consistently and sustainably over the long haul. Number four, we're committed to a disciplined growth strategy. For the remainder of the year and as we look to start planning for 2019, you should expect EOG to remain disciplined about growth and capital allocation to maximize returns. And number five, executing our premium strategy will grow production and cash flow, produce double-digit ROCE, and fund dividend growth. More importantly, we can consistently deliver this performance over the long term and through commodity price cycles. We believe that is unique, not just in the E&P industry but in any industry, and it is perfectly aligned with our ultimate goal to create significant shareholder value. Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A. Operator : Your first question today will be from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Bill, I'm not sure who you want to direct this one to. But some time ago, I seem to recall you mentioning the Powder River had some of the best wells in the portfolio. Now that you have shown us what this can do by way of the additional inventory, how would you characterize how activity might evolve there relative to the other plays or indeed additive to the other plays in 2019? David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, Doug, this is David Trice. As far as the Mowry and the Niobrara go, we'll be increasing activity in 2019 on those plays. The volume impact of those will be more likely weighted to late 2019 and on into 2020 as we build out our infrastructure there. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So I guess we'll wait in the cuff. I guess there are no specifics you can give us at this time, but I'm presuming it's not going to be a two-rig programs out there. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Well, as far as any specifics, we'll give the specifics in February when we give our 2019 plan. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, thank you. I thought I would try anyway. But my follow-up is, Bill, I feel as if I ask you this question a lot nowadays, but the cadence of spending in the second half of the year, given even slightly above the midpoint of your guidance, suggests that we're dropping off quite a bit to a $1.25 billion-type run rate. Is that realistic? And how are you starting to think about, dare I say it, share buybacks? Are they ever going to be on the table assuming you remain capital disciplined and let's say a $60-type of level? I'm just thinking about the amount of free cash you're generating this year. Despite the guidance on the debt reduction, it still looks like you're going to be churning out a great deal of free cash beyond your uses. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Doug, we constantly evaluate all of our options, and we are very, very committed to doing what's right for the long-term shareholders. As you know, we manage the company for a sustainable success over the long term. So currently with the improving commodity prices, we believe certainly that the first thing we want to do is continue to reinvest in our premium drilling at very, very high rates of return, and continue to invest in organic exploration that's produced these Powder River Basin results. And we're focused on debt reduction, and we're certainly focused on, and very committed to the shareholders with a very strong dividend increase. And so at this point in the life of the company, that is certainly the best way we feel like to continue to create long-term shareholder value and leave our options open and leave us flexible to do what is right for the shareholders in the long term. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So the first part of that question, Bill, sorry to push on this, but the drop-off in spending in the second half of the year, is that run rate about right? And can you maybe just give us an idea what's driving the drop sequentially? And I'll leave it there. Thank you. Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Doug, this is Billy Helms. So the plan that we put together at the start of the year is consistent with the way it's being executed today. We planned about and actually completed about 40% of the wells. In the company that were completed in the first half were Delaware Basin wells. That will decline in the second half of the year to about 30% of our overall completions. And on the flip side, our plays up in the Rockies that we've talked about, the DJ, the Bakken, and the Powder River Basin, will go from about 10% of our completions in the first half to about 20% of our completions in the second half. And so we're bringing in a mixture of just lower-cost wells in the second half of the year as compared to the first half of the year, which is why the spending rate has declined a little bit. The goal in the first part of the year was to build, as we moved to these larger packages wells, was to build up our inventory, and that gives us a lot of flexibility in managing these programs. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That's really helpful, guys. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question will be from Paul Sankey of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Hi, good morning, everyone. Gentlemen, I understand your excitement over the operational performance in the Powder River Basin, but it seems to me, especially with the stock trading off this morning, that the inventory is getting bewilderingly large, and you repeated on the call that you're adding inventory faster than you drill it. You're up to 13 years of future drilling. Is there a terminal point for that at which you don't need any more, or perhaps would you shift to an ultra-premium well location metric with a higher hurdle so that it becomes more meaningful at a given level? Thank you. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Paul, I think you know our focus is certainly replacing and adding to our premium inventory, but it's also very focused on improving the quality of the premium inventory. If you look at the slide, I believe it's slide number 8, you'll see that our inventory is growing very fastly. But at the bottom, it shows the per-well productivity and reserve potentials per well. And you can see that that's also going up too. So that went up again as we added the Powder River. And what that does, with multiple assets, that gives us the ability to continue to shift our capital based on returns. And that is what we're focused on, is maximizing and continuing to improve the returns in the company. And so that gives us more options and even better quality inventory to continue to do that. And it also gives us an option down the road that if we're not going to drill that in a certain amount of time, we can certainly get value for that by maybe monetizing it or doing other things with it too. So generating more and better inventory is not a problem. That is a very good thing to do, and that's what we're focused on, and that's what's going to continue to create value for the company going forward. Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : So I guess what you're saying is that the per-well metric that you highlighted is effectively an increase to the definition, an ongoing increase to the definition of a premium well? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yes, they're getting better as we continue to generate over time. Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Right, I've got you. And then the CapEx for this year was set at a lower price, I assume. I forget the exact number, but it's being maintained despite higher prices. It's really a follow-up to Doug's question. Can we run this level of CapEx into the future because that becomes such an important way of looking at all this? Thanks. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: We don't have any specific guidance for 2019 or forward. The message we \u2013 and the way we're going to manage the company is we're going to stay disciplined, and we're going to stay focused on returns and not growth. So we'll spend and increase our CapEx only with discipline. Obviously, our cash flow is growing even if oil prices stay the same because our volume is going up. But we're not going to go so fast that we begin to have rising costs or we exceed the learning curve. And we're focused on developing each one of our properties at the maximum NPV and returns, and that takes discipline and it takes time. And so we're going to focus and stay very disciplined going forward. Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : I met my quota. Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Leo Mariani of NatAlliance Securities. Please go ahead. Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities : Hey, guys. I was hoping to dive a little bit more into the Powder River here. Just noticing that you haven't had a ton of wells in the Niobrara and Mowry, but you guys are certainly coming out with a pretty robust inventory. I was hoping you can maybe just give us a little bit more color if there are a lot of industry wells that are giving you confidence. And then also I'm just trying to get a sense of how the new Powder River plays rank in comparison to some of your other premium plays. David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Leo, this is David Trice. So we've known for quite some time that the Mowry and the Niobrara have a lot of resource potential under our acreage. We began drilling on those actually in 2008 and 2009 as far as in the testing phase. So over the years, we've collected a lot of data. We've drilled nine Niobrara wells and nine Mowry wells since that time. We have five proprietary cores in the Mowry and two proprietary cores in the Niobrara in addition to all the publicly available data. So what this has allowed us to do is build over 1,700 full petro-physical models across the Powder River Basin. And what that really does is allows us to define the very best targets, also the resource in place, and helps with our completions as well, which is really critical to the success of the plays. And then as you noted, there has been industry activity in the basin. There have been over 200 Niobrara wells drilled in the Powder River Basin and about 30 Mowry wells. So we can take all that data with all the petro-physical data and core data, and we can build some very sophisticated reservoir models that we can really apply across a lot of our different plays and help us to understand both these plays. So all of that data that's been collected over the years has really helped. And then one of the biggest factors in converting this to premium is the fact that our cost structure has dramatically come down over the last several years. We've been able to focus our drilling the last few years on the Turner, which is a higher permeability sandstone that's premium. And so as we've done that, we've gotten a lot better at executing in the Powder River Basin, and we've been able to bring down a lot of our drilling and completions, facility, and LOE costs over time. So as we mentioned on some of the calls and even on this call, we set a lot of records over several years in the Powder. We routinely drill these Turner wells. These are 2-mile wells, in six to seven days, and our zipper frac operations allow us to complete up to 10 stages a day. So all of that really, really helps, and it really helps deliver a really low finding cost. As you think about the low finding cost, that ends up flowing through to your corporate-level return, so that's going to drive a higher ROCE over time. So really we do have quite a bit of data, and we've got a lot of experience in the basin. Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities : Okay, that's helpful. I just wanted to shift gears a little bit over to the Delaware Basin. I just wanted to get you guys to talk a little bit high level about what your exposure is to some of the weaker differentials there, and if you guys are able to maybe get a bunch of those barrels over to the Gulf Coast. And I guess if there is some exposure to the diffs, would you plan to reallocate capital going forward? D. Lance Terveen - EOG Resources, Inc.: Leo, hey. This is Lance. Hey, thanks for the question. I think you can really see the value of our transportation is really flowing through. When you look at our gas differentials, you can absolutely see for the first quarter and the second quarter relatively very little exposure related to Waha on gas. And then for the oil differentials, I think what you're seeing there too, we've talked about 25% is subject to the Mid-Cush. But when you look at our transportation that we have, and then when you look at that with our natural hedges that we have operationally and the large focus that we have in the Rockies, big Gulf Coast exposure, it's really distilled, it's really diluted down. So when you really look at the Mid-Cush exposure even for the rest of this year, it's less than 10%. Then you add in our Mid-Cush hedges, we're very well insulated in terms of the differential related to the Permian. But maybe just to talk about the transportation, we've done an exceptional job there. We've got our Conan terminal. That's up and running full speed. We're going to have five market connections there long term. We're moving barrels to Cushing today. We've got capacity down to Corpus today. We don't talk a lot about it, but when you think about a lot of the new pipeline expansions that are going to be starting up, starting in late 2019 and then 2020, EOG was a big reason why a lot of those got anchored. When you think about the Sunrise expansion that's going to be starting very quickly going into Cushing, that's EOG. When you think about Gray Oak Pipeline starting up, we're going to have a position behind that with our terminal. So we think not only 2018 for the rest of this year and then also into 2019 and beyond, especially looking into late 2019 moving into 2020, we're effectively going to have very minimal if any Mid-Cush exposure. And that's the value of having a lot of optionality, because what we've seen in other basins, as you see the infrastructure get built out and somewhat overbuilt, you don't want to have too much exposure into one market. Because as we see things going into 2020, the overbuild situation, you could actually see a lot of strength actually in the Midland local market. So long term we're going to have the flexibility to sell into all those markets. Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities : Okay, that's a great answer. Thanks. Operator : The next question will be from Bob Brackett of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning. Talking a bit about the Powder River Basin, if I think about the way you've talked about those locations, it feels like there's a single landing zone in each of the Mowry and the Niobrara. We know that the Mowry and the Niobrara are regionally extensive, but your acreage footprint is a subset of your total acreage, and you haven't even talked about more than half the targets out in the column there. How should we think about how well refined the numbers are for locations, and what's the potential they could grow? David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Bob, this is David Trice again. On the Niobrara and the Mowry, those do overlap. And so as you think about those, what we've given you there is a subset of our acreage, and it's only the portion that we feel is premium. So all the locations are premium. If you think about how they overlap, pretty much 100% of our Niobrara will be co-developed with the Mowry. So where the Nio is premium, the Mowry is also premium. And then the Mowry footprint is a little bit larger than the Niobrara footprint. And so if you think about that, about 60% to 65% of that area will be co-developed with the Niobrara. So we haven't really talked a lot about the other zones or anything like that. But that's always something we're working on. We're always testing new zones, trying to find better targets. And currently in both the Niobrara and the Mowry, we're focused predominantly on single zones, but we're also looking at potential to stack or stagger in either of those. So that's an ongoing process as we collect more data and get more tests in the ground. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great, I appreciate it. Operator : The next question will be from Irene Haas of Imperial Capital. Please go ahead. Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC : If I may, to touch a little bit on South Texas on your Austin Chalk, right now you've got 582,000 net acres in the area. I was just wondering of what percentage is prospective for Chalk, and then in terms of the product mix, oil, gas, and NGL. And can you cherry-pick and move into the more oily and liquids-rich windows? Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Irene, this is Ezra Yacob. And as I mentioned in the opening remarks, this quarter we brought on five wells there in the Austin Chalk in South Texas at an average lateral length of about 8,000 feet and over 3,000 barrels of equivalents per day. The oil mix on those was about 87%. And we continue to be very pleased, very happy with our Austin Chalk performance down in the South Texas acreage. Part of what makes it so prospective down there is that we've collected an awful lot of data while we've been developing and producing the Eagle Ford underneath the Austin Chalk. And so integrating that core data, the log data that we've collected along with our seismic, we've really been able to map out and high-grade where we've been developing the Austin Chalk. As we've talked about in the past, it's geologically a bit of a complex play. Historically, the industry's success has been pretty inconsistent from well to well as it was more of a fracture play. We've really been focused on the matrix contribution in the Austin Chalk, making it a bit more repeatable. But outside of that, across our acreage and different GORs, I'm not sure if we're prepared to get into those details today. Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC : May I follow up also? With your enhanced oil recovery, it looks like you guys have added some locations this year, maybe a little color on what we should be looking forward to 2019. Is it going to be a consistent program that would be replicated each year? That's all. Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Irene, again, we've been very pleased with our EOR performance in South Texas. As you know, that's a process that we really implement after the units or the drilling area is fully developed. And so there is a quicker ramp up over the first few years, and then there will be a little bit of a slowdown as we convert wells because we need to make sure that we're optimally developing for primary recovery. The production profile so far is falling right in line with our early models. We're expecting to produce an incremental 30% to 70% more than the primary recovery. And this year we're on target to turn over approximately 90 wells onto the EOR process. And as far as the forecast out in 2019, I don't think we're prepared to give guidance on that at this time. Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Christine Alfonso of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, it's Brian Singer actually. Thanks, good morning. I wanted to stick in the Eagle Ford for the first question here. You added 145 new premium locations, but still have substantial locations not classified as premium. Could you talk to the level of certainty that those non-premium locations could or will not become premium? And can you address your latest thoughts on well spacing in the Eagle Ford? Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Brian, this is Ezra again. Hopefully, I'll hit on all those points here. In the Eagle Ford, so the first thing I'd mention is that inventory update for the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin, that's a snapshot in time. We continue, between lowering well costs through operational efficiencies and increasing well productivity, continue to see and feel good about our ability to convert non-premium wells into the premium status. To date, we've got 7,200 total wells in our provided guidance on the Eagle Ford, and those are actual sticks on a map, with 2,300 of those approximately as premium, about 2,600 of those as drilled wells. And so that leaves roughly about 2,000 wells that are currently non-premium. And with the advancements we've made just in the last few years on the operational efficiencies, I think we feel very good about being able to convert a large portion of those. I mentioned in the opening remarks, we're averaging 10,000-foot laterals drilled out in the western Eagle Ford, and we brought on 22 wells this quarter at that treated lateral length. And those wells were actually drilled in less than seven days' time, again, in that precision target of just a 20-foot window. And so that combined with our geologic understanding and our completions methodology should really keep that stimulation near wellbore and complex. I feel very good about increasing well productivity also. And then the second part of the question was on the spacing side. That's right. We're developing currently between 330 to 500-foot spacing across the Eagle Ford. A lot of that is dependent on the different geologic trends that we're in, whether we're in the east or the west, whether or not there's more or less faulting in the area. Again, we strive not to get into a one-size-fits-all manufacturing mode. That's exactly what we don't want to do. We try to integrate as much data as we collect, and we remain flexible to adjust our drilling patterns and our targeting based on the local geology across the asset base. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. And my follow-up also is on the topic of spacing but shifting to the Delaware and the Wolfcamp. You've highlighted over multiple quarters the expectations that the industry could struggle a bit here on parent-child issues and spacing tests. And here you're highlighting favorable results from your 440-foot spacing test in the Wolfcamp. Can you talk more about the implications of that, if any, across your acreage, how much acreage could be developed potentially at that spacing? And can you remind us what's built into your premium locations and what milestone set you're looking for further? Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Brian, this is Ezra again. Let me start with your last question there. Our type curve for the Wolfcamp oil window is \u2013 and that's across 226,000 acres in the oil window \u2013 that's a 1.3 million barrel of equivalent gross type curve on a 7,000-foot lateral at 660-foot spacing. And that type curve of course is an average across the 220,000 acres. And so what we've highlighted over the last couple of quarters are we've been trying to optimize our spacing, really with a focus on maximizing the NPV for our acreage position. We've been happy year to date with our progress there. All of our Wolfcamp wells are performing at or above the type curve that we've released. So we're very, very pleased with that. Really what happens across the play, I think the way to think about it is, especially in the Delaware Basin, the geology is pretty complex. There's just an abundance of targets. And so again, similar to how I referenced the Eagle Ford, the last thing we want to do is get going too fast and get into a manufacturing mode. I think the 440-foot spacing highlighted on the Quanah Parkers highlights a good spacing for that area and that geology where those targets are applicable. I think with as many targets as there is in the Delaware Basin and in the Wolfcamp, we think there's a tremendous amount of upside, but we're happy with what we've released right now. And as we gather more data and have more details for you, we'll certainly update you. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Michael Scialla of Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Lance, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about the midstream in the Powder River. It sounds like you're going to build out your own gathering system and there's plenty of processing capacity, but I was wondering. It looks like there's going to be a lot of gas coming out of the play. What are your thoughts about the end markets for that gas? Where is most of that going to go? D. Lance Terveen - EOG Resources, Inc.: Great question, Michael. One thing to remember too, we've been operating down here for a long time, so we actually have existing capacity on the intra-state systems there today. And as you think about a lot of that residue gas, it makes its way down to Cheyenne. And then from Cheyenne, we have other transportation arrangements that we can move further downstream from there too. So again, as we've look back over time, when we look at making commitments, we're going to be really very disciplined about it. We're looking at all the macro things, what's going on up in Wyoming. We're looking at all the takeaway on the pipes. And then we also want to be very careful just from a transportation standpoint. We don't want to make transportation commitments at some different rates. As we know, things are going to change. Basis is going to change over time. So I'd say to get you comfortable there, we're aware and familiar of all the markets. We've been operating and marketing in that area for a long time. And then as we look at layering in additional capacity over time, we're going to be very disciplined on that and ensure that it matches up. And like we've said in the past, we typically like to have anywhere from 70% to 80% of coverage for the first three to five years because your crystal ball so far looking out and what's happening out in the macro environment and with pricing. And so that's traditionally how we like to set things up from a capacity standpoint looking forward. Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good, thanks for that. And I was just wondering, any update on the Anadarko-Woodford? You guys had talked about it the prior quarter, but not much this quarter. I'm just wondering where that stands. David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Michael, this is David Trice. So on the Woodford, we were reasonably active there in the second quarter. We brought on a number of wells late in the quarter, including two four-well packages of wells that are going to be spacing tests. And so as you know, what we really like about that play is the high oil cut and the low decline nature of the play. So really coming out with 24-hour IPs are really not that beneficial. So what we're really looking to do is provide a little more color in the next quarter on those larger packages. Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good, thank you. Operator : The next question will be from David Heikkinen of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Good morning, guys, a couple in the weeds questions. You commented that you had two Wolfcamp targets in the 440-foot testing. What was the hypotenuse between those? I know you gave the lateral at 440. Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: David, this is Ezra. You caught me off-guard with the hypotenuse. I will say in the vertical sense, the spacing between those two targets is approximately 120 feet. And so 120x440, you can do the math. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Yes. And then your operating expense guidance was up due to the higher workover expenses, and you expect that to trend down as your larger pads get normalized. One question, for the offset wells post-workover, did they come back to the prior production levels before they were frac-impacted? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: David, this is Billy Helms. What we've experienced in our plays is we are successful in getting those wells pretty much back to what they were producing prior to the frac hits. I think one thing we've noticed in some of the plays is production from the offsets can increase. But in general, they do tend to come back to what they were producing prior to the cleanouts. And sometimes, it just takes a little longer in certain plays to react. We've learned a lot about how to manage those larger packages of wells and the lumpy nature of the production that we see as a result of those and then how to best manage the offset production and clean out the wellbores. So that's why it gives us confidence that our expense workover costs are going to trend down through the rest of the year. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : How much downtime did you have, like how many barrels was that? I was just curious, in the second quarter. Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: It varies certainly by play and also it varies a lot between \u2013 so it's hard to give you a specific answer. But in each play, the amount of depletion that you have from that offset production prior to coming in with the new package affects it. The well spacing, the targeting, and how big the fracs are that you're putting on the new wells, all those play a role in how much the production is down. So it's hard to give you a specific number really based on that. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : All right. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question will be from Robert Morris of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great, thanks. I think you've hit on almost all my questions. But I just guess following up, Ezra, you mentioned that the type curve is 1.3 million barrels gross for a 7,000-foot lateral on 660-acre spacing on the Wolfcamp A. As you go down to 440-foot spacing, I know slide 14 gives it on a 5,000-foot lateral basis, but what would you anticipate the degradation in the per-well EOR as you go to that tighter spacing? Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Robert, this is Ezra. So it's a little bit difficult to quantify. That 1.3 million barrels is an average across our 220,000 acres. Right now, the Quanah Parkers are outperforming that type curve on the 440. I don't want to mislead you and suggest that we're thinking 440-foot spacing is the correct spacing going forward across the entire 226,000 net acre position. Like I said, that's exactly the route that we prefer not to go down to is to get into a manufacturing mode. We really integrate our completions data, our reservoir data, and our geology most importantly to right-size each of these well packages for the area that we're drilling in. This is the approach that we have taken really in each of our plays that we've been developing throughout the 15 years we've been developing unconventional horizontal plays. And so hopefully that gives you a little bit of color on the 440 there on the Quanah Parkers. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I appreciate it. I understand. It's a lot of data, and it's very complicated. So I appreciate that. Thanks. Operator : And, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Thomas for his closing remarks. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: In closing, we want to thank each EOG employee for their contribution to another excellent quarter. 2018 is turning out to be a banner year for the company. We're achieving record returns on investment and record oil production while adding new premium drilling potential much faster than we drill it. EOG has a sustainable high-return business model and positioned to deliver long-term shareholder value. Thank you for listening and thank you for your support. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines.",

Here's Bill Thomas. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Tim, and good morning to everyone. EOG is a high-return organic growth company and we are delivering what we promised : a compelling combination of high returns, disciplined growth and free cash flow. In the third quarter, we lowered well costs and improved well performance. As a result, year-to-date, we are generating triple-digit well level returns. We grew our oil production 27% year-over-year and total production 25%. And we generated over $0.5 billion in free cash flow. This is a rare performance not often seen in our industry or even in the broader market. Our third quarter results demonstrate the value of EOG's unique culture of innovation, supported by a rich history of a data-driven, non-bureaucratic flat organization. Innovations, real-time data gathering, rapid analytics and redeployment of learnings to the field are continually producing improving results through the company. For example, in the Delaware Basin, we are making significant progress in breaking the code for optimum well spacing. Likewise, on the cost side, we are making significant progress driving down drilling and completion costs. The same is true for our Woodford Oil Play, where just like in the Delaware, we're finding better drilling targets, discovering improved completion techniques and lowering costs all at the same time. We're excited about our progress and the continuous improvements we are seeing this year. And more importantly, we believe there's plenty of momentum to continue to get better in 2019. EOG's unique culture of innovation and focus on exploration are fundamental to our sustainable business model. Our culture of innovation drives continuous improvements in each play we develop, maximizing the value of our leasehold by optimizing NPV, returns and finding and development costs. Our focus on organic exploration makes EOG a prospect-generating machine, and we continue to generate significant new ideas. And to be clear about it, we're only interested in adding new plays that will increase the quality of our premium inventory, and we're encouraged with the new prospects we're currently evaluating. Innovation and exploration are key to EOG's sustainable business model and creates long-term value for our shareholders. We're on track to deliver double-digit ROC and strong double-digit production growth in 2018. Those two milestone achievements, combined with returning cash to shareholders through a 31% increase in the dividend this year, debt reduction and the generation of substantial free cash flow make EOG a unique and compelling investment, not only in the E&P industry, but in the broader market. Looking forward to 2019, we're not going to increase capital at the expense of efficiencies and returns. We will develop our assets and spend capital at a pace that will optimize our learning curve and allow sustainable improvement to our well productivity and cost structure. Any production growth is strictly the result of disciplined capital allocation to high return assets. Furthermore, capital allocation will continue to be based on returns measured against our premium price deck of $40 flat oil and $2.50 flat natural gas prices, no matter if commodity prices improve next year. Our goal of being one of the lowest cost producers in the global oil market has not changed. We are continuously resetting the company to deliver strong returns, even in a low to moderate oil price environment. Next up is Billy to discuss third quarter highlights that are the results of a well-executed capital and operational plan and how we plan to maintain that performance for the remainder of the year and into 2019. Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Bill. Our operating teams continue to deliver solid performance executing on our 2018 program. As a result, we are seeing returns on a direct basis reach levels previously not achieved in the history of the company. New technology is increasing drilling speeds, drilling more consistent targets and lowering cost, all at the same time. Combined with cost reductions from local sand, water recycling and infrastructure projects, we are well on our way to achieving our stretch goal of reducing average cost 5% by year-end 2018. Our goal is to be one of the lowest cost producers in the global E&P industry, and we are very pleased with our progress through the third quarter. As we near the end of 2018, industry activity is slowing. Consequently, the service sector is experiencing a period of softness in the market. To take advantage of market conditions, we elected to secure some of our existing service providers through the fourth quarter for next year's program. This will capture favorable prices and sustain the operational continuity of these high-performing service providers into 2019. For example, we retained a number of high-performing completion crews that we had initially planned to release in the fourth quarter. Retaining these crews means we will complete 20 additional net wells compared to our prior forecast and accomplish our objective of maintaining our momentum into next year. We have contracted for about 65% of our anticipated services and materials needs in 2019, which is higher at this point in the calendar year than in past years. By doing so, we expect to reduce total well cost again in 2019. The negotiated structure for these services provides EOG with a great deal of flexibility to adjust our activity level in 2019. We also anticipate opportunities to capture additional leasehold before year-end. As Bill mentioned, our exploration efforts are key to our proven sustainable business model by both replenishing and improving the quality of our premium inventory. As we begin planning for 2019, disciplined capital allocation is key. We view growth as a by-product of focusing on returns first. While we aren't providing specific guidance for 2019 today, we can provide some broad outlines of how the plan is shaping up. We aren't targeting an arbitrary growth rate. We are seeking to reinvest capital to the point that allows us to continue to lower cost and improve efficiencies. Again, capital allocation will continue to be based on returns measured against our premium price deck of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. I'll turn the call over to Ezra to update you on the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford. Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Billy. In the Delaware Basin, we've made remarkable progress determining how to optimally develop this technically-complex basin. During the first three quarters of 2018, we put 201 net wells to sales in various spacing and target patterns, which generated more than 150% direct after-tax rate of return. Well results across all of our Delaware Basin targets are consistently outperforming their respective type curves and early production observations and data have been incorporated into our ongoing development to further improve future well productivity. The geology in this basin is variable and complex, so there will not be a single answer on spacing or package size; however, the ultimate goal is to maximize capital efficiency by optimizing the numerous drivers of finding cost, returns and NPV. We're also making significant progress reducing well costs in a number of areas. Like many operators, we are benefiting from local sand. But most of our gains are from operational efficiencies. Drilling days are down 10%. We've steadily increased the use of zipper fracs throughout the year, contributing to a 20% increase in stages completed per day and a more than 10% decrease in completions costs. Finally, our investment in water infrastructure is paying off. We are moving 95% of our water on pipe. That includes water used for drilling and completion operations, as well as produced water. Our progress in the Delaware Basin is a prime example of EOG's culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. We continue to experiment with operational and logistics changes and targeting and completions advances, all supported by real-time data capture to quickly respond to changing conditions at the field level. The result is better wells at lower costs. The Eagle Ford continues to deliver consistent performance quarter after quarter. We've been drilling this world-class asset for almost 10 years and we are still growing production, innovating our operations and experimenting with well completions, targeting and spacing. The well mix in the Eagle Ford during the third quarter included a higher proportion of western acreage wells. While the pay is thinner in the west, there's less faulting, which allows for longer laterals. The longer laterals you can drill, the better the efficiencies to be gained during drilling and completions. Wells drilled in the west this year are averaging over 3,500 feet per day and are delivering the highest direct NPV of our Eagle Ford program. These long lateral Western Eagle Ford wells will make up a growing proportion of our total Eagle Ford development in the future. Across our 520,000 net-acre position in the Eagle Ford Oil Window, we have a massive inventory of 2,300 net undrilled premium locations. We continue to make progress maximizing value through technical innovation and operational efficiency, which in turn generates additional premium wells. The Eagle Ford remains core to EOG's business and one of the most important assets driving our production growth. Here's David Trice. David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Ezra. We are in the initial innings of our Woodford Oil Window play in the Anadarko Basin and are experimenting with completion designs, testing various targets, confirming well spacing and lowering cost. Late in the second quarter, we brought online a four-well, 660-foot-space package that targeted the same landing zone. The four Ted wells have over 120 days of production and are matching or exceeding our 1 million barrel oil equivalent per well type curve for the play. The Ted's average per well 30-day initial production delivered 660 barrels of oil per day and their 90-day IP held up at 530 barrels per day. These results are consistent with the performance we have seen since we started actively developing the Woodford last year. Initial IPs in this play tend to be lower than those in our other plays; however, they also have a lower decline rate. The performance of this four-well package supports our initial estimate that 660-foot spacing is optimal in the Woodford and delivers premium economics at low finding and development costs. Going forward, we will be working to optimize spacing, while targeting multiple landing zones. On the cost side, we're making great progress toward our target well cost of $7.8 million per well. Recent wells have come in at or even below our targeted cost and we anticipate that costs in 2019 could average below $7.8 million. One significant source of future cost reduction is the water reuse program that is being rolled out in our Oklahoma operations. We expect at least 50% of our water needs in 2019 will be sourced through recycling, and that percentage will increase over time. We're currently moving up the learning curve in the Woodford. In typical EOG fashion, we're innovating and experimenting with completion and targeting technology, capturing data in real-time, then rapidly redeploying what we've learned in the field. As a result, we expect to continue to improve the Woodford play's well productivity and cost structure as it grows to contribute meaningfully to EOG's production and premium returns. We mentioned on our year-end call that starting this year we decided to take a more seasonal approach to developing the Bakken. Historically, activity in the winter has come at a higher cost due to harsher conditions, so we decided to make it a practice to minimize activity through the winter months. As a result, most of our 2018 Bakken program started production in the second and third quarter. During the third quarter, we completed 12 net wells with an average 30-day IP of almost 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well. These wells are solidly premium due to high oil cuts, low decline rates and very low well costs. The wells brought online in the third quarter cost approximately $5 million for laterals that averaged about 9,400 feet. The cost structure in the Bakken is one of the primary reasons we consistently deliver premium economics that are sustainable through commodity price cycles. The Bakken remains an important asset in EOG's diverse portfolio of plays, providing flexibility for reinvestment at our premium return hurdle rate. Our Powder River Basin activity during the third quarter was focused on the Turner play where we completed 11 net wells that produced an average of 1,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well in the first 30 days. In the Mowry we drilled two wells that we are currently completing and expect to spud a Niobrara well in the fourth quarter. From a technical standpoint, we continue to fine-tune target identification and execution in both plays, as well as dialing in the right completion practices. In the early life of any new play, this tends to be an iterative process as we collect data and rapidly integrate the new information on a go-forward basis. We are also in initial planning stages for two spacing tests that will target the Mowry and Niobrara. We are planning to spud the tests by year-end, and the results will help determine how we co-develop the Mowry and Niobrara going forward. Co-development of these targets will drive additional long-term efficiencies, lower cost and increase returns in the Powder River Basin. As we plan for 2019, we are in active discussions with third-party service providers to ensure we have capacity to transport and process production next year and beyond. In addition, we will begin to add EOG-owned infrastructure at a pace that is commensurate with development. This pay-as-you-go strategy will ensure that we can maintain our capital efficiency, even as we increase activity in the basin. EOG-owned infrastructure will potentially include oil, gas and water gathering facilities, water recycling facilities, oil terminals and compressor stations. The main advantage to EOG-owned infrastructure is that it dramatically lowers lease operating and transportation expenses, as well as future capital cost associated with water handling. It also gives us greater control and flexibility, along with access to multiple markets, which will ultimately result in higher netback prices. In summary, we're planning for long-term, high-return growth out of the Powder River Basin, the newest addition to our portfolio of premium assets. Here's Tim. Timothy K. Driggers - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, David. EOG's financial position improved significantly during the third quarter. The company generated discretionary cash flow of $2.3 billion. EOG invested $1.7 billion in exploration and development expenditures and paid $107 million in dividends. Free cash flow was $503 million. Cash on the balance sheet at September 30 was $1.3 billion, and total debt was $6.4 billion, for a net debt to total capitalization ratio of 22%. This same ratio was 28% just a year ago. Our goal is to repay $3 billion of debt through 2021. The first repayment was for a $350 million bond that came to maturity October 1, 2018. We also reached an agreement to divest of our UK operations, including the Conway asset and expect to close before year-end. With the recent volatility in commodity prices, projections of future cash flow move around considerably, even on a daily basis. But EOG's priorities are steadfast : invest with discipline, focus on rate of return and maintain a strong financial position. Our goal, as always, is to create significant shareholder value over the long-term. I'll now turn it back over to Bill for closing remarks. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Thanks, Tim. I would like to share the following concluding remarks. First, we are making significant progress on optimizing well spacing in the Delaware Basin and other plays. We're breaking the code on how to increase well productivity and lower finding and development costs while optimizing NPV. We feel next year our capital efficiency will be much-improved. Second, we're on track to reduce well costs 5% by year-end 2018, and we believe we can continue to reduce costs further in 2019. Third, as we demonstrated last quarter with the addition of the Powder River, Niobrara and Mowry plays, the company continues to organically add significant new high return premium drilling inventory much faster than we're drilling it. More importantly, EOG's inventory is growing in quality, not just quantity. Better rocks make better wells and enhance the company's ability to deliver high returns in the future. And we are encouraged with the new ideas we're generating through our exploration efforts. Fourth, EOG's unique innovative culture, real-time data gathering, advanced analytics and quick deployment of new ideas to the field are delivering sustainable cost and productivity improvements across the company. The combination of our pleased but not satisfied culture and industry-leading information technology is delivering sustainable results and provides a significant competitive advantage for the company. Fifth. We're systematically resetting the company's performance to be one of the lowest cost producers in the global oil market. Step by step we believe we're continuously improving the company to produce strong returns through the commodity price cycles. And finally, our third quarter results demonstrates EOG's ability to deliver strong double-digit return on capital employed, strong double-digit production growth and generate free cash flow. This combination is rare in the energy sector and places EOG in line with the top performers in any sector of the market. It's a unique and compelling combination that creates significant long-term shareholder value. Thanks for listening and now we'll go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. Our first question today will come from Ryan Todd of Simmons Energy. Please go ahead. Ryan Todd - Simmons & Company International : Great. Thanks, and congratulations on the good result. Maybe if I could start with one as we think about \u2013 or maybe a couple questions on capital. Can you break down \u2013 I mean, I know you mentioned some of it. A few of the drivers in the $300 million increase to the CapEx budget. And with implied spending falling to just over $1 billion in fourth quarter, which is obviously low, could you give us an idea of maybe what a normalized run rate would be on CapEx right now? And I have a follow-up. Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, Ryan, this is Billy Helms. So, yes, the fourth quarter we expect to be down relative to the third quarter, and that's simply because our activity was planned that way at the start of the year. We are going to have fewer wells completed in the fourth quarter than we did in the third. And as an election of trying to maintain our momentum on driving cost down, we are going to retain some equipment that we'd previously planned to release. In doing so, we'll end up completing about 20 additional wells and that'll be the majority of the increase that we're seeing in the fourth quarter. That will give us momentum going into 2019 by capturing these high-performing service providers and maintaining the efficiency gains that we have realized to-date, we'll be able to continue to drive our well costs down into 2019. We're pretty excited really about the progress we've made on lowering well cost. In general, we'd say our well costs are down about 3% year-to-date across our plays. For example, we're down about 2% in the Eagle Ford. In the Wolfcamp, we're down about 3%. In the Bakken, we're down about 4%. We're making similar progress across all of our plays. And on average, we're about 3% down for the company, headed towards our goal of 5%, which we believe we'll accomplish in the fourth quarter. So, our plan this year was, as everybody recognized, it was loaded to the front end with CapEx. The production showed up really in the third quarter. All intended to drop a little bit in the fourth quarter, so our run rate this year on a capital basis by quarter was a little bit lopsided. Going into 2019, we do not expect to do the same thing. Our 2019 program would be a little more balanced. We can't give you any guidance or any numbers on that yet. We're still working on that. But we would expect the run rate going into next year to be more balanced and then capital efficiency continue to improve, and that's the whole basis at which we allocate capital these days, is we're only going to do so as we can continue to improve our capital efficiency. Ryan Todd - Simmons & Company International : Great. Thanks. And then maybe just at a higher level. I mean, I appreciate the effort to talk about your reinvestment philosophy. But, I guess, how is the right way to think about \u2013 I know growth is an output, but you've got a relatively-unique growth and free cash flow profile. How do you think about balancing more or less growth with more or less free cash flow? And I get returns are a part of it, but you clearly have far more opportunity to deploy capital at high rates of return than you do in any given year. So, where do you draw a line between the amount that you're willing to grow versus a higher or lower amount of free cash? I'll leave it there. Thanks. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Brian, this is Bill. Yeah, certainly, we're very committed to operating within cash flow and generate free cash flow every year. Our goal is to generate free cash flow every year. So, we look at the program every year with not a volume number that we're really focused on. We really look at the program as we've already talked about extensively to continue to get better. So, we want to improve capital efficiency, continue to lower the finding and development costs and improve returns. And we believe we've got a sustainable business model, because it's based on $40 oil, which we believe is well below the marginal cost of oil. So, we've created, as you have already commented on, we've got a very powerful engine and we certainly have the ability to grow very fast, but we're not really focused on growth. We're really focused on getting better at increasing returns. So, every year we throttle back to allow us to learn and get better. And we believe as long as we continue to add new plays, we do not see our growth dropping significantly in the next several years at current prices. Ryan Todd - Simmons & Company International : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Our next question will come from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, good morning. Bill, I wanted to \u2013 if you could elaborate on your comments on capital efficiency being better in 2019 versus 2018. Do you believe that on a spending per unit of production basis, and I'm thinking about oil, that your CapEx dollar will deliver a more oil growth on a year-over-year basis per dollar invested? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yes, Arun. That's absolutely what we believe. It's based on a number of different ideas. The first one, as Billy has already commented on, we're going to get off to a better start, a faster start next year than we did in 2018. And then we really believe we're going to be entering the year at lower cost and higher well productivity than we entered 2018. And we believe with our ability to continue to learn, capture data, integrate the data, analyze the data and put it back into the field very quickly, that we will be able to continue to improve, lower costs and continue to improve our spacing patterns, development patterns and continue to improve well productivity going forward. So our goal every year, not just in 2019, is to get better. And that's a core culture of the company. We've consistently done it for many, many, many years and we do not see any end in that process. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. And just my follow-up, Bill, I totally appreciate the fact that EOG allocates capital on a returns basis. But just had a philosophical question on growth. You guys have previously highlighted a 15% to 25% kind of oil growth outlook, assuming $50 to $60. One question we think about, if you get to the middle part of that range, the organization would essentially have to grow kind of a Parsley Energy in terms of size, in terms of oil growth. So we'd argue maybe towards the lower end of that range, may be better from a longer-term perspective. Would love to hear your thoughts on that. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Well, Arun, again, we don't give you any specific numbers. But in general, just as I've commented, because we have multiple plays, we're developing currently 11 different oil plays in the company, and because we have a very decentralized structure that we can focus our divisions on each one of these plays, put the proper people, the proper process in place to continuously improve, as long as we continue to add new potential to the company every year through that whole process, we believe that our growth will not drop significantly in the next several years at current prices. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. Can you discuss the decision to lock in services costs for 2019? Specifically, do you think that market prices are near trough? And then if you were to create a waterfall for 2019 like you have on slide 16 for 2018, do you think you need to deliver efficiency gains and multiple green bars from here to keep well costs down? Or are you already seeing well costs down year-on-year in 2019 based on the pricing terms you've locked in? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, Brian, this is Billy Helms. Yeah, the decision to go ahead and lock in or capture these service providers that are we think at very favorable prices was really to maintain those efficiencies. We feel like that we're getting some highly efficient crews at what we believe is near the market conditions that we have today, or probably near the low end. We don't know if we can capture the absolute bottom of the trough, but we do feel like we're capturing some of the best providers out there at very favorable prices. So it gives us confidence to be able to continue to lower our well cost in 2019. Yeah, we believe that the momentum we've created on efficiency gains and the progress we're seeing across all of our plays will continue to deliver solid results going into 2019, which is the whole reason we made this decision. We want to \u2013 as we started 2018, we had to pick up quite a few crews and equipment. And certainly those don't operate at the efficiency levels that we anticipate or expect. And it took us a while to get there, but we're very satisfied where we are today and the progress we're making on continuous improvement. We just want to maintain that into 2019. Yeah, we're going to continue to push every one of those categories you mentioned there on that slide 16, I believe, for the Wolfcamp. And I believe that one's going to continue to get better over time. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. And then to follow up on the capital efficiency improving in 2019 point and Arun's follow-up there, you mentioned that well productivity you expect to improve next year. Can you talk about what and where the drivers of that are? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, Brian. This is Bill. It's really in multiple different areas. We're seeing still very significant frac technology applications and improvements. We're seeing better execution in our targets, which we're able to drill even faster and stay in a very narrow window even more precisely than we've done in years past. And we continue to learn how to pick our targets better. So our target selection is better, so just in general, the quality of the rock that we target is improving over time. And all these are incrementally and moving continuously at the same time. So we just don't really see an end or a plateau in being able to improve the company going forward. We have a very sustainable business model, a very sophisticated information technology process. And I think I'll ask Sandeep maybe to comment on some of the things that we're doing in the information system to continue to improve. Sandeep Bhakhri - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, sure, Bill. Yeah, Brian, like Bill said, the main goal is really to continue to improve capital efficiency, and that means drilling better wells for lower cost. And the game-changer for us really has been the ability for us to capture data at a very, very high frequency at a very, very granular level in real-time and deliver it to all our engineers. The level of innovation that is currently that we're seeing continues to amaze me in terms of the inventiveness of our completion engineers and their ability to almost custom design fracs to take advantage of the unique rock that we steered through and the ability of our geosteerers and our G&G folks to continue to fine-tune the target and stay in the real-time basis, regardless of running \u2013 maybe crossing faults even and getting back into zones much faster. The whole system is geared towards becoming better with data, assimilating the understanding of potential depletion, dialing that into the frac designs to make better wells on an ongoing basis. So there's innovations going on in drilling, in completions, in production optimization, all with the goal of improving capital efficiency. So the levers of capital efficiency improvements in 2019, I would say, are just numerous, countless almost. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from Leo Mariani of NatAlliance Securities. Please go ahead. Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities : Hey, guys. Just wanted to follow up a little bit on sort of your comments around capital efficiency. Obviously, you had a really nice ramp in production here in 2018, and certainly as you guys have pointed out, well costs have fallen. So I guess all things being equal, it certainly looks like we're going to see higher operating cash flows in 2019 versus 2018 here. So just high level, should we expect to see some higher overall just activity levels from EOG? And obviously looks like free cash flow will go up. So maybe just talk about sort of prioritizing the uses next year. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, Leo, again, we're going to maintain very strict discipline. So the governor is we're only going to increase spending if we can get better. So that's the absolute thing. I think you've heard that. So the priorities have not changed. We're getting currently, at current prices, we're getting triple-digit rates of returns at the well level. So that's the first priority for cash. We're very excited about new exploration potential that we're generating inside the company. So, we want to continue to pick up better rock at low cost, and we're certainly have debt reduction as a very high priority in the company. And as Tim said, we have already reduced by $350 million this year and we plan to retire another $900 million next year, and we've target over $3 billion of debt reduction over the next \u2013 in four-year period. And then, we want to continue to work on increasing the dividend. We have a very strong commitment to returning cash to our shareholders through the dividend as we increased it 31% this year. And if we have a healthy business environment, we'll evaluate quarterly on that, but our goal is to continue to increase that at stronger than a historical rate of 19% compounded annual growth rate. And then, I just want to reiterate. We have no interest, no need in even thinking about expensive corporate M&As. So, we're very focused and very disciplined, and we're going to continue to remain focused on increasing returns by getting better. Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities : Okay. That's great color. And I also just wanted to focus quickly on the Austin Chalk. I know this is an emerging play for you folks, but obviously you've been in the play for a while. Just wanted to get a sense of where we are in the evolution here. I mean, do you guys feel like you've got a better handle on sort of the economics, as well as just the productive extent of your sizable acreage position at this point in time? Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Hey, Leo. This is Ezra Yacob and, yeah, I think as we've talked about it, we've been developing the Austin Chalk. We've been co-developing it now with our Eagle Ford program and it's a little bit more of a complicated play than the Eagle Ford, certainly. And so, while it's prospective across our entire South Texas acreage position there, the sweet spots are a little more discontinuous. And we've done a very good job integrating not only core data and log data that we've collected while we've been developing the Eagle Ford, but we've also tied that into our seismic coverage, which extends across our entire acreage position. So, yeah, we're feeling very good with it. The benefit that the Austin Chalk also has is that since we do co-develop it with the Eagle Ford and it's within our core area, it benefits from a lot of the existing infrastructure. And, obviously, all the operational performance that we have there that we continue to increase in the Eagle Ford, the Austin Chalk continues to benefit from that. So this quarter we brought on 10 net wells. They had a average 30-day rate there of just over 1,800 barrels of oil per day. And so, we are very happy with the performance of it. Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities : Okay. Thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question will come from Bob Brackett of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning. You mentioned that approximately 65% of anticipated 2019 services have been secured. What is that 65% of? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: That's 65% \u2013 Bob, this is Billy Helms, by the way. This is 65% of our typical average well cost in the company. So, we look at our typical well costs being somewhere in that $6-million range, and it's about 65% of that number. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. So, that's a per-well number, it's not a total capital number? Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.: No. It's a per well. It's an average for the per-well drill and complete cost. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. That's understood. A separate question. If I look at sort of where you are in spacing in the Delaware Basin, there's a fairly-wide range from 660 feet up to 1,000 feet, and it doesn't seem to be a function of depth or oil cut. Can you give some color? What's driving that well spacing? And how fixed are those numbers? Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, Bob. This is Ezra Yacob. So that's a good observation you have. I appreciate the question. The first part of our well spacing, it does actually begin with the oil cut. I think our announced type curves for the oil play where we have 226,000 net acres is based on 660-foot spacing. And then for our combo play, which is a little bit shallower, a little bit less of an oil cut, that type curve is based on an 880-foot spacing. And that would be some of our Reeves County acreage down there. But then more than that, the spacing really across the Permian is going to be tied to the local geology. We continue to kind of monitor the long-term performance, a lot of those spacing and different targeting patterns that we've tested. And we've discussed those on past calls where we've been testing spacing in the oil window down to 500-foot to 700-foot spacing, depending basically on the local geology, the number of targets, and as such. It is a complicated play in the Delaware Basin. But I think what we see this year is we've made tremendous progress on defining kind of our optimal spacing and targeting packages for our core acreage positions. We brought 180 wells in the Wolfcamp to sales this year, and it's reinforced that we feel very confident with our announced resource potential on that type curve at 1.3 million barrels of equivalents. And again, that's for a 7,000-foot lateral at 660-foot spacing. I think the way to think about that 660 feet is if you just look at our remaining premium inventory, that's going to be a good average over that acreage position. We feel very good about the work that's been done this year in the Permian; our ability to increase returns and optimize NPV and ultimately increase the capital efficiency as we finish up 2018 and move into 2019. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Appreciate that. Just to be explicit, those numbers account for things like parent child relationships and down-spacing, well interference effects? Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, that's correct, Bob. When we put our resource potential on our type curves out there, we've baked all of that in. And so as we continue to integrate our data, not only from the early package development, the early and long-term production profiles of the wells, our real-time completions data. As we integrate that into the next well of packages, really we consider the improvements and the gains that we're able to make as upside. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question will come from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Yes, good morning, Bill, to you and your whole team there. I was listening to your prepared comments, and I wanted to go back and explore a little bit the idea that you're ranking these plays at $40 oil. It makes sense to me that your best play at $40 would still be your best play at $60 or $70. But it also seems to me that the way you would develop your assets or your spacing patterns, to pick up on Bob Brackett's point, or how intensively you go after those assets would be different at $60 or $70 than it would at $40. So can you talk about whether you agree with that point of view? And if you do, how you modulate that density aspect of your program? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Charles, we run all of our economics based on our premium price deck of $40 flat and $2.50 flat natural gas prices. So our focus on all of our properties is to develop those to continue to lower the finding costs. That's really, really important; to continue to improve the capital efficiency, that's really, really important; to continue to improve the returns and ultimately, to optimize the NPV. And so we're really able, we believe, to optimize those all at once. And we have a very strict $40 flat, $2.50 flat price deck that we manage the company on. And we believe that will continue to improve the cost structure of the company. And that is what we believe will continue to help us to generate double-digit returns and double-digit growth through the commodity price cycles and that is what will continue to help us become one of the lowest cost producers in the global oil market. So, we're very focused, we're very strict and we're committed to that process. Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Thanks for that clarification, Bill. That's it from me. Operator : Our next question will come from Irene Haas of Imperial Capital. Please go ahead. Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC : Yes. My question is on Powder River Basin. Very glad to see that the company is preemptively working on infrastructure. And my question has to do with just permitting on the state and federal level, how is it coming along? Any progress on the EIS? And also, really any gating factor that needs to be taken care of before you guys really, really ramp up, such as oil and gas takeaway. David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yes, Irene. This is David Trice. On the regulatory side, we have captured the permits that we need for operatorship out there. So, we've been busy doing that for really the last couple years. As you know, Wyoming's kind of a capture-the-flag state, so you have to actually file the permit to get operatorship no matter what your interest is there. And so we've done that for essentially all of our acreage out there. And as far as the infrastructure goes, we had mentioned on our last call that 2019 was really where we're going to be focused on adding infrastructure and takeaway. Our drilling activity will not be up significantly in 2019. It'll probably be up slightly there, but mainly the focus in 2019 is going to be more focused on putting the pieces in place to go ahead and bring the Powder forward in 2020 and beyond. Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC : Okay. May I have a follow up? Feels like the basin really kind of benefits larger well-organized producers kind of like EOG with scope and scale. So, are there any bolt-on that might make sense down the line for EOG, understanding that you guys are not into buying big companies? David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, again, I think I'd reiterate what Bill said earlier. I mean, we're certainly not interested in any of these expensive corporate-level acquisitions. We're always looking to add high-quality acreage at low cost. And so, if some bolt-on would make sense and it's low cost, then we would certainly look at it. But again, our focus is more on the exploration side, finding low cost, high-quality acreage. Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Subash Chandra of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Yeah, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you guys could just comment on some public data that's out there. Just showing I guess in New Mexico the well results being sort of incrementally lower than in prior years. And if that's sort of a data integrity thing, or if there's something else going on and this is just an interim event. Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, Subash. This is Ezra Yacob. With the results in the Delaware Basin there in the New Mexico portion, I'm not sure if I can speak directly to the state data that you're seeing, but what I will say is we're very pleased with the results that we're seeing out there. As I discussed earlier in the opening remarks, all of our well performance are actually outperforming their respective type curves for each of the plays that we're drilling. And we've made a tremendous amount of progress this year. I think this quarter's early time 30-day results are actually the highest of the year this year. And part of that is those quarter-over-quarter numbers will move around a little bit, just depending on which package of wells you're bringing on from which part of the basin. But, really, I think, in general, our team out there has done a great job integrating the data from some of our packages that we've been drilling early in the year, making some adjustments to the spacing and targeting, as well as on the completion side and really increasing the well productivity of those wells, and I think that's showing up a little bit here in this last quarter. In addition to that, as Billy highlighted, we're making pretty good gains on our operational efficiency, which is translating into lower well costs. And so, when you combine those two things together, we're seeing a decrease in our finding and development costs in the plays which are resulting in better returns and a higher capital efficiency, which is what our goal is for that basin. Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Yeah, thanks, Ezra. State data can be a dangerous thing. That's why I thought I'd ask. The second question is just in the Eastern Anadarko. If this next batch of wells was the very similar sort of high rate artificial lift. And if so, would this open up maybe some other plays for you that are not as in the geo-pressured areas as you typically prefer? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Could we get the first part of your question? We didn't quite understand the first sentence. Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Yeah. Sure, sure. My understanding is, at least in East Anadarko, is that the wells are brought on with very high rate gas lift. And I could be wrong there. So just curious if that's the situation or not. And if it is, if there's other plays better in less geo-pressured areas that you can apply a similar artificial lift on the front end to open the plays up. David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, this is David Trice. Yes, in Anadarko Basin we do use gas lift there. We bring those wells on initially with gas lift, and really throughout the life of the well. We use gas lift really throughout the company. So that's nothing new for us. In the Eastern Anadarko, we do it a little bit different than we do in other areas, but basically, it's the same around the company. And it's a very low-cost method that we use and we get a very good return and LOE on that. Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you for the clarification. Operator : The next question will come from Paul Sankey of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. And we'll move on to the next question. The next question will come from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Please go ahead. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good morning, and congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to just quickly return to this discussion of the premium locations and just ask is it fair to think that even though they're all great, some of the locations are better than others? Or maybe to put it another way, since all the premium locations have high potential for outperforming, what informs the choice to develop some of them now and wait on others for later? William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yes, all the premium locations are quite outstanding. They're quite different, I believe, than the average well that the industry's drilling. So they're at a very high, elevated level. And, of course, it's a huge inventory. It's 9,500 locations and some of them are much better than others. And as we continue to add to that premium inventory, our goal is to bring the quality of the inventory up, just like we'd drill, build the quantity of the inventory. And so we do develop all of it. And we believe that every well in the inventory and every play in that inventory has got continuous room for improvement going forward. And so we develop the plays based on returns, and the allocation of the capital in the company is strictly based on returns. And so we drill the highest rate of return wells we have and rank them in the company every year. And we develop them on a play basis. And the pace of learning in the company, because of the information technology and the culture in the company, continues to increase. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. Well, that was very helpful. I appreciate that. I'll ask a more narrow question for my follow-up. I noticed on the call you mentioned there's going be a spacing test of the Mowry and the Niobrara together. And so I'm just wondering, since the Turner wasn't mentioned, does that imply that the Turner sweet spots are discrete from the premium Mowry and Niobrara locations? David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.: Yeah, Jeff. This is David again. On the Turner, we feel like we understand that play a lot better. We've been drilling the Turner for years and we've done various tests over the years, and so we have a good handle already on what the spacing should be in the Turner. Just the fact that the Mowry and the Niobrara are new, we're going to go ahead and do some spacing test there, similar to what we did in the Woodford. And so, we're planning to do those. Those are two separate tests and we're going to do those at 660-foot spacing. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks for that clarification. I appreciate it. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Thomas. William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.: In closing, our third quarter results were outstanding. The company continues to improve systematically by lowering costs and improving productivity with new technology and efficiency gains. Many thanks again to all the EOG employees for demonstrating the innovative, returns-focused cultures that makes EOG successful. Our culture is a driving force of the company's sustainable business model and we're excited about the future and our ability to continue to create significant long-term shareholder value. Thanks for listening and thanks for your support. Operator : The conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir. Tim Driggers : Thank you, and good morning. Thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing fourth quarter and full-year 2018 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG\u2019s SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions as well as reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential, not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC\u2019s reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our earnings release issued yesterday. Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Ezra Yacob, EVP Exploration and Production; and David Streit, VP, Investor and Public Relations. Here\u2019s Bill Thomas. Bill Thomas : Thanks, Tim, and good morning everyone. Our long-term game plan is simple, be one of the best performing companies across all sectors in the S&P 500. Our goal is to deliver double-digit returns and double-digit growth throughout commodity price cycles. In addition to high returns and disciplined organic growth, our goal is to generate free cash flow that supports a growing dividend and impeccable balance sheet and allows the company to take advantage of other opportunities, such as bolt-on property additions that meet our strict premium reinvestment standard or potential opportunities to repurchase shares when value accretive. In 2018, EOG accomplished our goal by delivering 15% return on capital employed, organically growing oil production 19% and generating $1.7 billion in free cash flow. Our 2018 performance places EOG among the very best, in line with top performers in any sector of the market. Last year, we earned a company record adjusted net income of $3.2 billion. Our 2018 15% return on capital employed at $65 oil surpassed our 2014 return on capital employed when oil prices averaged significantly higher at $95. It\u2019s clear, our permanent shift to premium strategy three years ago has had a dramatic effect on the profitability of the company. EOG\u2019s premium standard requires investments to earn at least 30% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. Consistently applying this standard to our capital allocation decisions has reset the company to be successful throughout commodity price cycles. In addition to double-digit returns and growth in 2018, we also generated a company record of $1.7 billion in free cash flow, increased the dividend rate 31% and reduced our net debt to capitalization ratio from 25% to 19%, delivering high-return organic growth producing free cash flow, returning cash to shareholders by increasing the dividend and reducing our debt is a significant achievement. This combination is rare, not only in our industry, but in the broader market. Our ambition is to make this level of performance to norm for EOG Resources. Consistent with our long-term game plan, our 2019 $6.3 billion capital program is forecasted to deliver 12% to 16% U.S. oil production growth. We\u2019re excited about 2019, because we\u2019re building on our cost reduction momentum from last year. Per barrel cost \u2013 per barrel cash operating cost are expected to go down again this year. We continue to both improve well productivity and lower well costs and estimate that the average 2019 well will generate $6 million net present value at $55 oil. These improvements are expected to increase our capital efficiency by more than 10%. As a result, the price of oil needed to fund our 2019 capital and the dividend with discretionary cash flow is less than $50. With oil at $55, we expect to generate significant free cash flow. Our 2019 disciplined growth and capital program will allow the company to increase returns by discovering and applying new technological breakthroughs, improving operating efficiencies and continuously reducing cost in every area of our business. Accordingly, we are spending a bit less this year on growing oil and a bit more on opportunistic proprietary new horizontal potential. Applying our proprietary knowledge, we believe the new prospects have the potential to meaningfully improve the quality of our drilling inventory and improve our future returns. Today, it takes oil prices in the mid-50s for EOG to generate double-digit return on capital employed, and in the foreseeable future, we see that price dropping into the 40s. It would be incorrect to assume that EOG is permanently shifting into a lower-growth mode. Our goal is to continue to lower our break-even costs, improve margins and reset the company to sustainably deliver double-digit returns and double-digit growth throughout commodity price cycles. EOG continues to be the peer leader in return on capital employed and disciplined growth. We are rapidly becoming one of the low-cost producers in the global energy market and we embrace a strong commitment to sustainability. Our goal of double-digit returns, double-digit growth and free cash flow puts EOG in line with the best companies across all sectors in the market. We are truly excited about 2019, and our ability to continue to improve and to deliver significant long-term shareholder value. Next up is Billy to review our operational performance in 2018 and provide details on our 2019 plan. Billy Helms : Thanks, Bill. Our high-return production growth in 2018 is a result of investing in our diverse inventory of premium drilling across 11 plays in six different basins. EOG\u2019s 2018 performance illustrates the perseverance of our operating teams to continually get better by improving both well productivity and reducing cost, the two key components that drive sustainable improvements in capital efficiency. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we made the decision to maintain activity and retain top-performing service providers in order to accomplish these two specific goals. As a result, and in the face of increasing oil prices and service cost inflation throughout most of 2018, EOG achieved a 3% reduction in the average well cost by the fourth quarter. To be clear, the cost improvements are not from decreases in service cost, instead the lower cost are due to more efficient operations from faster drilling speeds, increased completion stages per day, reduced sand cost, water recycling and infrastructure projects. In addition, you can see the improvements in well productivity across our plays, with the fourth quarter well results provided in the presentation slides. Our 2019 program is built upon these already proven results of the existing domestic program. Furthermore, our operating teams continue to deliver results consistent with the well cost and productivity achieved last year. As a result, the momentum carried from 2018 gives us confidence that we can achieve the 2019 plan objectives. In addition, by retaining these services, we have secured about 65% of our anticipated services and materials requirements for 2019. We negotiated terms at both lock in services cost and maintain flexibility to adjust our activity level depending on market conditions. However, it is important to note that we will not increase capital should oil prices increase. We forecast our 2019 $6.3 billion capital program will deliver 12% to 16% U.S. oil production growth. Every one of our major plays is expected to contribute to that growth. The plan is designed to generate significant free cash flow and is balanced below $50, meaning, we can cover our capital and dividend with discretionary cash flow. The 2019 plan includes slightly more capital for gathering and processing and other facilities, which largely consist of additional water and oil gathering infrastructure in our major plays. In Trinidad, we allocated a small increase as well for its drilling program in 2019. Our domestic development program spend will be slightly lower, but much more capital-efficient due to advances made last year. In addition, we continue to make progress in advancing new completion technology that we believe will further improve well productivity and reduce completion cost. Early results indicate measurable increases in production performance. In addition to what is assumed in our 2019 plan, we have set further ambitious goals, including reducing total well cost another 5%, lowering all-in finding cost 10%, improving well productivity through the application of new technology, 90% of wells drilled meeting the premium definition and adding new premium inventory at a pace faster than we are drilling it. Finally, our 2019 plan includes more capital for exploration of new drilling potential. Here\u2019s Ezra to update you on those efforts. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Billy. Our decentralized structure allows our asset teams to identify high-quality unconventional reservoirs and capture acreage as the first mover with low-entry costs. Our ability to capture the sweet spots of these plays is the most significant reason we consistently drill top tier performing wells. Currently, we are leveraging proprietary knowledge from numerous plays across our portfolio and have identified multiple opportunities. We\u2019re focused on applying our technical knowledge of horizontal drilling and completions to higher-quality unconventional reservoirs, and we\u2019ll be leasing acreage and drilling our initial test wells in 2019. Our goal is to increase the quality of our inventory with new plays that can deliver higher production at lower costs, providing a vehicle for continued improvement of our finding costs, DD&A rate and ultimately ROCE. By focusing more resources to these new innovative play concepts, we\u2019re taking advantage of market conditions to opportunistically add low-cost, high-return inventory to our portfolio. I\u2019ll now discuss our Delaware Basin results, where we produced more than 220,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018, making it our fastest growing asset for the third year in a row. Oil production grew nearly 50%, averaging 127,000 barrels of oil per day, with more than 260 net wells going to sales. In addition, we more than replaced those wells, identifying 375 net new premium locations last year. We also made significant progress blocking up our acreage through trade adding 600,000 feet of premium treated lateral, which is the equivalent of about 85 well locations. Last year, we focused our attention on developing larger packages, drilling longer laterals and increasing our operational efficiency across our 400,000-plus net acre position in the Delaware Basin. The results of this effort includes a 31% increase in completed lateral feet per day, a 9% decrease in completions cost and an 18% reduction in drilling days per well. We also continued strategic expansion of our oil, gas and water infrastructure. In 2018, we put into service an oil gathering system and terminal across the core of our acreage position. This system and terminal will ultimately have up to five connections to downstream markets, where we secured firm capacity to Cushing and Corpus Christi. In 2018, we flowed about half of our oil production through this system, resulting in over $22 million in transportation savings. We will realize increased savings in 2019 as additional wells are connected to this oil system. Our current target is to have 85% of our oil production on pipe by year-end. The first-half of 2018 was also marked by extensive learnings from spacing tests, both horizontally within one target and staggered vertically across multiple targets. From our test, we gathered a tremendous amount of drilling completions and production data and have applied those learnings to our development program. Optimizing our target spacing and completions designs based on local geology resulted in an increased well performance during the second-half of 2018. Our Delaware Basin program last year highlights our ability to quickly transform data collection and analytics into better well productivity and lower well cost in order to optimize the returns and NPV of this world-class asset. Using what we learned in 2018 to refine our spacing and staggered development patterns, combined with new completion technology, we expect to continue to improve well productivity throughout 2019. Next up is Ken to review highlights on our Eagle Ford and Woodford Oil Window plays. Kenneth Boedeker : Thanks, Ezra. 2019 marks our 10th-year developing the Eagle Ford. This workhorse asset remains EOG\u2019s premier oil play, delivering a consistent performance year-after-year. The Eagle Ford grew oil production by 9% last year to 171,000 barrels of oil per day, representing 43% of EOG\u2019s total crude oil production. Even after 10 years, we continue to learn and improve well productivity, find efficiencies and lower costs. We extended laterals another 7% from 2017, primarily on our western acreage, where there is less faulting. In fact, we drilled a record 65 wells, with laterals over 10,000 feet in 2018. We continue to push the limits of lateral length, setting a record with our Slytherin C#3H at 13,500 feet of treated lateral length. Wells in our western acreage produce lower IPs, but have slightly lower decline rates and are more cost-efficient. In 2018, we updated our premium inventory for the Eagle Ford, adding 145 net locations through infills, acreage bolt-ons and longer laterals. We\u2019re confident we can continue to drive sustainable cost efficiencies in our effort to convert the remaining inventory of our total 7,200 net locations to premium status. In 2018, we also continue to see very positive results in our secondary recovery efforts in the Eagle Ford. Results to date are in line with our early expectations for this enhanced oil recovery process and we have approximately 150 wells in various stages of injection and production. We\u2019re continuing to refine our technique and expect this project to grow in the future. We have found that this process works best, when infill development has been completed throughout the area. So we\u2019re focusing our efforts in 2019 towards finishing primary development of nearby units before expanding our secondary recovery footprint. In 2019, we plan to complete 300 net wells in the Eagle Ford due to capital efficiency gains, we expect to spend almost 10% less capital for a similar number of wells as 2018. In the Anadarko Basin Woodford Oil Window, we\u2019re building operational momentum. We introduced this play at the end of 2017, ramped up our development in 2018 and more than doubled production. The Woodford Oil Play is a concentrated sweet spot of moderately over-pressured high-quality permeable rock located primarily in McClain County, Oklahoma. These wells are low decline, low GOR and produce an average of 42 degree API oil. We made significant improvements in well cost last year by improving our operational efficiency and we expect to carry those improvements forward into 2019, with a new target well cost of $7.6 million. Highlight from activity during the fourth quarter of 2018 was our GALAXY 2536 well. This well\u2019s estimated ultimate recovery is 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. In its first 30 days, it averaged 1,400 barrels of oil per day and 1,950 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Based on spacing and targeting test last year, we believe the right distance between wells is less than 660 feet. In 2019, we\u2019ll conduct additional targeting tests and continue to use new completion technology that we expect will allow for closer well spacing. Our initial resource estimate of more than 200 million barrels of oil equivalent was based on 660-foot spacing. So there is additional upside in this play. We\u2019re very optimistic we can expand our current inventory of 260 net premium locations. In 2019, we plan to slightly increase Woodford Oil Window completions to roughly 13 net wells and expect will more than double production again. Now here\u2019s Billy to review our Bakken and Rockies plays. Billy Helms : Thanks, Ken. The Bakken remains an important asset in EOG\u2019s diverse portfolio of plays, providing flexibility for reinvestment at our premium return hurdle rate. Over the last several years, we\u2019ve made significant progress in the Williston Basin on precision targeting, the drilling and completion efficiencies. Between better well production and tremendous cost improvements, our Bakken program delivered over 70% direct well level returns. In 2019, we\u2019ll continue to focus our 20 net well plan in the Bakken core and expand our development of the Antelope Extension. The Antelope Extension is part of our Williston Basin core acreage and the area now benefits from additional midstream infrastructure and takeaway capacity, driving better economics through reduced transportation cost and LOE. We are also testing new completion technology and are optimistic that it will improve productivity and lower cost. 2018 was an incredible year for operational improvements in our Rockies plays in the Powder River and DJ Basins. We increased our completions efficiency dramatically, achieving a 38% improvement in feet of treated lateral per day. Our cost to drill averaged just $100 per foot and drilling days declined 20%. Rockies-wide, we either met or beat all of our cost targets for the year by the end of the first quarter of 2018. In the Powder River Basin, our core acreage doubled to more than 400,000 net acres following the 2016 Yates merger. In 2018, we added more than 1,500 premium net drilling locations and nearly 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent of net resource potential through the addition of Mowry and Niobrara shale plays and new locations identified in the Turner sand. Furthermore, as we continue to block up our acreage position, we see significant upside to add to our premium inventory over time. During the fourth quarter, two Powder River Basin Mowry wells came online, delivering an average 30-day initial production of more than 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the Powder River Basin Turner, we completed four wells that averaged 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the first 30 days. Last year, we moved the DJ Basin into full development and produced record volumes of nearly 30,000 barrels of oil per day. But the bigger story in the DJ was drilling performance. Average drilling days were already an impressive 4.4 days and we reduced another 7% to 4.1 days. Due to lower pressure, the IP rates aren\u2019t as flashy as some other plays, but these are some of the lowest-cost wells in the company and they consistently deliver premium level returns. The sustainable improvements we have made to the cost structure of the Powder River Basin and the DJ Basin over the last year, combined with moderate decline wells, drove record low finding cost and record high returns in 2018. Performance from our Rockies plays are highly competitive with our largest premium assets. Here\u2019s Ken to review our year-end reserve replacement and finding cost. Kenneth Boedeker : Thanks, Billy. We had a great year for reserve replacement, more than doubling what we produced during the year. Our proved reserves increased over 400 million barrels of oil equivalent, or 16% year-over-year to $2.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We replaced 238% of our 2018 production at a low finding cost of $9.33 per Boe, which excludes positive revisions due to commodity price improvements. Since the start of the downturn in 2014, we have reduced finding cost 30%. Our ability to consistently add reserves at low-cost demonstrates the tremendous capital efficiency gains we made through the downturn from our permanent shift to premium drilling and laser-focus on cost reductions. Every year, EOG engages DeGolyer and MacNaughton to perform an independently engineered analysis of our reserves. This year, they evaluated nearly 80% of EOG\u2019s proved reserves. And for the 31st consecutive year, they were within 5% of our internal estimates. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss our financials and capital structure. Tim Driggers : Thanks, Ken. EOG further strengthened its financial position in the fourth quarter. The company generated discretionary cash flow of $2.1 billion, invested $1.3 billion in exploration and development expenditures and paid $127 million in dividends. Free cash flow was $637 million in the fourth quarter and totaled almost $1.7 billion for the full-year 2018. Proceeds from asset sales for 2018 totaled $227 million, which was predominantly the UK sale, including the Conway Field. Cash on the balance sheet at December 31 was $1.6 billion and total debt was $6.1 billion, for a net debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 19%, down from 25% at the end of 2017. Our goal is to repay $3 billion of debt from 2018 through 2021. We took a step in this direction by repaying a $350 million bond that came to maturity on October 1. In 2019, we have a $900 million bond scheduled to mature on June 1. We will determine the funding for this bond replacement closer to the date of maturity, whether from cash on hand or other sources based on the company\u2019s financial condition at that time. EOG is currently unhedged for the price of oil or gas for 2019, with the exception of some contracts protecting the price differential between certain sales points. Historically, EOG has hedged up to 50% of our expected production. While our best hedge position is being a low-cost producer, we will continue to evaluate hedging opportunities with the objective of prudently managing our business and providing our shareholders upside to commodity prices. I\u2019ll turn it back over to Bill for closing remarks. Bill Thomas : Thanks, Tim. In conclusion, our goal is simple, to be one of the best performing companies in the S&P 500. Our business model of high return organic growth is driven by our culture of return focused decision-making, low-cost operations, innovation, technology and a first mover advantage. We have a pleased, but not satisfied mindset that motivates every fiber of our company to continuously improve. EOG\u2019s core business acumen, organic exploration, low-cost operations, advanced information technology and sustainability powered by our never satisfied innovative culture means, EOG has not remotely peaked. We are excited about our future and our ability to achieve our goal of delivering double-digit returns, double-digit growth and free cash flow throughout commodity price cycles. EOG\u2019s premium combination is rare in the energy sector and places EOG in line with the top performers in any sector of the market. It is a unique and compelling combination we expect to demonstrate again this year and over the long-term to create significant value for our shareholders. Thanks for listening. And now, we\u2019ll go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you, sir. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead. Neal Dingmann : Good morning, guys. Great details. My question is just you guys have done a great job continuing to bring out another of these distinct premium plays. Just as you continue to look at some of your exploration opportunities, your thoughts about the potential for \u2013 potentially another one of these rolling out this year or next? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Neal, this is Ezra Yacob. As we discussed in the opening remarks, and I think it\u2019s \u2013 you can see a good illustration on Slide 11 on the presentation. We\u2019re really focused on adding higher-quality plays to the inventory as we\u2019ve done over the past couple of years as opposed to just increasing the quantity. We\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019re utilizing a lot of data captured over the last few years in the Permian and the Powder and the Woodford to develop some new horizontal play concepts. And we\u2019re really focused on applying our horizontal drilling and completions techniques to a higher-quality unconventional reservoir some that we\u2019ve identified. And as we said, we\u2019ll be leasing and drilling some test wells in those \u2013 in 2019. And so the important thing, the way to think about it really is, since we\u2019re just kind of leasing and testing those this year, we probably won\u2019t have a potential exploration announcement. But we\u2019ll be able to update you as we gather more data on these. Neal Dingmann : Okay. And then just sticking with that for my follow-up just on that Slide 11 with total locations, how do you all think there has been some diversion out there? Some folks are thinking about more of an ROR focused, up-spacing versus others thinking they\u2019re still maximizing units by downspacing to get more locations. So again, I\u2019m just wondering sort of your philosophy these days and how that might impact total locations? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Neal, this is Ezra again. I think, it\u2019s a combination, not really up-spacing. What we try to do as far as converting existing non-premium wells into the premium status is really through two different mechanisms. The first is lowering well costs and dominantly doing that through sustainable kind of operational efficiency gains. But then also making strides on both the high grading of our targets and especially in 2018 advancing our completions technology, where we can actually improve the well productivity. And so, again, it\u2019s a combination of increasing well productivity and lowering cost to get those across our premium threshold. Neal Dingmann : Great. Thanks, Ezra for the great details. Operator : The next question will be from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Arun Jayaram : Yes, good morning. My first question relates to Delaware Basin. One of the SMID operators yesterday commented how children well recoveries were lagging parent wells by 15% to 20%, which is a delta relative to the Street. Bill, I was wondering if you could comment on EOG\u2019s published type curves, as well as Billy\u2019s commentary on some of the new advances in completion that you\u2019ve announced, as well as the improvement in Delaware Basin well productivity in the second-half of the year? Bill Thomas : Yes, Arun, thank you for the question. If you see the data we\u2019ve released, our well productivity is beginning to improve significantly in most of the plays in the Delaware. And we have been tackling and addressing the parent-child relationship for a number of years and we\u2019re \u2013 we have made significant improvements. I think the company\u2019s ability to absorb data real-time and to make changes very quickly in our drilling programs in our well patterns has really paid off. So the new completion \u2013 ours that we\u2019re using connects more rock. It also reduces the offset depletion effects and we also improved our targeting and our spacing. And to go back what Ezra talked about just recently, we\u2019ve been able to do this and not really reduce. We\u2019ve actually increased the recovery and we\u2019ve increased the NPV and we\u2019ve increased the rate of return all at the same time. So we made tremendous progress on solving the parent-child relationship. Arun Jayaram : Great. Just \u2013 and my follow-up, Bill, could you maybe discuss the tradeoff before \u2013 between investing in premium locations today versus new plays? It seems to us that you\u2019re investing early to prevent an inventory situation down the road. So \u2013 and also so you wouldn\u2019t have to make expensive M&A in order to preserve your trends, but I would love to hear your thoughts on that? Bill Thomas : Sure, Arun. Yes, the total focus on the new plays is to add better inventory. We have 9,500 premium locations right now. So we really don\u2019t need more, we just need better. And so we\u2019re \u2013 as Ezra talked about, we are targeting rocks that have better ability to produce oil and be able to respond to these new completion techniques that we\u2019re coming up with, and to reduce our costs, increase our returns and make the company better in the future. So our total focus on all that is to add a lot better inventory than we have right now. And we are being able to add \u2013 or able to add at very, very low costs. So we\u2019re actively leasing in plays like $500, certainly, less than a $1,000 an acre. And that certainly much, much better than trying to compete in these hot areas through M&A. Arun Jayaram : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question will be from Paul Grigel of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Paul Grigel : Hi, good morning. Referencing the Slide 13, could you please provide color on the methodology on how the corporate decline rate was derived? And adding in additional color for any variations by major basin? And how does this on the corporate decline rate and the capital efficiencies compare historically prior to 2018? Billy Helms : Yes, Paul, this is Billy Helms. Thanks for asking about Slide 13. It\u2019s a new slide that we put into illustrate the confidence we have in improving our capital efficiency year-over-year. We\u2019ve made tremendous strides on both lowering our well cost and improving the productivity of the wells and is starting to dramatically show up. And this slide is based on not forecasting additional cost reductions, but based on our results we\u2019re seeing today in the wells we\u2019re completing here at year-end. So we\u2019re very confident. And basically, the way you calculate the decline from that, if you go back and look at the production year-over-year, you can see the production in 2017 to 2018 and the capital number there $5.9 billion divided into those differences will give you the \u2013 and the capital efficiency number will give you the decline rate in 2018. And you do the same mechanism for 2019 using the midpoint of our guidance, compared to the 2018 production volumes with that capital efficiency number you can back into the decline rate of 31%, as it illustrates here on the slide. Year-over-year, our capital efficiency is improving. But as we grow volumes, those first year volumes, of course, are \u2013 have a steeper decline in the base production. So year-over-year, the base decline did increase from 2018 to 2019. And that\u2019s just simply, because the volumes are getting much bigger. So that tells you that we\u2019re adding \u2013 for the same amount of dollars, we\u2019re adding a lot more new oil at our capital efficiency rate that we have today. So that\u2019s the implication. Paul Grigel : Great. I appreciate the color there. And then could you also provide your latest thoughts on the Austin Chalk, and if that falls within the premium category or in the exploration spend? And what\u2019s the driver of moving to 15 completions in 2019 and the Austin Chalk down from 27 in 2018? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Paul, this is Ezra again. So the Austin Chalk there in South Texas that we\u2019ve talked about is considered part of our premium plays there, where it overlies with our Eagle Ford development program. As far as \u2013 it\u2019s been documented out there that we\u2019ve got some other exploration opportunities there in the Austin Chalk. And that part of it would be considered in the exploration spend. As far as the well counts there in Austin Chalk and the Eagle Ford area, that\u2019s just going to \u2013 simply the wells that we have put to \u2013 the wells that we\u2019re forecasting and put to sale this year are with respect to where we\u2019re at in our development program there. As you know, geologically, as we\u2019ve talked about, it\u2019s a bit of a complicated \u2013 a little more complex than the Eagle Ford down in South Texas. And so we\u2019re really moving a little bit slower on that and making sure that the premium wells that we\u2019re drilling on there are the quality that will be additive to our program. Paul Grigel : Thanks, Ezra. Operator : The next question will be from Leo Mariani of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Leo Mariani : Hey, guys, just wanted to follow-up on a couple of your prepared comments here on the call. I guess, you guys previously had kind of talked about in the last year sort of 15% to 25% oil growth at $50 to $60. Bill, I think, you said in your prepared comments that you\u2019re not really moving away from that over the next couple of years. But growth a little bit lower this year at sort of 12% to 16%. Can you provide a little bit more sort of color as this maybe just a little bit lower year due to more uncertainty around oil prices? Kind of what\u2019s driving you to move towards the lower-end of that range in 2019 here? Bill Thomas : Yes. Leo, this is Bill. We\u2019re not shifting into a low double-digit growth mode that needs to be really clear. We\u2019re not really shifting down into a lower mode and maybe we \u2013 people might think. Specifically, this year, we\u2019re allocating a bit less capital to drilling oil and a bit more capital to drilling for new potential. So that affects this year\u2019s rate a little bit. But certainly, as we\u2019ve demonstrated in the past, we have tremendous ability to grow. It\u2019s really easy for EOG to grow with our capital efficiency so high and such a huge deep high-quality inventory. But we said governors with our disciplined growth strategy, investment governors. And so the first one is, we want to generate free cash flow every year; and the second one is, we want to grow at a pace, where we can take advantage of the learning curve and continue to increase our returns and capital efficiency. So as we continue to get better and increase efficiency and add new higher \u2013 even higher quality inventory than we have right now, it will become easier for us to grow and to sustain and deliver strong high return growth. So don\u2019t count us shifting into a lower mode. Leo Mariani : Okay, that\u2019s great color. And I guess, I just wanted to also follow-up on a comment that you guys made. You certainly are focused on continuing to improve ROCE at EOG, kind of clearly want to lower that over time, because I know you\u2019re spending more money on kind of some newer domestic plays this year. And as I kind of think about that, I guess, I would, maybe assume that maybe the newer plays would initially have a lower ROCE, but might sort of payoff in the longer-term here. So just trying to get a sense of how you square that up with having a really long inventory already. Clearly, you guys have said, you\u2019ve got well north of 10 years of premium oil drilling, even at an accelerated pace over time. So I guess, can you provide a little bit more color on sort of the need to kind of target some more annuity plays with more new exploration dollars here in the short-term? Bill Thomas : Yes. Leo, this is Bill again. That\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re focused on with our exploration effort is to improve our ability to deliver return on capital employed. And because we\u2019re able to acquire this \u2013 these positions at very, very low-cost, $500, $1,000 an acre. And they\u2019re in areas where there infrastructure. We\u2019re not in remote areas that \u2013 they\u2019re not going to be difficult to connect really good markets. They\u2019re in areas where we have very capable operating efficiencies with our seven domestic divisions in the company. And so we can move on them and we can test them very quickly and evaluate them. And then pretty quickly within a year or so, we could put them in a pretty strong development mode. And so we \u2013 we\u2019re taking our advantage of being first movers in these plays and getting there before other people may not \u2013 may realize the potential of them. And we\u2019re focused on better rock than we have right now. And those \u2013 that combination of low-cost and better productivity, we believe could meaningfully improve the returns of the company and down the road will improve our ability to deliver oil at even lower prices and generate return on capital employed at even lower prices. Leo Mariani : Okay, thanks. Great color. Operator : The next question will be from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead. Charles Meade : Good morning, Bill to you and your whole team there. I\u2019d like to start with a kind of a big picture question, and this may go over some old territory for you guys. But looking at Slide 14, it looks like the way you guys built your capital program as you decided, you picked an oil price and said, okay, we want to able to fund our dividend. And so our CapEx has to be something less than our cash flow minus our dividend there. And I get the picture that free cash flow will just \u2013 will accrue as oil prices perhaps role in higher than that. But can you offer, I guess, a color on whether that is the way that you built your capital program? And if that is the right meat on it, could you give some insights into the process of how you pick that $50 oil or whatever that planning price would seems to be the kind of the organizing data point at the time of holding? Bill Thomas : Yes, Charles, this is Bill. Yes, we use multiple parameters to set our program every year. But certainly, one of the first ones is, we want to build a program based on our view of the macro certainly, what oil prices might be and put us in a position to generate free cash flow every year. So that\u2019s the first one. And so, over the last several years, $50 has been a good rule of thumb for that and it\u2019s worked really well for us. And then our goal is to set the capital allocation at a rate that will continue to improve our returns. So that we can take advantage of the learning curve and continue to get better every year and continue to improve our capital efficiency. So with that in mind, we set the program to give us a good chance to generate significant free cash flow to do the things that we\u2019ve talked about reducing our debt and certainly, being able to have the ability to work on the dividend on a much stronger rate than we have in the past years and to get better at the same time. Charles Meade : That\u2019s helpful, Bill. I think I\u2019m picking up what you guys are putting out there on \u2013 in that respect. And then, I mean, going back to some of the prepared comments, I believe, by Ezra about the improvements in the Delaware Basin oil productivity. And I know you guys have talked on this a little bit, but you\u2019ve talked about optimizing the spacing and staggering. Can you give us a bit more detail as \u2013 does that mean that you guys have gotten closer or rather wider on your Delaware Basin well patterns? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Charles, this is Ezra. Really, when you look at it over the bulk of the year between 2017 and 2018, I think, on average, our spacing was pretty consistent. As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, it really is going to change across that base and depending on how many of our specific targets that we\u2019re aiming for in developing and co-developing. And we aim to target as we\u2019ve talked about before, any targets that are kind of within maybe a couple of hundred feet of each other. And so as we talk about the improvements and optimization of spacing vertically and horizontally, it\u2019s if you think about it in a stacked and staggered manner. And so we\u2019ve definitely tested as we highlighted on one of the earlier calls last year as tight as a 400 \u2013 approximately 400-foot staggered spacing pattern. And obviously, we\u2019ve targeted much wider than that. I think at the end of the day what we\u2019re seeing is, there\u2019s a lot of potential upside there to our announced resource potential. As you recall, our type curve in the Wolfcamp Oil Window is based on a 660-foot spacing in just one Wolfcamp target across the whole of our Wolfcamp oil acreage. Charles Meade : Okay. Thank you for that color, Ezra. Operator : The next question will be from Michael Scialla of Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Scialla : Good morning, everybody. Based on your comments that the exploration ideas are really targeting better quality rock, is it fair to say that you\u2019re really not looking at kind of the massive traditional shale plays like the Eagle Ford or the Bakken, I\u2019m thinking maybe more along the lines of tight sand or carbonate resource plays, I mean, you admitted, I guess, the Chalk over in Louisiana is one of them. But is that more the type of play that you\u2019re looking at with the exploration ideas? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Michael, this is Ezra again. That\u2019s a great question. Without giving too much away, what I would say is, just reiterate again what we talked about, and I think you\u2019re on the right track with it is we are targeting \u2013 we\u2019re looking to apply our horizontal drilling and completions technology to in general just better rock quality in these unconventional reservoirs. It\u2019s a variety of different things that we\u2019re looking at. And really, it comes from combining datasets, as I said, that we\u2019ve collected over the last few years in development in the Permian and the Powder and including the Woodford also. And so the way to think about it really is that, the actual rock quality is going to be better than what we\u2019ve traditionally targeted horizontally. And I think that\u2019s what really we want to \u2013 is going to help us increase the quality of our inventory. And it should hopefully shallow the decline that these unconventional plays are kind of known for. And really that should help reduce our finding cost, lower our DD&A and play into helping us achieve our long-term goals of double-digit growth and double-digit returns. Michael Scialla : Okay, thanks. And Bill you said in your opening remarks that you would be willing to buyback shares when accretive of just wondering what metrics you\u2019re going to be looking at there and decide if that\u2019s an accretive opportunity or not? Is it simply NAV or something else? Bill Thomas : Michael, as we stated on free cash flow, our priorities are to target \u2013 to be able to be in a position to target a stronger dividend increase. And we\u2019ve been doing it in historical past, which has been 19%. And then we certainly have outlined a very strong debt reduction, as Tim talked about earlier, and we\u2019ve got about $2.65 billion in the next three years to \u2013 we want to reduce that. And so our priority to maintain a strong balance sheet is \u2013 has put us in a position, where we have the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities down the road in the future, such as high-return, low-cost property additions, particularly things that could go in conjunction with these new plays that we\u2019re talking about. And it puts us in a position to consider potential share buyback. So share buybacks could be an option, when our senior management and our Board indentify a value-accretive opportunity in the future. So we continuously consider all the options what is in the best interest of the shareholder. And our primary focus is on creating the most value for shareholders in the future. So we\u2019ll continually consider on a quarterly basis free cash flow availability and what is the best allocation of capital to create the most value. Michael Scialla : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Douglas Leggate : Yes. Thank you, and good afternoon, everybody, or good morning, I should say. I\u2019m actually in Europe right now, so sorry about that, Bill. Bill, a bit of a philosophical question, if I may, and it really relates to your comments about being one of the best companies to compete with the S&P. No question, you guys have knocked it out of the park against the E&P sector. But the big difference between the focus on returns and competitive drills is that, the S&P obviously has been dramatically better than the E&P sector over the period that you focus on premium locations. The big difference being that they payout a lot more of their cash flow for those competitive growth companies, think biotech, think technology. So if you\u2019re really talking about \u2013 what do you feel \u2013 what do you think about that your relative performance to the S&P obviously isn\u2019t delivering that with the current strategy? What makes you think you will do so in the future? Bill Thomas : Yes, Doug. Certainly, you\u2019ve identified two of the key things is a return on capital employed. We think we can be competitive even through the commodity cycles with double-digit and we believe on growth that we can be competitive with any sector through the commodity cycle. And as we work on lowering the cost basis of the company and our capital efficiency, we will target free cash flow. And as we continue to generate free cash flow and get better at doing that, that allows us to return more cash to the shareholders. Certainly, first, we picked through dividend. We\u2019ve already outlined our debt reduction. And then down the road, it comes to where we have situations where we can have accretive value through share purchases, we\u2019ll consider that too. So we\u2019re committed to making the company better in every means. And we certainly believe that our culture and our business model has the ability to compete with any company in any business. Douglas Leggate : No, I understand the philosophy. I\u2019m just trying to understand what \u2013 how it changes as it relates to the comment about the relative performance story within the broader market when your cash distributions are so much lower. I guess, that\u2019s what I was getting at. But my follow-up really, if I may, is also kind of a high-level question and it really is related to the same thing, because we\u2019re all wrestling with this. Let\u2019s be honest now for the stock price performance over last several years, and it really is the issue of that. The one thing that\u2019s different obviously with oil and gas is, you\u2019re dealing with a commodity and the volatility of that commodity. You guys are a very large company. On the high-end of your prior target range, 25% at $60 oil, your growth in oil is 10% of global demand growth. And we know the growth isn\u2019t rare, but growth with cash returns is. So I\u2019m just, again, trying to reconcile why not grow at a slower rate and step up the cash distribution? Because you can\u2019t control the oil price. And if you can grow at that rate and the rest of the industry following six, obviously we\u2019ve got a problem with the commodity. So I\u2019m just wondering how you address that circular volatility, and I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks. Bill Thomas : Well, Doug, as \u2013 if you consider the metrics that and the value that we\u2019re creating by drilling possibly 700 wells this year. As I stated in the opening call, the net present value \u2013 discounted net present value is about $6 million per well. So our drilling program this year is creating more than $4 billion of value, that\u2019s a significant thing. And so you can obviously \u2013 when you\u2019re reinvesting its super high rates of return and creating that much value per well, that is an exceptionally good. There\u2019s not many businesses and in any business that can create that kind of value. And then second of all, we truly believe that we can be among the low-cost producers in the energy market. So that gives us a competitive advantage. We have a lead we believe versus our competitors in cost and being the low-cost producer and we also have the culture to get better faster than most of our competitors. So we have a long-term sustainable business model. And our goal is to create tremendous value and be able to \u2013 through growth and returns and be able to do that sustainably for a long period of time. Douglas Leggate : I agree with that. I'm going to close that there, Bill. But just with \u2013 if there's any sort of comment, though, that has been your strategy for four years. And if you really believe that much value is being dislocated from your share price, which is flat, why not go ahead and buy back your stock? And that\u2019s really all I\u2019m saying is that, the value creation isn\u2019t being recognized at the market, then that means something has to change? Thanks so much. Bill Thomas : Thank you. Again, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate what\u2019s best for the shareholders on a quarterly basis and make the appropriate decisions going forward. Operator : The next question will be from Paul Sankey of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Paul Sankey : Good morning, everyone. I mean in the uncomfortable position of supporting the previous couple of questions. They were actually very much in line with what I was going to ask about, particularly the accretion definition, which I know is always difficult. But also the balance between growth and returns relative to the stock price performance. One further one I would just add is, do you have a comment on motion for your premium inventory life, which seems to be steadily rising? I wondered if there was a point at which there was no need to raise it anymore now than you\u2019re getting deal for 13 years? Thanks. Bill Thomas : Paul, this is Bill again. We \u2013 we\u2019re not focused on this the size of it. We\u2019re really focused on the quality of it. And that\u2019s why, of course, we\u2019re \u2013 as we talked about, that\u2019s not we\u2019re working on new these new play concepts. And so we believe that our inventory, even the lower tier part of our inventory is probably comparable, maybe even better than much of the inventory that\u2019s been drilled by the U.S. And that has a lot of value in the future. So we\u2019ll continue to work on getting value for that. We\u2019ve sold quite a bit of property over the last few years, I think, over $6 billion over the last five years or so. So we\u2019ll continue working on tearing off the lower-quality and adding on to the higher-quality and improving the overall metrics of our inventory. Paul Sankey : Yes. Again, it\u2019s \u2013 further to that firstly, if there is a potential to increase your definition of premium inventory and so accrete returns through higher hurdle rate, even I accept that your hurdle rate is impressive. But as you\u2019re constantly growing, potentially, you could skew towards more returns of a growth through that? And secondly, I completely hear what you\u2019re saying about disposals, but you do seem to becoming more and more spread in more and more areas, potentially the \u2013 potential for increased disposals, I guess, would be an additional logical continuation of that strategy? Thanks. Bill Thomas : Yes That\u2019s correct, Paul. I think we\u2019re a bit more decentralized than most other companies. And that decentralized structure is a huge advantage in the company, because we can execute on each one of these plays with a very dedicated, strong group of people that can learn quickly and apply the technologies and the learnings that we\u2019re getting across the company and we share those. And so we can, with our scale, with our ability to share data and learnings, we can execute each one of those plays at a very efficient manner. And when you have multiple plays, you can take each play slower. So that you can take advantage of the money, because you don\u2019t have to go so fast on any of them and it makes all your plays better. So \u2013 and it give you a very stable high-return and high-growth portfolio to continue to build the company on. Paul Sankey : Sure. Okay, thanks. I mean, the problem does remain that the stock is not competing with the S&P in the way that you wanted to, I think, that\u2019s what we\u2019re driving at? Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Thomas for his closing remarks. Bill Thomas : In closing, EOG\u2019s results in 2018 were the best in company history due to the excellent work by everyone in EOG. We\u2019re headed into 2019 with tremendous momentum, so we\u2019re very excited about the year. EOG has never been in better shape. We are pleased, but not satisfied, so we fully expect to continue to get better. Our goal is to be one of the top performers in the S&P 500 with double-digit returns and double-digit growth through commodity cycles and deliver significant long-term shareholder value. Thanks for your support and thanks for listening. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir. Tim Driggers : Thank you. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing first quarter 2019 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release in EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions as well as reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and they are accompanying investor presentation slides may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our earnings release issued yesterday. Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, Chief Operating Officer; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Ezra Yacob, EVP Exploration and Production; and David Streit, VP, Investor and Public Relations. Here\u2019s Bill Thomas. Bill Thomas : Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. EOG's goal is clear and simple, be one of the best companies across all sectors in the S&P 500 by realizing double-digit returns and double-digit organic growth through the commodity cycles. Our stellar first quarter performance demonstrates that we are lowering the cost of oil required to achieve that goal. We're confident in our ability to continue to decouple our performance from the commodity price cycles and that our sustainable business model will consistently deliver excellent results in the future. As a result, the Board of Directors approved a 31% increase to our dividend rate. The annualized dividend is now $1.15 per share and represents the largest single dollar increase in EOG's history. This is a tremendous vote of confidence in EOG's future and demonstrates a strong commitment to capital discipline and returning cash to shareholders through the dividend. Our premium combination of high returns and organic growth is evident in every area of the company with 2019 shaping up to be one of the best operating performances in the company history. Well costs and operating costs are falling, and well productivity is strong. EOG is growing all volumes at lower cost per barrel than ever before. We are excited about 2019 and the outstanding operational and the financial results we are delivering. Some of the highlights this quarter include year-over-year oil growth of 20%, exiting the high-end of our crude oil production target, capital expenditure below the low end of expectations, strong year-over-year lease operating and transportation per unit cost reductions, additional reductions and completed well costs. And we secured significant crude oil export capacity increasing our ability to receive the best prices. EOG continues to improve unit costs, capital efficiency and profitability. In fact, we made the same amount of net income compared to the first quarter of last year with significantly lower oil prices, a remarkable achievement demonstrating EOG's resiliency to low oil prices and the company's sustainable ability to continuously improve. In addition to great results this year, we're excited about the steps we're taking to improve future results due our organic exploration of new high-quality plays. Our exploration focus in 15 years of experience drilling horizontal oil wells has generated mountains of proprietary data that gives us an edge in identifying new plays. We have 13 years of premium oil inventory. So we are squarely focused on further improving the quality of our inventory rather than just adding more quantity. Adding a low-cost organic inventory with better [rock] [ph] will enable the company to grow oil at lower costs and higher margins for years to come. At EOG, we have an unwavering commitment to creating shareholder value through our long-standing business model, exploration-driven organic growth, operational excellence, technical leadership all underpinned by a distinctive culture. Our decentralized structure and focus on returns combined with our entrepreneurial, pleased but never satisfied mindset, continues to produce outstanding result today, and is set to produce sustainable improvements in the future. EOG has never been in better shape. And the company has never had a brighter future. Next up is Billy to review our first quarter operational performance and outlook for the remainder of 2019. Billy Helms : Thank you, Bill. Before I go into the quarter results, I want to be clear on this point. We will not increase CapEx. We remain confident in our 2019 plan, and activity will be adjusted throughout the year to achieve our production and capital objectives. Now, onto the first quarter, our results reflect our tremendous efficiency gains that were beginning to emerge late last year and materialized more fully early this year. We delivered more oil, producing 436,000 barrels per day, exceeding our forecast. To be more specific, the wells completed at the end of last year are outperforming our forecast. And that trend has continued into the first quarter of this year. Of equal importance, we spent less capital than expected. Our capital was well below our forecast for the quarter, as we are realizing the increase in efficiencies across our operations. Unit operating cost performance was also stellar, coming in at the low end of our forecast. And in the case of lease operating expense, we were well below our forecast. It\u2019s important to note that our strong operational execution is not related to the reduction in service costs, it\u2019s driven by our relentless quest for continuous improvements and our intense focus on developing new technology. All areas of our operations contributed to EOG's first quarter execution and capital efficiency. First, our drilling teams continued to markedly improve their drilling times and performance. More importantly, the consistency of the improved performance can be seen across our entire rig fleet. This is a result of two factors. One, we made the decision to maintain the high performing drilling teams and services that are now consistently executing our internally engineered drilling program. In each of our major areas of activity, we continued to achieve new record drilling times and costs. And two, our drilling teams continued to adopt new technology processes and specialized tools that improve both drilling performance and repeatability. Ideas are developed in-house and deployed by partnering with service providers. For example, eliminating even one trip where the drill bed must be brought back to service can save up to $100,000. To capture those savings, we first analyze then design the best down hole motor to use in our bottom hole assembly and took additional step of bringing quality assurance in-house. As a result of having direct control of this equipment, we have observed a pronounced reduction in the number of trips, while also improving the rate of penetration. Together, reducing the trips and increasing the penetration rate is saving up to $400,000 per well. It\u2019s this type of innovation that helps EOG continue to deliver best-in-class drilling performance across all of our plays. Second, our completion teams are experimenting with new design advancements that combine both technique and the use of new diverting agents. This proprietary formula is noticeably improving well performance, and equally important reducing completion costs. Well performance in these low permeability reservoirs improves due to enhanced fracture complexity. Completion costs are reduced due to lower material costs, and faster execution allows us to complete more lateral feet per day. The result is a solid improvement in our capital efficiency. Further testing and production time will yield more fulsome data and place specific recipes for each of our operating areas. But suffice to say that the early results are encouraging. Finally, investments in strategic water, oil and gas infrastructure along with gathering partnerships allow us to leverage our scale in our core operating areas and are having a long-term sustainable impact on our operating costs, particularly lease operating expenses. We continue to evaluate additional high return, long-term impact opportunities to further reduce costs. In summary, we've had a great start to 2019. Our operational teams are on track to deliver on our improved capital efficiency goals. Average well costs across our portfolio are down about 2.5%, halfway toward our 5% goal for the year. We've made significant progress towards our goal to reduce per barrel finding costs. These improvements will continue to drive down our DD&A rate over time, and along with unit operating costs improvements, enable EOG to achieve our return objective in low commodity price environments. Here's Lance to provide a marketing update highlighted by our recent progress to secure Gulf Coast export capacity. Lance Terveen : Thanks, Billy. EOG has established marketing agreements that provide access to crude oil export markets in Corpus Christi and Houston. Our capacity in Corpus Christi will ramp up from 100,000 barrels of oil per day in 2020 to 250,000 barrels of oil per day in 2022. We expect to sell crude oil to export markets from multiple plays, including the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basins. As we illustrate on Slide 19, EOG will control its crude volumes from the basin all the way across the dock as our agreements provides for pipeline capacity, terminal tankage, and dock access. With the options of price our crude oil further downstream, we expand our flexibility to sell products to domestic or international markets, whichever provides the highest margins. This optionality ensures strong price discovery and liquidity for EOG barrels. Our export marketing agreements are an example of our integrated marketing strategy, which is designed to achieve four objectives. First is control. Control means firm capacity of our product to the point where margins are maximized. Second is flexibility. We plan ahead to establish multiple options to deliver product to the highest net back market. Third is diversification. We take a portfolio approach knowing the optimal net back price will move around faster than we can adjust transportation agreements. Fourth is duration. We prefer shorter term contracts to avoid long-term high costs fix commitments. This strategy is reflected in advantage positioning of oil take away in the Permian Basin. EOG controls these barrels from the wellhead to the sales point. Delaware Basin barrels are transported out of basin on a fit for purpose gathering system for five pipeline interconnect points, which can transport the well anywhere from Cushing, Houston, Corpus Christi and even Midland. And we have accomplished this with limited long-term commitments and competitive transportation rates. This strategy paid off in the first quarter. Despite the volatility of oil and natural gas prices in the Permian, EOG was able to flow all of its production and realize strong prices during the quarter. In aggregate, EOG's realized U.S. oil price was $1.21 above WTI in the first quarter, and our U.S. gas price is only $0.36 below Henry Hub. This is a tremendous achievement in navigating the volatile market. Crude oil and natural gas marketing is an integral part of EOG's value creation strategy. We anticipate future infrastructure needs to protect flow assurance and diversify our marketing options so that we can maximize our price realizations, net of transportation costs. We accomplish this by working closely with our operating teams in each of our major plays and divisions to understand the potential future development plans and by keeping up both on market fundamentals of each product and marketing point. Our proven marketing strategy has helped EOG successfully navigate bottlenecks across all areas of operations, including most recently in the Permian basin. We measure the success of marketing efforts through our price realizations, which we highlight on slide number 20, as well as the transportation costs we incurred to deliver our production to market. Next up is Ken to review the Eagle Ford highlights. Ken Boedeker : Thanks Lance. The Eagle Ford remains the workhorse asset for EOG, earning high returns and delivering sustainable growth, while generating strong cash flow. EOG has been developing the Eagle Ford for about 10 years. However, less than 40% of the identified locations have been drilled. Last year Eagle Ford production grew 9%. We forecast the Eagle Ford is capable of growing, for at least 10 more years at premium rates of return, while generating significant cash flow in excess of capital expenditures each year. More importantly, we believe the capital productivity of the Eagle Ford will continue to improve in the years ahead. Sustainable cost reduction has been a key theme throughout our 10-year history developing the Eagle Ford. Even in a play that is already accumulated significant operating efficiencies, we were able to reduce drilling costs by 7%, and increase completed lateral fleet per day by over 50% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. In fact, the first quarter of 2019 was our best drilling efficiency quarter that we've ever had in the Eagle Ford on a dollar per foot basis, highlighting our culture of always getting better. On the production side, we're continuing our efforts to further optimize artificial lift and manage water production, which will help us control lease operating expenses longer term. Drilling in our Western Eagle Ford acreage continues to deliver strong premium returns, net present value, finding costs and capital efficiency. Our Western acreage will be a crucial component of long-term growth for the play, and we expect it will make up the majority of our Eagle Ford drilling program by 2021, growing from about 40% of our program in 2019. Capital efficiency in the West is caught up over time and is nearing parity with the East as illustrated on Slide 39. Compared to the East laterals in the West are longer and per foot drilling costs are lower, so productivity and economics per well are competitive. Our proprietary enhanced oil recovery process in the Eagle Ford continues to perform the technical and commercial expectations. EUR is a secondary recovery process in this play and primary development remains the main focus of our operations in 2019. The EUR footprint will be expanded after a larger portion of the play has been fully developed. The best days of the Eagle Ford are still ahead. We continue to convert non-premium inventory to premium status through sustainable cost reductions, productivity improvements and leasehold consolidation. The Eagle Ford is a strong growth asset for EOG, and we expect it to remain one for many years ahead. Now here's Ezra to discuss the Delaware basin. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Ken. In the Delaware basin, we continue to improve on operational momentum we gained last year. Retaining top-performing drilling rigs and completion crews toward the end of 2018 had an immediate impact on the first quarter. We drilled and completed 78 gross wells across six different premium targets with just 18 rigs and seven completion crews. Compared to the first quarter of 2018, we drilled and completed 42% more lateral fleet. However, we use one less rig and one less completion crew. As a result, we\u2019ve made strong progress towards our full year cost reduction goals. In addition, we reduced drilling days by 29%, transferred 99% of our water by pipe, which reduces traffic and saved $2 per barrel compared to trucking. Source more than 70% of our water through reuse and reduced total wells cost by 5%. Finally, first quarter wells are outperforming our expectations and we beat our production and financial targets for the first quarter, including capital expenditures. The result is a first quarter development program that achieved in all-in finding costs below $10 per barrel of equivalent, while earning $9 million of MPB per well, and an average 100% direct rate of return. EOG is a vast industry leading 400,000 net acre position in the core of the Delaware Basin. The rock is about one mile thick and geologically complex. Due to our 15 years of experience drilling horizontal oil wells, we have accelerated the learning curve in this basin. As a result, even though the Delaware Basin is still early in its evolution and one of our highest growth areas, this asset is already creating significant value through high return drilling, low operating expense and positive cash flow just three short years since focusing on its development. I\u2019ll now turn is over to Tim Driggers to discuss our financials and capital structure. Tim Driggers : Thanks, Ezra. EOG had strong financial performance in the first quarter. The company generated discretionary cash flow of $1.9 billion, invested $1.7 billion in capital expenditures before acquisitions, which was below the low end of our guidance and paid $128 million in dividends. This left $55 million in free cash flow. In addition, we invested $303 million in bolt-on property acquisitions located in new exploration areas. As part of our debt reduction plan, we expect to repay the $900 million bonds scheduled to mature on June 1 with cash on hand, which, as of March 31st was $1.1 billion. I\u2019m happy to report Moody\u2019s recognized EOG's growing financial strength last month upgrading EOG's credit rating to A3 with the stable outlook. To quote the Moody\u2019s press release announcing the upgrade the company stated. The upgrade of EOG's rating into the A category recognizes the company\u2019s high capital productivity, backed by operating excellence and a long life high quality asset base that will continue to underpin the strong credit profile and that a number of oil price scenarios. The A3 rating is also supported by the company\u2019s conservative financial policies. Last but not least, we announced the dividend increase of 31% in the yesterday\u2019s earnings release. The indicated annual rate is now $1.15 per share. EOG have added hedges for 150,000 barrels of oil per day at an average price of $62.50. This covers about one-third of our crude oil production over the remainder of 2019. For natural gas, we added hedges for 250,000 MMBTU per day at an average price of $2.90, which is about 20% of our U.S. natural gas production through October. We believe the decision to lock in a portion of our crude - our current crude oil and natural gas prices is prudent considering the volatility and prices and high return on investment of our capital program at these prices. I\u2019ll turn it back over to Bill for closing remarks. Bill Thomas : Thanks, Tim. I have a few highlights to leave you with. First, we are running under plan on capital and over plan on volumes, and we\u2019re not raising capital. Second, EOG has tremendous momentum across all facets of the business, drilling, completions, operating expenses, marketing and exploration. Third, we're still getting better. Along with continuous cost reduction and strong well performance, we're optimistic our low cost organic exploration efforts this year will increase the quality of our inventory even further and lower the cost of future oil production. Fourth, our export marketing agreements provide direct access to international markets and expand our ability to capture the best prices. Fifth, the dividend increase shows our confidence in our sustainable business model to deliver performance through the commodity price cycles. And finally, our sustainable business model is driven by our culture. We have an insatiable drive to continue to get better. We're confident EOG can deliver double-digit returns and double-digit growth and achieve our goal of being one of the best performing companies in the S&P500 through commodity price cycles, long into the future. Thanks for listening. And now we'll go to Q&A. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question will come from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust Robinson, Humphrey. Please go ahead. Neal Dingmann : My first question, maybe, Bill, for you. Could you all speak to your plans of -- you've done a great job of balancing growth for shareholder return. And, really, when you look at that, you've almost doubled now your dividend in the last year, while production growing about 30% here over the last year. So oil was up only about 15%. So my question would be, specifically if oil stays here or goes higher, would you stick with the 12% to 16% oil growth plans? And if so, what would you do with the potential material amount of free cash flow? Bill Thomas : First of all, I think it's really clear we said that on our first call of the year that we're not going to be shifting into a lower growth mode. And we don't have specifics on 2020 oil growth. But certainly, you can think of the company in the -- our 14% oil growth target this year is really a bit on the low end. And so we're really focused on high return oil growth. And that's the way we believe will create the most value for our shareholders on the long-term. You heard, I think from Ezra, the tremendous rates of return and the NPV we're creating on each well we're drilling. So that's the priority for us in the future. And that's way we think we're going to continue to generate the most value in the long term. Neal Dingmann : Very good. And maybe my second question would be for Billy or Ezra, could you just discuss, particularly in the Perm, your PDP decline expectations, I mean, in the prepared remarks, I think you all commented just how much better these new wells are than a year ago. So I'm just wondering is that true as far as how these wells are holding up? Or just anything you could discuss towards how you're seeing these wells after a number of months? Billy Helms : Yes, Neal. This is Billy. I think in general across all of our plays, you see that as we drill longer laterals that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to directionally higher IP 30s per well. But we see the performance hang in there longer, you see little bit lot lower decline over time. And I think that's really, if you look at the first quarter results, that's what's driving a lot of our performance, sustained improvement in all our programs. And it's a function of just the quality of the wells, the better execution across the wells and the focus of the teams. Ezra, you want to add anything or? Ezra Yacob : I'll just highlight too that the team's done a great job in the Permian in the last year really learning a lot about the reservoir, figuring out across our acreage position, which targets need to be co-developed together, the spacing both horizontally and vertically. And when you combine that increase in well productivity with our excellent operational execution, that's why you're seeing the lower finding cost I discussed in the opening remarks and the higher capital efficiency, which we've great success, is going to continue throughout the year. Operator : The next question will be from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate : So I would just like to touch on the acquisition capital and, obviously you're not going to tell us where you're acquiring, I guess. But some ideas to what we can expect that plays to look like going forward was -- first quarter very much one off or should we expect some kind of sustainable level of acquisition spending as we go forward? Bill Thomas : Doug, your question, because it's difficult to hear you, it was a little bit garbled. So could you be a little bit more clear there? Doug Leggate : I apologize. I'm on my cell phone. I'd be coming in okay now Bill. Bill Thomas : Yes, go ahead. Doug Leggate : So my question was on the level of acquisition capital going forward. Was first quarter very much a one-off or should we expect acquisition capital to be something of a repeating pattern as we go forward for a period? Bill Thomas : Okay. Thank you. That was better. Yes, we, as you know the company, we're not really focused on corporate M&As. But we do occasionally look at bolt-on type acquisitions and they're focused primarily in our exploration plays. And these acquisitions are very low cost and very, very high potential, obviously, or we wouldn't be interested in doing them. And they're kind of one-offs. And so it's not something you're going to see repeatedly over every quarter. And so I'm not saying we're not going to do another one this year or not. We don't have any plans at this point to do anymore. But they're really opportunistic drilling, opportunistic given and certainly our focus on very, very high return and low cost drilling potential. Doug Leggate : I appreciate the answer. Hopefully you can still hear me. My follow-up is just a quick one. Obviously, really pleased to see the dividend increase, I'm sure a lot of people would applaud that. But I'm curious, what do you think the right payout ratio as for an E&P company in other words, as you get to where your longer-term plans go, what do you think that right percentage of your operating cash flow should be being returned to shareholders? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. Bill Thomas : Well, certainly, I think that's operator or company dependent, I don't think there's any one answer for any company. For EOG, specifically we\u2019re generating super high, fantastic returns on every dollar we spend. And so we believe our allocation on reinvesting in very, very high rate premium drilling is a number one priority. We also strongly believe as we\u2019ve demonstrated this quarter in strong, sustainable dividend growth. And we think that\u2019s the best way to get cash back to shareholders. And then, we're also very focused on having a pristine balance sheet. And we think that\u2019s just a fundamental good business practice. And it gives us an enormous advantage, especially for counter cyclic opportunities in the future. So that\u2019s kind of our allocation. And I think that's very unique to EOG's business model. And I think it\u2019s very sustainable for us. Operator : The next question will be from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead. Charles Meade : I have a question about your CapEx just year-over-year. If you look at the way you guys have had posted 1Q, and your guidance for 2Q, you have a first half is heavier than the back half. And we saw that same pattern in 2018. So my question is that a feature or manifestation of your planning process? Or was that more just a coincidence with the way that 2019, 2018 had shaken out? Billy Helms : Yes, Charles. This is Billy Helms. So yes, our first quarter CapEx was about 27% of our total annual budget. And in the first half, you can look at our guidance will be slightly more weighted towards the first half than we are in the second half. And we have confidence that we\u2019ll be able to meet our capital on production goals for the year. So I expect as we go through the year, you\u2019ll see us adjust our schedule, probably slight reduction in the second half. But also it\u2019s not just related to the cadence of rigs. We also have infrastructure spend and lease hold spend that happens in a quarter. So I think we\u2019re very - what I would say is we\u2019re very confident. We\u2019ll be able to make our production goal and stay within our CapEx that we\u2019ve outlined. And it\u2019s really kind of early to provide guidance for how we\u2019ll ratio that down through the year. And we have a lot of flexibility operating multiple basins. So it will fluctuate as we go through the year. Charles Meade : And then one, I guess kind of more targeted question on the Delaware Basin position. I noticed that the - your Bone Springs laterals are significantly shorter. I think its 5,500 lateral feet versus really 7,500 or 7,800 on other zones in that same basin. Can you elaborate a little bit on what maybe going on there? Is it about the lease configuration where you\u2019re developing those Bone Springs? Or was a more decision about the way you need to stimulate that formation? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Charles, this is Ezra. That\u2019s a great question. Really, you picked up on there in the lateral half of your question, it really just comes down the lease configuration where shape of our drilling units are. I think in general, as you\u2019ve seen, as we look back at our well results quarter-over-quarter, we\u2019re trying to get longer with our laterals across all of our plays. And the reason for that is that simply the cost per foot is so much less that are really increases the capital efficiency. And so I'd look in the future to see that Bone Spring getting longer as well. Operator : The next question will be from Tim Rezvan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Tim Rezvan : Eagle Ford inventory depth remains a focus for investors. And I noted pretty interesting comments in the release about high grading the residual 4,900 non premium locations. Is this just a matter of sort of cheaper well costs, longer laterals and the new completions? Or is it really more toward from a delineation or aspiration point of view? And kind of how high is getting that number up? How high is that on your priority list this year? Ken Boedeker : Yes, Tim, this is Ken. As far as converting those non premium locations to premium, we look at that several ways, we look at that, we're trying to reduce the well costs and improve the productivity of the wells. So we're always looking at being able to do that and looking at all the different areas. We're actually doing several different packages and tests to improve our conversion of non-premium to premium throughout the year and throughout our acreage position. So we have a significant number of those laterals to drill this year and we have a significant number to convert in the future. We're also drilling a lot longer laterals as we go towards the West. And that'll help convert some of those non premium wells to premium. Tim Rezvan : Okay. So you expect to see that number, maybe grand higher throughout the year? Ken Boedeker : That's what we're working towards. Tim Rezvan : Then my follow-up, your proxy came out in March, and it's stated that less than 90% of wells drilled in 2018 qualified as premium. I was hoping to better understand what that means. Does that mean that well level returns didn't hit threshold? Or does it mean that there was more exploratory drilling in that year? And just thinking about maybe how we should think about that in 2019 given the exploratory focus? Thanks. Bill Thomas : Yes, Tim, it means that a few of the wells that we drilled, and there is a very few in the total package of wells we drilled last year were either step-out wells or exploration wells in areas where we did -- maybe didn't have the infrastructure in place or we're on the learning curve in some of the spacing tests didn't quite make the 30% after tax rate return at $40 flat. It doesn't mean those wells didn\u2019t or weren't really strong economics. Those wells are fantastic economics, probably better than the -- probably are non premium. Those are better than the average for the whole industry on returns. But it was just a very few of those. And that's what we have. Tim Rezvan : And just to push, do you have a number on that? Is that 11% or is it kind of higher number? Bill Thomas : I\u2019m sorry. Off the top of my head, I don't have the number. Operator : The next question will be from Paul Grigel of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Paul Grigel : In the release you discussed testing additional targets in the Woodford. Could you elaborate on what you would be seeing there? And what timeframe we could see results from that portion of the program? Ken Boedeker : Yes, this is Ken. We're continuing to test other areas in the Woodford. As we get additional information on that and anything material we\u2019ll release to you guys. I would like to make a point we've really made great strides in the operational efficiency in that. In the Woodford play this year, we've almost dropped our drilling costs down and met our target for the year. So we do still plan to complete about 30 wells in the area this year, and we're real pleased with the progress that we've made. Paul Grigel : Okay. And then earlier in the call there was a comment made as the Eagle Ford program matures and there's more development opportunities, the expansion to EOR program will occur. Could you elaborate on -- is that by area? Is that geological testing? Is that simply you just need to make sure that the wells are matured in the pit at certain level? Just trying to understand when the EOR program could see expansion throughout the Eagle Ford? Ken Boedeker : This is Ken again. We'll expand the EOR as we really finish up with our primary development in those areas. We'll expand that in the areas that make sense based on some of the results that we've seen already with the EOR program. So it's really a matter of finishing up primary development in a lot of those areas. Paul Grigel : Is that a certain number of years after initial development or just trying to understand when primary development is considered to be finished? Ken Boedeker : I would guess, I would classify primary development as finished when we quit drilling wells in those areas and we can begin the EOR process. Operator : The next question will be from Leo Mariani of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Leo Mariani : Hey guys, just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the dividend increase here. Obviously, as you pointed out very material increase for EOG, why do you get a sense is to whether or not you guys might be seeking a yield that's a little closer to kind of the 2% that the S&P 500 has you know out there? And then additionally, just with respect to the dividend, is there some kind of price level, for example, on the oil side that you guys may stress test that too? Or for example, you say hey, at $45, we need to be confident that we can manage that and still target our production growth? Just any color you had around that will be helpful. Bill Thomas : Leo, yes, this is Bill. Yes, certainly the dividend increase is evaluated every quarter. Obviously, the macro view of oil prices and our ability to sustain the dividend is a very important thing. We've never cut the dividend ever in the history of EOG, and we don't ever want to do that. So when we make a commitment on the dividend, we make a commitment. And our commitment, the last two years has been, as we stated, we wanted to increase the dividend faster than our 19% historical average. So the last two years, we've increased to 31%. And so our focus on the future is to continue to do that. We will give a specific number, but certainly we want to have very strong dividend growth for a long number of years. And that's a commitment that we're making to our shareholders. Leo Mariani : And I just wanted to jump over to the exploration front. I guess, clearly you guys made a couple of bolt-on acquisitions in the first quarter, and I hope that bolstering that effort. But I certainly sensed a fair bit of excitement around the exploration effort this year from your comments. I'm supposing that you're not going to be ready to share results. But just based on sort of what you're seeing out there, can you qualitatively indicate whether or not you think some of this is working, and might we get some announcements here in 2019 from EOG on that front? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Leo, this is Ezra. Thanks for the question. As we discussed earlier in the year and in the opening comments like you suggested, we\u2019re pretty excited about the exploration opportunities. We're really focused on applying our drilling and completions techniques to higher quality unconventional reservoirs. And what really drives our process of having a multi-basin dataset that allows us to compare contrast different reservoir characteristics of each of the sweet spots in the established plays that we\u2019re in. And we apply that to new ideas and areas. As Bill highlighted, we\u2019re not just interested in adding quantity, but really increasing the quality of our premium inventory. And that really should continue to reduce our finding costs, lower our DDNA, and help achieve our long-term goals of double-digit growth and returns. And when we have a little more insight and color, something little more material, we\u2019ll certainly update you guys. Leo Mariani : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess could have noticed the marketing sort of arrangement for the export capacity that you folks signed up here. I just wanted to get a sense has EOG already been exporting oil barrels internationally at this point? And it certainly seems that there is a potential big increase coming over the next couple of years. Just wanted to get a sense of whether or not you've already got some relationships there to international buyers out there that you\u2019re hoping to expand? Lance Terveen : Yes, Leo, good morning. This is Lance. So thanks for the question. Yes, when you think about the existing business, I mean we\u2019ve been very active in Houston for quite some. I mean Houston is really kind of been our warehouses, especially since 2012 with a lot of our pipeline capacity that comes into the Houston market. But since the export bans unlisted, we\u2019ve been actively engage there. We\u2019ve got a tank position is there as well. So we\u2019ve been making spot sales for quite some time, especially looking in the last year too. So we\u2019ve been active on that front. And so we\u2019re very excited too about our new capacity that's going to be starting up moving into next year. Really when you think about and you look at the balances in the U.S., you look at supply growth, you look at imports -- exports are going to be here the same. And we really want to have a very large position there. And having that control at the dock, we feel that just going to give us a lot of price discovery. But again it\u2019s about portfolio approach. I mean we want to protect those realizations. And so moving into the next year and you look - we feel we\u2019re going to be very well positioned with our -- its just unique that we\u2019re going to have our Permian, and also our Eagle Ford that we\u2019re going to be able to show across the dock. So we feel we\u2019re very unique relative to when you look at the producer group on the different quality. So we\u2019re going to be able to show to the domestic market, but then also our international customers too. Operator : The next question will be from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Campbell : I just wanted to touch basic on the various technological efforts there analysis all the stuff you\u2019re doing. You called it up again. And it sounded like it was, perhaps getting even more and more into the daily field operations. So I was wondering if you just give us a little bit color on that? Thank you. Billy Helms : Yes. Jeff, this is Billy Helms. I can add a little bit of color to that. I think part of that goes down to our very culture of the company, we\u2019re always trying to get better of what we do. And the way we do that as we look at all the details, and we gather lots and lots of data and we\u2019ve had these systems in place for some time. And then, the key part of that is delivering that data back to our team, so they can exercise good decisions on how to improve our operations and the way we just do our business in all aspects. And we're seeing that manifest itself on the drilling highlights that we offer today as well as the completion highlight improvements that we\u2019re seeing. So on the drilling side we\u2019re monitoring the daily rate of penetration on all of our drilling rigs, and making sure our drilling times are not just keeping up with what we're doing, but how do we continue to get better. And so the results we're seeing today are direct reflection, our ability to gather the data and transport that back and analyze it and deliver it to the field and have the guys making the decisions. So it is part of our culture, real time returns focused decision making. Jeffrey Campbell : So for example, the thing that you talked about earlier today, where you're coming up with new completion methods that are using diverters more effectively and you're cutting costs accordingly. These kind of efforts are emanating from all this data analysis that you just talked about? Billy Helms : Absolutely. And we're using -- more importantly, and we're using that data real time. So we're actually making decisions based on the pressure rates -- pressures and rates we're seeing on the wells we're not only fracking, but the offset wells to make decisions about how to implement our formula. And so that's why the formula is not a cookie cutter formula you can apply everywhere, its tailored, its specifically designed by each well, by each zone, depending on the target zone and their offsets. It takes an integral approach to be able to analyze the data real time and make the right decisions. Jeffrey Campbell : Okay. And if I could just ask a quick follow up to that. This is -- when we're thinking about it, is this part of the 5% goal to get costs down? Or is that 5% goal more based on logistics and contracting and that sort of thing? Bill Thomas : No. That's a good question, Tim. I would add to that that really none of the cost savings we're seeing today are a factor of service cost reductions. It is strictly improving efficiencies, lowering our costs by doing things better as well as making better wells. So we're seeing the double effect reducing costs, improving well performance. And it's all directly related to our ability to analyze -- collect the data and analyze it real time. Operator : The next question will be from Jeanine Wai of Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeanine Wai : My question is on sand. A sand provider recently commented that some E&Ps are switching back to northern white from local sand due to crushing reasons, which I guess there could be production and cost implications through E&Ps. And I know EOG does a lot of its own testing, and I believe you are an early mover in this area. So you probably have more data than anyone on this. Can you discuss your thoughts on kind of the treatment commentary and how much exposure you have to local sand? Any basins specifically you have would be really helpful too? Bill Thomas : Yes, Jeanine, this is Bill. Certainly, we got a tremendous -- we got 20 years of history in horizontal shale plays. And we use every kind of sand pop-up material that's been available over the years. Currently, we're focused on using local sand, certainly in the Permian. That\u2019s a big cost saver for us, and certainly the industry too. So we're going to continue to do that. And we're also, I think shifting to local sand in the other play, such as Eagle Ford, and many of the Rocky place, and in Oklahoma too. So that's the direction that we're focused in. And along with a diversion material, we're making significantly better wells and lower cost wells. We do have our own testing facilities. We've been engaged in capturing sand in multiple sources. And we screen it and test it. And we're very confident at the sand we use in every play. It's kind of tailor fit for each play. We're very confident that the compressive strengths and the quality of sand that we use in each play is the right mix for long-term well performance. Jeanine Wai : Okay. I think the commentary that's kind of chain leading around, I think maybe the Eagle Ford and the Midcon outside of the Permian. And so you do use local sand in those areas as well and you're satisfied? Bill Thomas : Yes. We're satisfied. Operator : The next question will be from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Singer : One of the debates out there is whether for EOG, but also for industry is whether the best of the inventory infield is drilled from either a productivity perspective or rate of return perspective. And I think for EOG, you're more specifically pushing back on this point with the comparison of the Eagle Ford East versus West area. I was wondering if you could touch on two other areas. The first is the Permian, and your outlook for the ability of efficiency and productivity gains from here to overcome movement from core to less core over time. And the second is exploration. I think there was a comment earlier that you expect your exploration efforts will lower the cost of future oil production. What has given you confidence that that is the case if it is truly exploratory? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Brian, thank you for the question. This is Ezra. Let me start with the back half of that question first on the exploration side. And what we're excited about on our exploration opportunities is we feel like we've identified multiple opportunities where we have an opportunity to apply some of the data and the techniques that we've been learning on the Eagle Ford, the Woodford, the Permian and the Powder. We can take some of these techniques and apply them to basically higher quality reservoir. That's still should be considered unconventional by nature. And we think that well productivity should be on par with some of our best wells with shallower decline, basically due to the reservoir quality. The other important thing, obviously is that you've touched on is being a first mover in these basins and being able to capture the sweet spots of each of these plays. If I transition now, and sorry, I did this in reverse order, but if I go to the Permian, for example, I think the way to think about the Permian and one reason we spent the time highlighting the progress that we've made in the Eagle Ford is that every year one of the benefits of working in multiple basins is yet to combine datasets from multiple basins. And those learnings, as you roll them in and integrate them into the front end of both your geologic models, your drilling and your completions techniques, that's what allows us to improve some of what today might be considered a non-core area and really improve those well productivity results and continue to drive down our costs to increase the returns of those areas. So the best example I would say for the Permian is really looking back at that Eagle Ford, example, and how we've taken our Western Eagle Ford results today, and really improve them to a point where they are above and beyond what we're doing in the Eastern Eagle Ford just a few years ago. Brian Singer : And then my follow-up is with regards to the Powder River Basin. You highlighted that made some progress on the infrastructure front. Can you add some more color there, particularly in how big you're sizing that infrastructure, and how significant you think production to be, especially given the competitive profitability you\u2019ve highlighted at least as it relates to that Niobrara and Mowry zones on your Slide 41. The turnover wasn\u2019t there maybe that would be another point to touch on. Billy Helms : Yes, Brian. This is Billy Helms. Yes, the first quarter we really tested more Turner and apartment zones, particularly. And as we build out infrastructure for the bigger development, it\u2019s, I think our infrastructure build will be -- build out in segments to keep pace where there are plans for drilling in that year\u2019s program. We\u2019re not going to get out ahead and build infrastructure this made for a longer-term drilling program just because of the capital efficiency if that erodes. So the size though the scale of the infrastructure will be able to handle, certainly even the plan that we have in place for those areas. So we\u2019ll be adequately sized, but it\u2019ll be scheduled and pace that keeps up with the current drilling plans for that period. So we got off to a slow start really in the Powder, really due to weather, we plan to ramp up activity as we go through the year. And we\u2019re still very excited about the initial results we\u2019re seeing from the Mowry and Niobrara tests. And as get more data on those, certainly we\u2019ll provide more color there. But we\u2019re still excited about the Powder opportunities we see in front of us. Operator : The next question will be from Ryan Todd of Simmons Energy. Please go ahead. Ryan Todd : Maybe a couple of follow-ups and some other things. And I appreciate the clarity you have given on the Eagle Ford. And if we look at the -- on the improvement that you\u2019re seeing out to the West, as we look at the type curve that you carry in the Eagle Ford, it\u2019s got 5,300 foot lateral lengths with the concerned level of productivity there. The lateral there feels like it's clearly trending higher. Is it safe to say that as the lateral lengths increases? And as the West is improved, is that type curve probably conservative relative to what we should expect to see going forward? Kenneth Boedeker : Yes, Ryan. This is Ken, again. We are really pleased with the way the wells have been reacting out there and our well productivity is meeting the expectations. We do see the performance variations across the 120 mile long acreage position. And as we extend our - as we extend the laterals in the West, we'll be seeing well productivity increase, well rates and capital efficiency increase out there as well as reducing finding costs. Ryan Todd : And then maybe a follow-up on some of the acquisition activity and exploration versus your core basins, your - you\u2019ve obviously been spending money picking up acreage in some of your core basins you\u2019re really excited about. And is this -- do you still see opportunities to add the positions in your core areas of operations? Or is the valuation outside of those basins just far more compelling at this point? Bill Thomas : Ryan, this is Bill. Certainly, we have a very decentralized exploration effort. All seven of our domestic divisions have very strong exploration staff. So we\u2019re working, literally every basin, in the U.S., probably not a well being drilled. We don\u2019t know something about. And so, we\u2019re leasing in multiple plays this year at very low cost. And we believe the prospects that we're leasing on have premium economic potential due to the rock quality as Ezra talked about. And so, some of them are in basins that have had a lot of historical production, some of them are in places where there's not really much historic production at all. But they're all very high quality. And the size of the prospects we're working on, we use an example, couple of years ago, we talked about the Woodford oil play we introduced. That's about 200 million barrels of net EOG. That's kind of on the small size. So we're not looking for things smaller than that. But 200 million barrels, net to a company, discovery of that top anywhere in the world is very significant. So, last year, we announced two new plays in the Powder River Basin that totaled 1.9 billion barrels. So that's a very large one. So that's a good way to put the brackets on the size of them. But the good thing is, as Ezra talked about, we believe we can continue, and it'll organically generate significant prospects potential in the future. And added at very, very low cost, much, much lower costs than doing M&As. And so when we do these bolt-on acquisitions, there are large amounts of acreage are very, very low cost, and very, very high potential in our mind. And so we've been generating premium inventory twice as fast as we've been drilling it. And the quality of our inventory is going up at the same time. So some of the previous questions are based on, is EOG's inventory quality declining? And I can tell you-- we can tell you with absolute confidence that we believe our inventory quality will continue to improve. So the quality is going up. And we're not having any problem replacing at much faster than we\u2019re drilling it. Operator : The next question will be from Arun Jayram of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Arun Jayram : I wanted to see if you could elaborate on your comments on 2020. I know you don't have an official growth target for 2020. But your comments this morning seem to indicate your confidence that the company could grow the oil production, call it, greater than 14%. And I just wonder maybe qualitatively, what would drive you to have that level of confidence because it would be off of a larger base of production this year? Bill Thomas : Yes, Arun. We have that confidence because, I think of the culture of the company and the structure of the company and our ability to continue to add new plays to the system. We have a chart in our IR deck, I believe, it's on Page 11. That shows EOG's existing plays and their maturity phase. So most of the things that we're doing right now still have a lot of growth opportunity. And we're adding additional premium locations in each one of those plays. So that's a big source of new potential. And then, we're working on all these emerging plays. And as they come into the development mode, that will keep shifting more and more activity and inventory into the growth mode of the company. And the growth mode for each one of these plays are not a few years, they're multi years, 10 plus, 15 years growth mode for each one of these plays. And then the structure of our company, because it's decentralized, we can execute on the large number of multiple plays at the same time with a lot of discipline. So we have very expert strong staff in seven different operating divisions. So we can truly execute in multiple basins and continue to reduce costs, improve technology, be very entrepreneurial and act quickly and make really quick, crisp, good high rate of return decisions on each one of the plays at the same time. So the company has got a tremendous ability to continue our high return growth profile for a very, very long time. And I think that's quite unique in the industry. Arun Jayram : And just one question in terms of the agreements they are in place to expand your export capacity from 100,000 barrels to 250,000. For those barrels that you are able to even with that capacity, how should we think about the uplift relative to WTI from those types of barrels? One of your peers has highlighted maybe the ability to get in 60% of the Brent TI spread, let's call $3 in transportation. I was wondering if there's maybe a formula, anyway we could think about the uplift that you get on those barrels? Bill Thomas : We won't go into the detail on what we may or may not speculate on what we think the uplift. The most important thing right is it\u2019s a portfolio approach to us. When we have the diversification, we're going to have the capability there to sell domestically. So if that's a higher realized net back for us, then we can sell them domestically. And as you think about our export capacity, it\u2019s capacity that we can optimize. So again, like if you if you look back over time, you look at our experience, our goal is to maintain our price realizations, and being purely in price realizations. So we feel that dock capacity that we have there just positions us that we have agreements in place that we can transact very quickly and we can make sales into the spot business, and we can keep it on the international index like the Brent indices or we can keep it at the local markets. But we can take advantage of where the pricing leads us, and we can move very quickly. That's the way you probably need to think about that from our standpoint, which is we can move quickly and we have the capacity. And we can also -- we can meet that capacity with the Permian and also the Delaware. I think that's also very unique. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Thomas for his closing remarks. Bill Thomas : In closing, we first want to say thank you to the tremendous work by everyone at EOG. The company is starting 2019 with our best operational performance in company history. Costs are coming down and allow us -- allowing us to deliver more oil for less money than ever before. The best part of EOG's culture is that we're not through getting better. We're excited about where we are, but we're even more excited about our future. Thanks for listening. And thanks for your support. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines.",

Here\u2019s Bill Thomas. Bill Thomas : Thanks Tim and good morning everyone. EOG does not need high oil prices to create significant value for our shareholders. During the second quarter, despite a 12% decline in WTI oil prices, EOG generated more than $350 million of free cash flow, lowered our long term debt by $900 million and paid a substantially larger dividend than last year, all while organically growing U.S. oil production by 20%. The EOG culture consistently making improvements throughout the company year-after-year has propelled EOG to compete financially with the very best in the S&P500, all with oil prices averaging below $60 per barrel.  We are now capable of delivering double digit return on capital employed, and double digit growth while generating substantial free cash flow through the commodity price cycles. Our commitment to strong free cash flow is enabling us to rapidly grow the dividend. We've increased the dividend 72% in the last two years and our ambition is to target a yield that is competitive in the S&P500, which stands around 2%.  EOG never stops improving. We are one of the lowest cost producers in the global oil market and we continue to lower the cost of our business. In fact we have strong visibility and high confidence in our ability to lower our costs, so that by 2022 we can earn at least 10% return on capital employed at oil prices below $50 per barrel.  Our first half results confirm that EOG is stronger than ever, and we are delivering a banner year in operational performance. For two quarters in a row we delivered more oil for less capital. With efficiency gains and new technology, we are achieving strong capital and operating cost reductions, while at the same time delivering excellent well performance. In addition, the company is leasing anchorage and testing new geologic plate concepts that we believe could lower our decline rate and continue to reduce our costs to produce oil.  At EOG we have always believed in being a good corporate citizen goes hand-in-hand with delivering a long term value for shareholders. The same spirit of innovation that drives our excellence in operations is aimed at ensuring the business is sustainable in the long run. We are excited about several new environmental, social and governance initiatives that will both reduce our environmental footprint, while helping to lower costs and earned strong returns.  We are a leader in water reuse in the Permian Basin, currently sourcing 90% of our water needs from recycled production water. We are busy transferring our reuse technology to other Basins. EOG is also a first mover and we believe the largest user of electric powered frac fleets.  Later this year we will be testing the use of solar power to generate electricity for natural gas compression. Our expanding implementation of water reuse, electric frac fleets and solar power are just a few of the many things we are doing to reduce our environmental footprint.  Our goal is to be the leader in ESG Performance by delivering high returns with responsibly focused operations. We will have more details in our updated sustainable report to be published later this year.  The EOG culture is more than three decades in the making, and the foundation of our competitive advantage. Our ability to continuously improve the company is accelerating over time. It\u2019s not just a few items that we work on, it's every nut and bolt and every process in the company.  Our culture of innovation, leverage through the application of real time data analysis, with our advanced information technology systems enables everyone in the company to create value. EOGs business is better than ever and our insatiable desire to improve has us excited about our future.  Next up is Billy to review our second quarter operational performance and the outlook for the remainder of 2019. Billy Helms : Thanks Bill. For the second consecutive quarter, oil production beats the high end of our forecasted range, while the capital expenditures were below the low end. The performance in the first half of the year demonstrates our focus on continuous improvement as evidenced by our higher capital efficiency, lower operating costs and ongoing integration of operating practices to minimize our environmental footprint. There are several factors that drive these outstanding results. First, our production beat this quarter is due to improve well performance. Our new completion designs, including the use of diverters, along with a continued focus on target selection are the main reasons for the improvement.  Beyond the completion design itself, we also developed proprietary technology that allows us to make real time adjustments during the execution of the frac, to minimize the impact on nearby producing wells, thus reducing shut-in volumes. Ken will expand on this technology in a moment. Second, we continue to reduce capital costs and see line of sight to reach our goal of reducing total well cost by 5% this year. Through the first half we have realized about a 4% reduction compared to 2018, as a result of improved operational execution. Design enhancements and efficiency improvements, not service cost reductions, are delivering consistently better results across each of our active areas.  Third, our operating cost performance has been outstanding. As a result, we are lowering our full year unit cost forecast for LOE and transportation. Cash operating costs which include LOE, transportation and G&A are expected to be under $9 a barrel for the full year 2019 compared to nearly $13 a barrel as recently as 2014.  Fourth, as Bill mentioned in his opening remarks, we are committed to sustainability. Our decision to embrace electric frac fleets is an example of how we continue to find innovative solutions, to both reduce our environmental footprint and improve the profitability of our business. We began piloting this new technology last year in the Eagle Ford and have since utilized them in the Delaware Basins.  Electric frac fleets currently make up more than a quarter of EOG fleets. We believe EOG is using about a third of the electric frac fleets available in the market, and we are looking to expand their use in our operations going forward. Our experience with this new technology has been very positive. We estimate electric fleets save up to $200,000 per well and reduce combustion emissions from completion operations about 35% to 40%.  The EOG continues to expand its use of water reuse program. In the Delaware Basin nearly 90% of our water needs are currently sourced from recycled produced water. We are increasing our water reuse efforts in both the Eagle Ford and Woodford plays and are beginning to install reuse infrastructure in the emerging Powder River Basin.  In the second half of this year we plan to initiate a pilot project that combines solar and natural gas to power compressor stations. While this first of its kind system is still in the design phase, early indications point to positive economics, reduced LOE and the potential to significantly reduce our combustion emissions. Finally, looking ahead to the remainder of 2019, we modestly increased our full year U.S. oil production guidance as a result of better well performance. There is no change to our activity level in 2019. We will remain disciplined and still expect capital expenditures to be within the original range of $6.1 billion and $6.5 billion.  Capital is trending to the low side of expectations, so assuming the trend continues, any realized savings if spent will likely be directed to two areas, water, oil and gas infrastructure to lower our operating expenses, and lease holds to support our ongoing exploration efforts. For 2020 we are beginning to evaluate multiple scenarios, but sufficed to say, it is too early to provide any color or commentary on our plans at this time. In summary, our operating teams are executing the 2019 program and generating excellent results; I could not be more proud of them. Now I would like to provide some color on our Powder River Basin activity. In the first half of the year we initiated a handful of delineation and completion technology tests to better define our future program. As a reminder, we announced premium inventory at more than 1,500 locations with reserve potential of 1.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent, exactly one year ago.  We are deliberately developing the play at a very modest pace to allow time to integrate both the build out of infrastructure, as well as incorporate the data and knowledge from our delineation wells. In addition, our diverse portfolio of 11 different plays gives us the luxury of pacing the development of the Powder River Basin, to maximize returns in net present value of the entire asset. During the second quarter we completed five gross Narborough wells with average 30 day IPs of 1,000 barrels of oil per day, 100 barrels per day of NGLs and 2.1 million cubic feet of gas per day. The tiburon 251 well had an IP30 of 1,300 barrels of oil per day, 63 barrels per day of NGLs and 2 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. Also, our operating teams are making tremendous progress toward reaching our stated well cost goals.  In the Mowry we completed two gross wells in the second quarter. The flat Boed 870 well had an IP30 of 910 barrels of oil per day, 64 barrels per day of NGLs with 6.3 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. We also completed six gross Turner wells with an average IP30 of 700 barrels of oil per day, 150 barrels per day of NGLs and 2.7 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. Our program in the Powder River Basin continues to deliver strong results and we will continue to develop at a modest pace as infrastructure is installed.  In the Wyoming DJ Basin it is continuing to deliver solid production results with improving operational execution. We completed 18 gross wells in the second quarter, with six wells having an average lateral length exceeding 14,000 feet. In all, the Codell wells delivered an average IP30 of 800 barrels of oil per day. Next up is Ken to review highlights from our Eagle Ford and Woodford plays. Ken Boedeker : Thanks Billy. The Eagle Ford continues to deliver consistent performance quarter-after-quarter. This world class oil asset is off to a great start in 2019, delivering low finding costs through ongoing cost reductions. Every measure of capital productivity is better in the first half of 2019 compared to full year 2018. This quarter I\u2019ll highlight recent operational efficiencies driven by right sizing our completion designs and refining its execution. The wellbore stimulation process is aided by software developed in house, using our proprietary software and data on the nearby wells geology, spacing, lateral placement and production history, a unique completion design is prepared for each well in a pattern. The software allows EOG engineers to monitor real-time completions data, not only on the well we are stimulating, but also on surrounding wells. This enables the engineers to make real-time adjustments to the stimulation on a stage-by-stage basis. The result is a customized stimulation that can reduce pump time by 10%. The process also yields better well performance, both in and the new wells being completed and in the adjacent producing wells. For the new well, we can realize the same or better well performance with less sand. As a result, our completion costs are down 9% compared to last year, which is a significant contributor to our overall lower finding costs.  Second, for the nearby producing wells, reduced sand loadings translate to reduce instances of sand reaching these offset wells. LOE costs come down due to reduced work over expenses to clean out sand during production and the associated downtime due to shut-ins is reduced, increasing volumes. In addition to completion cost reductions, we improved drawing speed and efficiency in the Eagle Ford. Thus far we've nearly realized or full year well cost reduction goal of 5%.  Now, moving the discussion Oklahoma, the Woodford Oil Play in the Anadarko Basin continues to gain operational momentum as we increase our activity levels. We've made tremendous improvements on total well costs. Drilling costs are down 10% and completion costs are down 19% with a total well cost reduction of 18% in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. As a result, we reduced our Woodford well cost target by 14% to $6.5 million per well. Finding costs for this newer premium oil play are now less than $10 per barrel of oil equivalent, which is on par with our other more established premium assets.  We completed 15 gross well since the start of the year, a few notable recent wells include the Galaxy 2536 wells. They average more than 10,000 feet in lateral length and produced an average of 1,100 barrels of oil per day each for the first 30 days. Oil equivalence average more than 1,400 barrels per day each. In addition, these walls are exhibiting the characteristic shallower declines we\u2019ve seen in prior wells.  We are pleased with our progress in this premium play and expect further operational gains in the second half of this year.  Now here's Ezra for an update on the Delaware Basin. Ezra Yacob : Thanks Ken. We played 65 net wells to sales in the second quarter and continue to have an outstanding year in the Delaware Basin. Our drilling performance continues to benefit from improved downhole motor designs and increased quality assurance. Year-to-date drilling days are down over 20% compared to 2018 and we continue to utilize proprietary software to balance our drilling speed and steering to stay within our precision targets. Completion costs are also down 10% compared to 2018 due to ongoing improvements to execution, application of our new completion techniques, as well as lower sand and water costs. Year-over-year stand costs are down 35% and our all-in-water costs including reuse have decreased by 30%. The combined impact of improved drilling and completions efficiencies has resulted in a year-to-date total average well cost reduction of 5% compared to 2018. Well productivity similar to operating efficiencies has also improved through the first half of 2019, across all five of our Delaware Basin targets. In our Delaware Basin Wolfcamp play, 30, 60 and 90 day rates have improved. Our 2019 Wolfcamp program is outperforming 2018 performance by 10% and continues to exceed our forecast.  Performance of our shallower reservoir is also improving as we integrate geologic data, collected as we develop the deeper targets, along with our new completion technology. Year-to-date we brought on 23 net wealth in the Leonard and Bone Spring, with both formations performance stronger than 2018 results. In addition to tremendous progress lowering our finding and development costs through well productivity and capital cost improvements, we are benefiting from our strategic infrastructure investment. Currently 99% of our water and over 80% of our oil is transferred by pipe rather than trucking and contributes to a 5% reduction in operating costs compared to 2018.  The impact of improved productivity and cost reductions have resulted in year-to-date all in finding costs below $10 per barrel of oil equivalent and an average direct after tax rate of return in excess of 100% of the current strip prices. Our progress throughout 2019 in the Delaware Basin highlights our focus on increasing capital efficiency through high return investments.  Here\u2019s Lance to provide a marketing update. Lance Terveen : Thanks Ezra. During the second quarter our marketing strategy paid dividends. Our execution is a result of a portfolio sales approach; that is we work to ensure each of our asset teams has flexible takeaway and multiple in-markets available, which provide security, a full assurance and access the optimal net back price. Our U.S. crude oil price realizations averaged $1.18 above WTI which was on the high end of our guidance issued at the beginning of the quarter. With respect to natural gas, despite significant volatility and Permian Basin prices and softness in the Rockies and out west in California, EOGs overall natural gas price realizations were only modestly affected.  Anticipating infrastructure and transportation capacity, well in advance of our development plans has allowed us to have full assurance to one, mitigate most of the effects of the week local premium pricing; and two, avoid the long term, high fixed cost transport contracts, as we expect the Waha basis will improve significantly as new pipelines in our service later this year and 2021.  Downstream markets, natural gas and oil basis differentials change very quickly. Our portfolio approach provides flexibility to quickly pivot to the highest net back markets. For example, in the Permian the Mid\u2010Cush differential has strengthened considerably since the end of last year. Additionally, looking ahead to the end of this year and into 2020, the market is pricing in crude oil pipeline take away, coming in the service over the next several months, as seen in the narrower Permian to Gulf Coast spread. Our marking arrangements provide flexibility to sell our oil production in the local Midland market to take advantage of strength in the Mid\u2010Cush basis, or we can elect to utilize our low cost, long haul capacity to the Gulf Coast, the excess domestic refiners and export markets.  Our forward looking portfolio approach has established access to Midland, Cushing, Houston, and Corpus Christi, along with doc capacity to access export markets for our Permian basin and oil production. In addition, access to all these markets by our diverse portfolio transportation, and self-markets options allows us to maintain direct control and keep our low cost transportation edge. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss our financials and capital structure. Tim Driggers : Thanks Lance. EOG leveraged its outstanding operation execution in the second quarter into superb financial performance. During the quarter the company generated discretionary cash flow of $2.1 billion, invested $1.6 billion in capital expenditures before acquisitions at the low end of our guidance and paid $127 million in dividends. This allows $352 million in free cash flow.  In line with our objective of further strengthening our financial position, we repaid a $900 million bond in June with cash-on-hand. This leaves $1.75 billion remaining in our $3 billion, four year debt reduction plan which we expect to complete in 2021.  Cash on the balance sheet at June 30 was $1.2 billion and total debt was $5.2 billion for a net debt to total capitalization ratio 16%, significantly lower than 24% just one year ago.  In addition to the excess of the debt reduction plan has had on improving our leverage metrics, it has also meaningfully reducing our cash cost. Net interest expense has fallen about a third to $185 million, the mid-point of our fill year 2019 guidance from $282 million in 2016.  The financial model for EOG is straightforward. We can very efficiently generate double digit organic growth at high rates of return, leverage our scale to reduce operating expenses and continue to lower the old price required to earn a double digit ROCE. We believe EOG can accomplish this while supporting a growing dividend competitive with the S&P500 in generating a rising stream of free cash flow. The combination of EOGs financial strength, industry leading cost structure and organic exploration edge can deliver a level of financial performance, competitive not just with the best E&P companies, but competitive with the best companies in the industry in the S&P500 and we can deliver this performance at lower and lower commodity prices.  I'll now turn it back over to Bill for closing remarks. Bill Thomas : Thanks Tim. In conclusion EOG is executing at the highest level in company history and improving every quarter. Our premium drilling strategy combined with our ability to achieve continuous efficiency gains and technology breakthroughs are producing record results.  The company is delivering a strong return on capital employed, production growth, free cash flow, debt reduction and strong dividend growth with oil in the 50s, and we clearly are on a path to achieve strong performance with oil in the 40s. We are accomplishing our goal of achieving results that are competitive with the best companies across all sectors in the S&P500 through the commodity price cycles.  In addition to financial returns, EOGs mission is to be a leader in ESG performance. Our unique culture has embraced ESG with the same enthusiasm as everything else we do, innovation, technology and the pleased but not satisfied culture of EOG have a long history of producing outstanding results, and we believe that our best days are still ahead of us.  Thanks for listening and now we'll go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And today\u2019s first question comes from Arun Jayram of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Arun Jayram : Yeah, good morning. I was wondering if we could maybe start with your thoughts on well spacing in the Delaware Basin and how you guys are managing the process to call it maximize resource recovery while mitigating the impacts from adverse communication? Bill Thomas : Yeah, good morning Arun. Thank you for the question. Just in general, you know because we\u2019ve been in the shale business for two decades, you know we have a big learning curve in the history of the company and we recognize the parent child relationship and the importance of proper spacing to develop the assets correctly.  And specifically you know in the Delaware Basin we attack that problem very aggressively back in 2017 and the early part of 2018, and we really got the learning curve on that well behind us and we continually are still making progress going forward, but we really are well down the road on maximizing the value of our asset. And so I'd like to maybe let Ezra, he\u2019s really the expert on the Delaware Basin to give you a little bit more color on that. Ezra Yacob : Yes Arun, it\u2019s Ezra. As you know our resource estimate is based on 660 foot spacing in the Wolfcamp Oil window, and an 880 foot space in the combo side of that play and we are very confident in those numbers still. As you know and as Bill mentioned, we've been drilling multiple targets within the Wolfcamp and actually a tighter spacing on average than what our resource estimate is based on and so I think that you can see we've got a bit upside we feel like, not only really in our Delaware Basin Plays but across the portfolio of our plays.  One way that we approached it and some of the testing that we did as Bill mentioned over a year ago is really to look at the number of targets and the quality of our high precision target that need to be co-developed with one another, and we combine our high precision targeting with our completions technology to really optimize that balance between a low finding cost and optimizing really the NPV per drilling unit and we think that that's the best way to really deliver shareholder value in the long term through you know increasing our corporate level returns while still capturing the NPV. Arun Jayram : Great and my follow up is the updated guide does assume, call it the deceleration in CapEx in 4Q versus 3Q. I was wondering if you could maybe discuss the cadence of overall [indiscernible] in the second half and just your general thoughts on 4Q oil growth and sustaining some of the upper- aiding momentum into 2020. Bill Thomas : Yes Arun, yeah we are on plan, everything is going just almost perfectly this year. It\u2019s been a great year in performance and capital is running according to plan, and we are going to be really well set up heading into 2020. And I'm going to ask Billy Helms to give a little bit more detail on that. Billy Helms : Yeah, good morning Arun. This is Billy. So as Bill mentioned, we are exactly on plan where we wanted to be. Actually our well performance is exceeding the type curves that we laid out at the beginning at the year, and our well cost is actually coming in lower.  So what's driving that really is just the continued efficiencies each of the operating teams continue to have. So we're actually able to \u2013 as we go into our second half of the year, in both the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford, our two most active plays, we'll see a slight reduction in rig count and frac crews there, just because we don't need as many rigs and frac fleets to achieve our goals that we originally laid out at the beginning of the year.  Now also on top of that we have some seasonal programs like the Bakken where you'll see activity there, mainly it happens in the summer-time and in the winter-time we pretty much slow activity there just because of the additional costs associated with winter operations. You'll see a slight reduction also in the Powder River Basin for the same reason.  So in general, we don't really see a dramatic change in the rig count, frac fleet count or the wells turned online, a slight drop in the fourth quarter. The big thing to take away is that for 2020 while it\u2019s really early to give you an indication of what we're going to do, we don't see that we\u2019ll have a dramatic drop off in the first quarter of 2020. We are well positioned and well set out to provide growth on a quarter-to-quarter basis as we enter 2020. Arun Jayram : Great. Thanks a lot for that commentary. Operator : And our next question today comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Singer : Thank you, good morning. I wanted to see on the dividend. How does your dividend goal that have shifted in terms of the focus of the 2% target yield, how does that, if at all impact your volume growth target? Do you still see growth in 2020 accelerating versus 2019, and how long can that growth be sustained while meeting your dividend targets until the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin move into a more mature phase as you call it from the growth phase or until you depend more on the newer plays or organic exploration. Bill Thomas : Yeah, Brian, good morning. We don\u2019t see that our projection of being competitive with the S&P 500 on the yield as really slowing down our growth. You know we believe that our dividend, you know we've shown a very strong commitment to the dividend, we've increased it over 70% in the last two years and certainly our goal, with reasonable oil prices like we've seen this year, is to continue to grow the dividend at least 20% per year to bring the yield in line with the S&P500 and of course the Board considers the macro outlook in our business plan every quarter concerning the dividend.  And then on growth at reasonable oil prices like we've seen this year, we do not envision our growth to be lower than our 14% that we are experiencing this year. So we have a very, I think robust business as Tim pointed out; we are creating significant value through our disciplined reinvestment and the premium drilling and we're generating strong free cash flow. You know we're having a substantial dividend growth and we've got \u2013 strengthening our balance sheet all the same time. So we believe our core business is super strong and competitive, with really any business in any sector of the market. So we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence that we're creating a huge amount of value for shareholders and we're going to continue on that plan. Brian Singer : Great, thank you. And then my follow-up in regards to exploration, I realized that there was not a specific update here. On last call you talked about higher quality reservoirs that could lower decline rates in your supply cost and you referred in your opening comments to potentially lowering the decline rate and reducing the cost to produce oil. Can you just give us a general update on what you are seeing within that portfolio and how aspirational that is versus how far you\u2019ve progressed towards that in terms of reality of really having that confidence that the decline rate can come down and the supply costs can come down? Bill Thomas : Brian, we are \u2013 yeah, thank you. We are very excited about our exploration efforts this year. It's the most robust, diverse exploration effort I think we've ever had in the company. We are in multiple basins and multiple different plays, testing new ideas and they are rock quality, rock that would be able to deliver oil at lower cost and at lower decline rates than our current inventory, the average of our current inventory.  So we are really focused on corporate returns. We want to drive, continue to drive down finding costs and that's a particularly strong focus. So we are looking for plays that have low drilling costs, low operating costs and we're working and we want to improve the decline rate of the company also. So low decline, low finding costs is the direction that we are heading, going in, and that's what will help us continue to generate higher corporate returns going forward.  So we're really excited, we are really encourage, we are in the process of drilling and testing a lot of new ideas this year. We are also leasing very, very strong acreage positions, building very strong acreage positions at low costs and we\u2019ll be giving up dates on that as we get meaningful results. It takes a little while, we don't want to just drill one well you know and say we got all this. We need to have multiple tests done.  Certainly we want to, before we start talking about specifically where these plays are, we want to have the acreage captured and so it's going to take a little bit of time. So we asked the investors to be patient with us on the process, but we're very excited and very encouraged on where we're headed. Brian Singer : Great, thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Neal Dingmann : Good morning all. A question I guess to start around the Powder River. It seems like when it comes to incremental operational efficiencies and lower costs, it appears in terms of your conversations and very much on the Powder River is seen maybe the most in your portfolio, and I'm wondering if this is in fact the case. The Powder has seen you know some of the most improvement and then just wondering for overall portfolio can you continue to see, just the remarkable efficiencies that you all talked about in the last couple of quarters. Bill Thomas : Yeah, good morning Neal. Yeah, we are super excited about the Powder. It's got a lot of obviously upside, and we're in a learning curve. So we are testing as Billy talked about, different parts of the play, but particularly we are testing the targeting and the completion technology. So the wells will vary a little bit as we go through that process, but we're learning and that we're not really in a hurry. We want to take advantage of a learning curve before we you know increase activity there significantly.  We don't have a lot of acreage exploration issues there. So we've got plenty of inventory in all the places of the company. So we can bring that on at the proper speed to maximize the returns and lower costs and build the inventory correctly. Neal Dingmann : Okay, and then just one separate one if I could. It appears to me your exploration program remains this year a bit more active than we\u2019ve seen in the last year or two. I\u2019m just kind of curious if you all are focused here on ramp in one potential area or are you all looking at several potential plays when we look at the exploration. Bill Thomas : I\u2019m going to ask \u2013 Neal, I\u2019m going to ask Ezra to comment on that. Ezra Yacob : Yes Neal, this is Ezra. We have multiple opportunities that we have this year that were both leasing and testing this year. As Bill highlighted a few minutes ago, really the goal of the exploration program this year is to add quality to our inventory and not just quantity. What we mean by that is you know it all starts with the rock quality and so we're looking at \u2013 we basically, you know the advantage of having activity in six different basins this year as we drilled these wells, we collect a lot of data and we're able to formulate that data and that's really the basis for what has created our exploration effort this year. I'm looking at this better rock quality.  We think that this rock quality we are targeting will really benefit from our horizontal drilling and completions techniques and as Bill said, should provide us an opportunity to add lower finding cost and higher quality of inventories to our already robust portfolio. Neal Dingmann : Thank you so much guys. Operator : And our next question today comes from Bob Brackett of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Bob Brackett : I had a question on the electric frac spreads. You quoted the $200,000 per well savings. Part of that is the fuel arbitrage diesel verses nat-gas and part of it is the cost you\u2019re paying the service provider. Is there a way I can think about how those two offset each other? Billy Helms : Yeah Bob, this is Billy Helms. Yeah the $200,000 savings, I'd say the majority of that is simply in the fuel cost savings and the reason why it benefits us so much is we're using it in place where we have readily available infrastructure to be able to access gas as a fuel source, relative to diesel as a traditional frac fleet not used. They also do provide us a great deal of a step up and efficiency gains to, so our efficiency games there provide I'd say the balance of the savings, but the majority of it is based on the fuel savings alone. So I wouldn\u2019t want to mislead you there, the efficiency gains are really good, but the majority is fuel savings. Bob Brackett : Great, thanks. Follow-on would be, if we think about the 740 net planned completion for 2019 and wanting to hit that activity level, how would you balance that against the macro sell-off in the commodity where price fell and cash flow fell. Would you stick to the plan, would you trim the plan in order to hit cash flow? Where does that balance play out? Bill Thomas : Yeah Bob, this is Bill. Certainly you know we are going to run the business with the balance cash flow. You know we're not going to outstand cash flow. So you know depending on our view of the length of that, you know downturn and oil process, we thought it was temporary. You know we might not make much adjustments, but we thought it was a super long term. You know we would certainly readjust the company.  Our goal you know is not to grow specifically, our goal is returns. We are focused on increasing corporate returns going forward, generating strong free cash flow, certainly we're committed to the dividend very strongly as a company. So those all have a super priority in the company and we're here for the long term, we are going to run our business right, we're going to generate maximum value for our shareholders. Bob Brackett : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate : Thanks, good morning everyone. Bill, I think you\u2019ve kind of set the cat amongst the pigeons by talking about the uncertain outlook for 2020. I think we're all facing the same thing, but I wonder if I could speak to how you would see relative capital allocation in the event that we did have a downturn. It's really \u2013 thinking more along the lines of sustaining capital and then beyond that how you a would allocate incremental dollars. If you could just elaborate a little bit as to what I'm trying to get at.  The IRRs are very competitive across your entire portfolio, but the productivity is obviously very different in different plays for the same return. So I'm just curious as to how reallocate or allocating capital to your highest return plays would impact the relative productivity outlook in a downturn. I know it\u2019s kind of a complicated issue, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to get at. Bill Thomas : Yeah Doug, I appreciate it, your question. Good morning. We have got tremendous flexibility to allocate capital. We have such an enormously strong premium inventory and it\u2019s across multiple plays. So as I answered in the previous question, you know we're not interested in outstanding cash flow, certainly not on a long term basis. We are going to stay super disciplined and make sure that we generate free cash flow every year.  So you know if we had \u2013 we don't believe we\u2019re going to have an extended downturn or low downturn, but it\u2019s in an extreme case that we did that, you know we would just tighten the belt all across the company. We would focus our capital on the highest return plays and we would allocate capital appropriately to the macro environment.  So we're focused on returns and we believe we can generate the highest returns of any company in the E&P business at the lowest oil price scenarios, because we have the highest reinvestment hurdle of any E&P company we know. And so our premium inventory is good to go at $40 oil and that allows EOG to be the low cost provider of oil and gives us a tremendous competitive advantage. Doug Leggate : I know it's not an easy question to answer, so I'm going to follow-up with an even worse question, I apologize. You've also \u2013 I don't know if the language was deliberate on your dividend comment on the press release, but targeting, setting out a target yield kind of starts to bring in considerations of how the market thinks about valuations, something about dividend discount models, which then begs a couple of obvious questions as one, what do you see is the appropriate growth rate for the dividend? This is supported basically by what you said earlier about not less than 14% oil growth.  And then related to that, those implications for the payout ratio, have you \u2013 do you have parameters around that, that you could share with us when you've kind of lead out this subject of up 2% yield. Because it\u2019s basically that you know we can all come up with long term projections of what that could look like, but some framework around that would be helpful. Bill Thomas : Yes certainly, Doug. Our goal you know is to continue to aggressively increase the dividend, certainly at the 20% right or better every year, and that would be in consideration of you know reasonable oil prices like we've seen this year, we believe we can do that or better. And so our focus is just to have a sustainable strong dividend growth every year and get the dividend up to the yield of the 2% level.  We don't have a specific timeline to give you, because we need to manage the business according to our view of the business environment obviously going forward, but directionally you know we want to be competitive with the S&P500 companies and the dividend yield just like we're going to be competitive in growth and in return on capital employed. And I think the dividend yield for the S&P is about 2% and so that's where we want to be long term in the company. Doug Leggate : Sorry Bill, just to be clear, the 2%, does that also have an oil price parameter like a you know obviously premier locations or premium inventories at $40 oil. 2% yield is at what commodity price? Bill Thomas : Well no, it's not really based on that. You know the speed of which we can get the yield to that level of course would be you know have oil price considerations. But we are lowering the price of the company to be very successful as we said in the opening remarks, where we can do it very well at 50 with oil in the 50\u2019s right now. But we are really heading the company to where we can be successful with oil in the 40\u2019s. So overtime you know we believe we believe we can be competitive on the dividend returns and growth with oil in the 40\u2019s. Doug Leggate : Understood. Thanks for taking the question. Operator : And our next question today comes from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Campbell : Good morning. I\u2019ve just been listening to the lower decline stuff of great interest and I just thought I'd ask you if we think of a typical first year, unconventional decline is say 60%, can you roughly quantify how much the decline rates could be modified with these new exploration plays that you've been discussing? I don't mean the corporate decline, I mean of the well decline in one of these new plays. Bill Thomas : Yeah Jeffrey, this is Bill. You know, we are really in the early process of testing these plays and so we just need to get some well results behind us to give you specific numbers on that and some history. But these are plays that have better matrix probability than a typical shale play. We are not looking for a rock that has nanodarcy firm. This is really more microdarcy, maybe even millidarcy firm kind of rocks and there are also rocks that would respond really well to the horizontal completion technology.  So we even get a complex fracture pattern, where you can drill long laterals, etcetera, and you can contact a lot of this better probability rock to wellbore. And so that combination and just in general will give you a high recovery for the metal oil in place, but it also gives you lower decline rates than the current shale plays. Jeffrey Campbell : And that sounds really interesting. We look forward to hearing more about that in the future. I think my other question is I believe last quarter you said that the Eagle Ford EUR program was completed or more or less complete. I just wondered, do you have any other programs going on anywhere else in the portfolios that\u2019s experimenting with or seeking to try to capture more resource, total resource from the wells than what we typically expect in an unconventional resource. Bill Thomas : I\u2019m going to ask Ken to comment on that. Ken Boedeker : Yeah, this is Ken. We have about 150 wells in our enhanced delivery process in the Eagle Ford and we are really are seeing premium results in line with our 30% to 70% ad in our primary recovery. You know we are really watching our program and refining our process as we go, the process that you want to do after your primary drilling is complete. So we're going to evaluate expanding that EUR footprint in that area as we finish primary drilling in the surrounding units. As far as expanding that into other areas, we are constantly evaluating that, but we are not expanding that process into any of the other formations at this time. Jeffrey Campbell : Okay, great, thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Leo Mariani of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Leo Mariani : Hey guys, very impressive progress on the cost reduction initiatives. I guess basically you're sort of in 80% your targets here, you know by mid-year on the well costs. Just wanted to get a sense \u2013 I know it\u2019s probably you know difficult question. Of course no one can kind of predict the future here, but just based on efficiencies, do you guys think that it's realistic that you might be able to knock another say 5% off those costs again in 2020 or 2021. Bill Thomas : Good morning Leo. I\u2019m going to ask Billy to comment on that. Billy Helms : Yeah Leo, first of all let me just say, we're extremely proud of the efforts that are operational teams have made to get to the 4% hurdle halfway through the year. When we set our 5% goal out at the start of the year, I think you know we had no idea exactly how quickly they would get there, but confidence that they would and they've excelled just tremendously. You know being able to accomplish another 5% next year, it's a little early to say where that\u2019s going to come from, but I do have confidence that we'll be able to continue to lower costs. I mean there's no doubt in my mind that we can continue to push well cost down. And not just well costs, but also our unit costs, you know we're making tremendous progress there.  So I don't want to go without given those guys a kudos as well, because they've done a great job and I guess we just have so much confidence in our teams, that I know we can achieve continued cost reductions across the board. Leo Mariani : Okay, that's great. And I guess just, you know wanted to \u2013 a quick question on some of the guidance here. So just looking at your third quarter U.S. oil production guidance versus the last few quarters, just noticing that you're kind of rate of growth in U.S. oil slows a little bit in the third quarter. Just wanted to get a sense if there is anything to read into that or is that just kind of timing sort of on well tie-ins here. Billy Helms : Yeah Leo, this is Billy again. Yeah the rate of growth certainly slows a little bit in the third quarter, but really it falls directly in line with what our plan was laid out at the start the year, and as you know most of our activity in capital expenditure was in the first half, so that's where you're going to see most your production growth.  So it will modestly decrease; the rate of growth will modestly decreased a little bit the third and fourth, but we're still on pace to really stay within our plan and then we're not concerned at all about how that sets up for the following year. We are still in great shape as we go into the next year as well. Leo Mariani : Okay, that's very helpful, and I guess just any you know follow-up thoughts on U.S. exports. Obvious you guys unveiled incremental volumes that should be shipping out you know last quarter and certainly made a point to put it in your slide. As you kind of look at the marketing side over the next couple years, do you guys think that U.S. oil exports are going to become even more important for you, and is that an area you are going to be looking to expand going forward. Bill Thomas : Let me let Lance comment on that. Lance Terveen : Hey Leo, good morning. This is Lance. How are you? Leo Mariani : Great. Lance Terveen : Yeah good. Hey, here on the exports it's definitely exciting. You know as we\u2019ve talked about in the past we've got our \u2013 you know today we've got our existing Houston capacity, you know we're taking advantage of that, but we get more excited about next year with our capacity growing in corpus.  So I think one of the things that really you know to think about us from an EOG standpoint, what really differentiates us is when you think about the Corpus capacity, we're going to have the capability to really show you know our segregated WTL, you know that we are going to be able to show across the docks and we're also going to be able to show our Eagle Ford as well.  So I think, you know when you look a lot of peers and you look at a lot of our, you know the competition that\u2019s out there too, our capability with our transportation capacity, the storage tankage that we have, ability to deliver segregations you know into the market, you know we're going to be able to show multiple grades across the market.  And yes, absolutely, I think you're seeing you know spread tighten up and I think we don't see any concerns as it relates to export capacity, you know at least in the short term. But I think one of the more important points to make is you know if you call export capacity right at 4.5 million barrels per day of export capacity. What we felt was very important is that we secured existing Brownfield capacity, so that way if you do see price dislocations that do occur maybe at the dock. You know we're advantaged there because we're not waiting in on permitting; we're not waiting on doc expansion. So our capacity is going to ramp-up you know as we move in to next year and I think that's going to be key because you know we can really take advantage of the values if there is a dislocation.  And again we've got the flexibility that we can pivot our barrels and we can supply our great customers or domestic refiners. But then we can also supply to international markets as well. So we've got a full range you know in our portfolio there Leo. Leo Mariani : Okay, well that's great color. Maybe just on that point, do you think there\u2019s a decent chance there could be dislocations over the next couple years? Just wanted to get a sense how you are thinking about that piece. Lance Terveen : Yeah, I'm not going to speculate you know. I think when you've definitely seen you know when you look at the forward curves, you can see kind of the Brent NEH spreads and that's right around $3, so it definitely shows that the export order is opened you know, but I think for us, you\u2019ve seen \u2013 we talked about in our opening comments too about the Permian, kind of the Gulf Coast spreads, it\u2019s definitely narrowed. So I think really where you could possibly see the price dislocation is that you got a lot of oil that\u2019s going to show up at Corpus and there's going to be some players that aren\u2019t going to have secure dock capacity, and so there could be a dislocation that occurred there. But as it relates to EOG and what we've done, we went ahead and kind of take that \u2013 we took that variable time out of the play. As we think about our growth and then our capacity ramping up and then how we're going to place barrels in the next four months. Operator : And our next question today comes Paul Sankey from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Paul Sankey : Good morning all. Just kind of bringing together everything that you talked about this morning, well I was wondering, just in terms of your comp, that\u2019s your position against the oil industry as opposed to the whole market, where do you think you are furthest ahead of the industry and where do you think is the furthest to go and obviously I'm talking about the various components of your business, whether it's the acreage, the exploration, drilling, fracking, operating, transport and even decline rates. Thanks. Bill Thomas : Yeah, good morning Paul. You know clearly the competitive advantage that EOG has is our culture. Our culture is just amazing. It really drives all the success of the company. We have tremendous assets because the culture has built out over the years through our exploration efforts. You know we have tremendous cost reduction, continuous sustainable cost reduction, because our culture never is satisfied. It's just continually innovative and it continues to figure out better ways to run our business. So really the confidence that we have about the direction of the company to be able to be very successful, even with oil process in the 40\u2019s is really due to our culture. And of course that's supported by a lot of different things. We have a core competency obviously in exploration; we\u2019ve got a core competency in operations, you know we drilled the wells the fastest in the U.S. and the lowest comps, leading completion technology.  We have by far the most advanced information technology systems where we can make real time decisions continuously across the company and the real value of the company is coming from every person in the company, the value of EOG is not top down driven, it's really from every person in the company. So that's our \u2013 that's where we have the lead and that is not easily duplicated. It's taken us three decades to build a culture of where it is right now and we believe our culture is improving as we go forward. So we're super excited about where EOG is and where we're heading. Paul Sankey : Thanks Bill. If I could make it much more specific, could you just talk a bit more about e-fracking; that seems to be very interesting. Thank you. Bill Thomas : Yeah Paul, I\u2019m going to ask Billy to comment on that. Billy Helms : Yeah Paul, as far as e-fracking goes, you know we got into the idea of utilizing the electric frac fleets, mainly because we are attracted by the efficiency gains, as well as the cost reduction. The efficiency gains is what really we view as being sustainable to help lower our cost long term and that has continued to get better with continued use.  We've got four of those frac fleets operating today in the Eagle Ford and the Delaware basin and we're always looking for ways to continue to utilize our infrastructure to enable that to be spread into other plays. So I think as you look forward, we will look for opportunities to continue to put those in new plays.  It's unique and that the fuel savings are mainly achieved through not only the cost of the gas, but really our ability, the ability of our facility teams to get ahead of the completions and come up with innovative solutions to get the gas readily available to the frac fleets and without that infrastructure and those teams enabling to do that, we wouldn\u2019t be able to take advantage of it to the extent that we are. So just super proud of that effort and where it's taken us. Paul Sankey : Yeah, just a quick follow up. Could you talk about the capacity of that and we'll see \u2013 I think you mentioned how big you are in the market. Could you just repeat how much of it you'll go in with I think. A - Bill Thomas : Yeah, I think you know what we're hearing and certainly this number might move a little bit, but there's currently about 11 frac fleets available in the market today. We're using about four of those and our frac fleet count varies you know week to week, but typically we\u2019re running about 16 frac fleets, 15 or 16. So that's about a quarter of our frac fleet in the company. End of Q&A: Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this includes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Thomas for any final remarks. Bill Thomas : In closing, I first want to say thank you to everyone at EOG for their tremendous contribution to our performance in the first half of 2019. We're proud and honored to be on the same team. The company is performing at the highest level in history and we continue to improve every quarter. We\u2019re excited about the second half of the year and the years beyond. We\u2019re focused on returns and creating significant long term value. Well, thanks for listening and thanks for your support. Operator : Thank you, sir. Today\u2019s conference has now concluded and we thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day!",

Participating on the call this morning are : Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP Exploration and Production; Ezra Yacob, EVP Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP Marketing; David Streit, VP Investor and Public Relations. Here's Bill Thomas. Bill Thomas : Thanks Tim and good morning everyone. EOG has a deeply rooted competitive advantage and that is our culture. Our culture drives innovation and a long history of continuous improvement and success. Most importantly, our culture drives resiliency. In an ever-changing business environment, we have demonstrated this resiliency time and time again during the past 20 years, as we will continue to do so moving forward. In the 1990s when vertical prospects were in short supply, our culture fostered innovations that made EOG our first-mover in horizontal shale gas technology. As natural gas prices came under pressure in the late 2000s, we introduced horizontal shale oil with the Eagle Ford discovery. As a result of our first-mover advantage, EOG is now the largest onshore oil producer in the Lower 48 states and among the lowest cost producers in the world. In the wake of a pronounced commodity price down cycle beginning in late 2014 the company has remained a leader in low-cost, high-return oil growth by switching to a premium drilling strategy. Our premium strategy uses a strict investment hurdle that produces strong economic returns using a flat $40 and $2.50 natural gas price scenario ensuring that the company will generate strong financial performance even in commodity down cycles. After our third consecutive quarter of exceptional results, we believe that EOG's 2019 operational performance will be the best in company's history. To reflect our year-to-date performance, we have raised our U.S. oil growth target from 14% to 15% along with lowering our well cost and per unit operating cost targets. Strong well results have compounded the benefit of cost reductions to further improve capital efficiency, allowing EOG to deliver strong above target production growth with lower-than-expected capital investment. With confident strong returns in growth in the third quarter, the company delivered over $330 million of free cash flow after paying the dividend. EOG continues to deliver returns, growth and free cash flow competitive with the best companies in the S&P 500. In addition to outstanding operating results, we continue to organically grow our premium well inventory in both size and quality. This quarter we added 1700 premium net wells which represents a replacement rate of more than 2 times our 2019 drilling program and brings our total premium drilling inventory to 10,500 net wells. That is more than 14 years of drilling at our current pace. EOG's diverse assets and exploration-led business model position the company to navigate political and regulatory changes. The company maintains tremendous flexibility to adjust operations and activity across 6 different basins and has identified over 5,400 premium well locations representing more than 7 years of premium drilling on nonfederal acreage. In the Permian, one of our most active drilling areas approximately 90% of our federal acreage position is held by legacy production and we have 11 years of premium inventory on nonfederal leases. The 3.2 million net acres of nonfederal leases in the U.S. which is approximately 75% of the company's total acreage, we are confident that we will continue to organically grow our premium inventory in size and quality much faster than we can drill. EOG has approached reducing environmental footprint in the same manner that it continues to improve operational performance. The company looks to innovate through returns focused initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and expanding water reuse throughout our operations. Last quarter we introduced our pilot project for a combined solar and natural gas-powered compression station in the Delaware Basin. This is just one of the many projects that our team is working on that, we believe will contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and generate positive economic returns. EOG and its employees are committed to environmental stewardship. We believe we are a leader in our initiatives to address environmental stewardship and we are focused on finding new opportunities to continue to improve going forward. Finally as we close in on the end of the year, our focus begins to turn to 2020. While it's too early to discuss specifics of our plan next year, we can say the following : number one, our priorities have not changed. We firmly believe that investing in high-return production growth, generating substantial free cash flow and delivering strong dividend growth delivers the highest long-term business value. Number two, our plan is based on a conservative outlook for commodity prices. At $55 WTI we can deliver mid-teens production growth, grow our dividend and generate significant free cash flow. Number three, we believe well cost and per unit operational costs will continue to decline. Number four, we believe capital efficiency and F&D costs will continue to improve. Number five, we have high confidence in the ability of our organic exploration efforts to add and improve our premium drilling inventory faster than we are drilling. And number six, we have no plans for large expensive M&A. Any potential bolt-on acquisition must compete with our premium drilling returns. As we look to the future we know that the business environment will continue to change. But our competitive advantage is rooted in our culture, ensure that we can meet these challenges head on. EOG is a resilient company that will continue to differentiate itself as a leader among any company in any sector of the S&P 500 by creating significant long-term value for our shareholders. Next up is Billy to review our third quarter operational performance and outlook for the remainder of 2019. Billy Helms : Thanks Bill. For the third quarter in a row we exceeded expectations delivering more oil for less capital than we forecasted at the start of the quarter. Oil production beat the high end of our target range at over 464,000 barrels per day and we spent less capital than expected coming in right at the low end of the target range of $1.5 billion. Well performance continues to drive production to the high end of our estimates. As discussed during the second quarter call the primary reasons for the improved well performance are enhanced completion designs along with the use of diverters and a heightened focus on target selection. Capital expenditures continue to trend to the low end of expectations as our operating teams identified new techniques to lower well costs to improve capital efficiency. As of the third quarter, I can report that we have achieved our year-end goal of reducing well cost by 5%. We believe the cost reduction to be sustainable as it is driven by continued efficiency improvements not service cost reductions. For example if you look at our two most active plays; the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford the average time to drill a well has collectively been reduced by 20%. As our drilling teams maintain their steady push to reduce drilling times, we require fewer rigs to execute our program compared to last year. Specifically, we now plan to only average 36 rigs this year as compared to 40 rigs back in February. This is a tremendous testament to the efficiencies of EOG's drilling teams. They were able to realize faster drilling times with innovative advancements such as in-house designed, drilling motors engineered to improve performance and reduce failures. We still plan to complete about 740 wells this year and expect quarter-over-quarter production growth entering 2020. As Bill stated earlier, if oil prices are in the mid-50s, we expect growth in 2020 to be similar to 2019. Capital expenditures -- capital savings from efficiencies realized throughout the year are beginning -- allocated to one of two areas : leasing acreage and new exploration plays and high-return infrastructure projects that are lowering lease operating expense. Across the board, 2019 is shaping up to be the best year we've had operationally and is particularly notable across our company-wide per unit operating expenses. At the start of 2019, lease operating expense on a unit basis was initially forecasted to be flat year-over-year. However, we now expect full year 2019 LOE to be 4% lower than 2018. At the midpoint of our 2019 DD&A guidance range of $12.65, we were on track to deliver the lowest rate since EOG's transition from a natural gas company to oil. Our permanent switch to premium drilling continues to transform the company, driving down finding and development costs, reducing D&A and enabling EOG to deliver double-digit returns throughout commodity price cycles. Also of note during the third quarter, we entered into long-term gas supply arrangements with Cheniere Energy. Consistent with our strategy of having flexibility and diversity in marketing our products, these arrangements provide additional markets for off-take and pricing diversity for up to 440 million BTU per day starting in 2020 with the ultimate goal of maximizing the realized price for our growing production of low-cost natural gas. Now I would like to provide some color on the Bakken and other Rockies plays. In the Bakken this quarter we completed 15 wells with an average IP-30 of 2150 barrels of oil per day, 300 barrels of NGLs and 2 million cubic feet a day of natural gas. Our strong well results reflect the impact of EOG precision targeting and our new completion techniques. The highlight for the quarter was the Clarks Creek 18 well that was completed in the Three Forks with an IP-30 of 3800 barrels of oil per day. This well is our best well to date in the Bakken, which along with strong performance from other wells completed this quarter are a testament to the continued improvements we see across our entire inventory. In the Powder River Basin, we completed a total of eight wells including four wells in the Parkman, three wells in the Turner and one well in the Niobrara. It is worth noting that our premium inventory in the Powder River Basin now includes the Parkman which we have combined with the Turner play. The Niobrara completion, the Arbalest 473 had an IP-30 of 1250 barrels of oil per day with 250 barrels of NGLs and 4 million cubic feet a day of natural gas. We continue to be encouraged by the results of our program in the Powder River and look forward to its growth in the near future. Next up is Ken to discuss the Eagle Ford. Ken Boedeker : Thanks, Billy. Year-after-year, quarter-after-quarter EOG's Eagle Ford asset delivers strong consistent results and the third quarter of 2019 was no different. The Eagle Ford delivered high-return oil volume growth with a continued decline in well costs. We have exceeded our full year cost reduction goal of 5% in the third quarter by continued improvement in operational efficiencies. Specifically, our drilling time has been reduced by 10% to 20% depending on the lateral length in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. We also drilled our fastest well to date in Eagle Ford, the Meadowlark B2H, which was drilled to a measured depth of 17,288 feet with a 7,500-foot lateral section in a remarkable 2.4 days. Even after nearly a decade of development our premium well inventory in the Eagle Ford remains strong at 1900 net locations representing over six years of drilling at current activity levels. We continue to have high confidence in our ability to grow our premium inventory in this play. Our best well to date has a cost that is 20% below our average 2019 well cost. This difference in cost between our best well and the average well this year is evidence of the opportunity ahead to convert our approximately 2200 remaining non-premium locations to premium over time. EOG is in the best position it has ever been in to maximize the value of this flagship asset. Now here's Ezra for an upgrade -- or an update on the Delaware Basin. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Ken. In the Delaware Basin we announced the addition of just under 1700 net premium locations including two new plays, the Third Bone Spring, which accounts for 615 net premium locations and the Wolfcamp Middle or M for short, which contributes 855 net premium locations. The Third Bone Spring and the Wolfcamp M combined -- added approximately 1.6 billion barrels of equivalents of incremental resource potential net to EOG. Additionally, we added over 200 net premium locations from previously identified plays in the Delaware Basin. These locations not only benefit from this year's reduced well costs and increased well performance but also reflect further delineation and greater confidence in areas outside of our core acreage position. The Third Bone Spring is an example of making an old play new again. EOG began drilling the Third Bone Spring sand in our core Red Hills area in Southeast New Mexico over 25 years ago through vertical and horizontal development to exploit these high-quality reservoir sands. Fast forward to today, where modern drilling and completion technology along with the benefit of a large data set of core samples and logs has allowed EOG to exploit the tighter sands shales and carbonate rocks in the Third Bone Spring. While over 1000 horizontal wells have been drilled in the traditional Third Bone Spring sand target across the basin, less than 50 wells have exploited these tighter reservoir targets. With the advantage of a rich trove of technical data, EOG has identified the sweet spots of these new targets and the result is an $8 per barrel of equivalent finding and development cost with a production decline profile somewhat shallower than other plays in the Delaware Basin. We anticipate developing the Third Bone Spring at approximately 880-foot spacing between wells with per well gross reserve potential of approximately 1.2 million barrels of equivalents for a targeted completed well cost of $7.6 million. We also announced the Wolfcamp M with 855 new net premium locations identified across a wide expanse of EOG's acreage position in Lea, Eddy, Loving and Reeves Counties. This combo play with 63% liquids sits below the Upper Wolfcamp plays and is planned to be developed on 1050-foot spacing. A typical Wolfcamp M well is expected to produce approximately 1.5 million barrels of equivalents over its life for a $7.7 million targeted completed well cost. EOG began data collection analysis and delineation of this interval in 2014 and refined our precision targets to the highest quality portion of the reservoir. Utilizing proprietary steering software, we have reduced our specific drilling target by over 20% while simultaneously decreasing our drilling days by 50% compared to the 2014 delineation tests. The combination of increased well productivity, operational efficiency lowering well costs and utilization of water, gas and oil infrastructure has delivered another premium play to EOG's portfolio. Altogether in the Delaware Basin, EOG now has an inventory of approximately 6500 future net premium drilling locations or 24 years of inventory at the current drilling pace. This inventory is based on actual locations customized to the local geology across our over 400,000 acre position and includes multiple targets within the 5000-foot thick column of pay. We use proprietary core log and completions data to determine our targets and spacing and integrate real-time data from every well we drill to improve future wells. In contrast, to one-size-fits-all manufacturing mode, our continual process of data collection, analysis and application allows us to continue improving our wells, lower finding and development costs and optimize returns and net present value for each development unit. We're also confident in our ability to add future premium locations to our current inventory through lower well costs, increased well productivity and additional delineation of targets outside of our core area. For example, in the Wolfcamp oil play, the well count averages a single target being developed at 660-foot spacing across the 226,000 acre play. During 2019 EOG has regularly drilled patterns of wells on tighter spacing including the State Atlantis seven Unit number 1H through 5H, a 5-well Wolfcamp oil development at 440-foot spacing. These two-mile laterals averaged less than a $7 per barrel of equivalent finding and development cost generate over $50 million NPV and average payouts in approximately three months. The bottom line is EOG is very confident that a lot of upside remains to the currently identified drilling potential in this world-class basin. In addition to the updated inventory, EOG's outstanding operational performance during the first half of 2019 has continued through the third quarter in the Delaware Basin. Total well cost for the Wolfcamp oil play has already reached the full year goal of $7.2 million, while operating expenses in the Delaware Basin are also moving down notching a 7% improvement year-to-date compared to 2018. Well productivity in the Delaware Basin also continues to improve across our various plays. Average cumulative oil production for the first 90 days compared to 2018 was up 15% in the Wolfcamp oil play and up 20% in the Second Bone Spring. The standout for the quarter is the McGregor D unit number 5H, which came online an initial 24-hour rate of 11,500 barrels of oil per day and nearly 20 million cubic feet per day of rich natural gas. For its first 30 days, the well averaged 6,400 barrels of oil per day. The McGregor was drilled as part of a three-well package on 700-foot spacing in the Wolfcamp upper target. The entire package produced a staggering 445,000 barrels of oil and 1.2 Bcf of natural gas in the first 30 days of production. These wells benefited from EOG's highly integrated multidisciplinary technical approach to development. Data collection and applying real-time analysis to improve well performance is a hallmark of EOG's approach to unlock upside potential across all of our assets and as highlighted with our announcement of additional premium plays in the Delaware Basin. I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss our financials and capital structure. Tim Driggers : Thanks, Ezra. The benefits of EOG's balanced high-return growth strategy continued to shine through in the financial results in the third quarter. During the quarter, the company generated discretionary cash flow of $2 billion, invested $1.5 billion in capital expenditures before acquisitions toward the low-end of our guidance and paid $166 million in dividends. This brought $337 million in free cash flow. Cash on the balance sheet at September 30 was $1.6 billion and total debt was $5.2 billion for a net debt to total capitalization ratio of 15%. A strong balance sheet is a strategic imperative for EOG. As Bill mentioned, our first priorities for capital allocation in 2020 will be investing in high-return drilling and supporting dividend growth. Two bonds totaling $1 billion are scheduled to mature in 2020. As those dates get closer, we will decide whether to use cash on hand to redeem the bonds or to refinance one or both of them. I'll now turn it back over to Bill for closing remarks. Bill Thomas : Thanks, Tim. In conclusion, there are several important takeaways from this call. First, EOG's 2019 operating performance is the best in company history. Our high-return disciplined growth strategy is producing strong returns, strong growth and substantial free cash flow. At the same time, we continue to get better in every area of the company. Second, our premium inventory continues to grow in both size and quality much faster than we drill it. Third, the company continues to reduce costs and with our pleased-but-not-satisfied mindset, we see endless opportunities to continue to lower cost in the future. Fourth, our GHG reduction and water reuse efforts demonstrate our leading, innovative and returns-focused approach to environmental stewardship and sustainability. And fifth, EOG is a resilient company. Our culture produces sustainable success. As we look ahead, we're confident and excited about the company's ability to continue to create significant long-term shareholder value with performance that competes with the best companies in the S&P 500. Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And the first question we have will come from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Singer : Thank you. Good morning. Bill Thomas : Good morning, Brian. Brian Singer : Can we start on the two new zones in the Permian Basin? First, how are these being integrated into the drilling program? And given the greater wet gas mix, what are the implications for gas NGLs growth and infrastructure needs? And second, in your prepared comments, you mentioned the Bone Spring three helps mitigate the decline profile of the company. Can you add more color on the reasons? And is this the type of decline rate improvement you've been referring to in the past? Or would that be driven by other exploratory projects under evaluation? Bill Thomas : Brian, I'm going to ask for Ezra to comment on the two new zones. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Brian. This is Ezra. Thanks for the question. There's kind of a lot there. So let me tear it apart piece by piece and maybe I'll start with the Wolfcamp Middle first, the Wolfcamp M. With regards to how it will be integrated into the -- into our development, that's a deeper zone across much of our core acreage position. So one great thing about being able to turn this new bench premium is that it has the benefit of having pre-existing well control seismic infrastructure for both oil, gas and water gathering. And one way to look about that the greater wet gas mix is I think it's on slide 47 in our slide deck where we have the Delaware Basin play matrix. It's very similar to the Wolfcamp combo in per well reserves in the gas, oil and NGL make up kind of a combo percentage there. And it's also very similar in cost. And so that gives us great confidence in having a premium play there and the fact that it's going to be a high-return play for a long time. In the Wolfcamp combo, we've turned about 50 wells to sales in the past two years and they're generating over 100% rate of return and approximately $8 million of NPV per well. So we're very excited about that play. On the Third Bone Spring sand shifting gears to that. As we talked about that's kind of a tale of two plays. We've got the more traditional sand target, which definitely because of the better porosity and the better permeability the decline rates are very similar to those in the First Bone Spring and the Second Bone Spring. And yes, I would say on a side bar that that is the type of reservoir quality that we're looking for in our exploration program. And then the second part of that Third Bone Spring probably a little bit slower to integrate it, because it's really as you step outside of our core area and we're delineating some of the new acreage positions on it are these emerging targets that I talked about the Third Bone Spring, the shale and carbonate targets in there. Industry has drilled about 50 wells in those targets and we're very excited about the potential there again as we move into those new areas. Brian Singer : Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up is if you could talk a little bit about the operational momentum into 2020. It is a daunting task to grow 15% from your large base of oil production. So how are you setting up in terms of late 2019 and early 2020 activity? And do you expect ratable growth through the year or a bit more back-end loaded? Bill Thomas : Yes, as we said early in the remarks, Brian that our -- we're really having a fantastic operation this year in the operational momentum that we've got going and the company is going to carry over into 2020. So I'm going to ask Billy to comment a little bit more on the specifics about that. Billy Helms : Yes, thanks Bill. Yes, Brian, as we go into 2020 first of all, it's a little bit early to kind of give you too much detailed guidance on where we are. We don't expect to be able to reduce our rig count any further in 2019. As we go into 2020 depending on what oil prices look like, we'll set what our activity is going to look like, but we certainly have the capability of increasing rig activity if the prices so warrant. The bottom line is we fully expect to deliver quarter-over-quarter production growth as we enter into 2020. So the growth of -- the amount of which would be dependent on what the oil prices look like. Operator : Next we have Subash Chandra of Guggenheim Partners. Subash Chandra : Yeah. Good morning. First question is on, I guess, deflation. Understanding that you're budget for next year and your capital efficiencies aren't dependent on it. I'm curious, if you're seeing any evidence as some of the other operators are slowing down, or at least say they are slowing down. Bill Thomas : Subhash, yes, I think, just in general, the U.S. shale industry, I think, year-over-year production growth is slowing. That's certainly not the case for EOG. I think, we continue to differentiate ourselves by continuing to improve and our well productivity remains very, very strong and robust. We continue to -- as Ezra pointed out, we continue to drill record wells. And we continue to have record drilling times and we're setting new records really literally almost every play on well costs. So the key to success in any business is getting better all the time and lowering your cost and getting your production up and maintaining a very, very strong performance. And I think the EOG culture is quite unique in the business and it really sets EOG apart. Subhash Chandra : Yes. I guess, the question was, do you see cost deflation actually occurring? Bill Thomas : Well, I'll ask Billy to comment specifically on that. Billy Helms : Yes. This is Billy Helms. What we see on the service side, I guess, is the service industry is pretty much at a low. I wouldn't expect to see much further cost reductions on the service side. I think services are at a pretty low price point at this present time. And for them to stay healthy, to be able to service our industry, I think there's not much room to go any lower. So I think the important thing for -- to differentiate, as Bill said, on EOG is that, we're not dependent on service cost to really continue to reduce our well cost. I think that's an important point to make. Our operating teams continue to find ways to drill the wells faster, figure out more efficient completion techniques drive our lease operating costs down to improve our overall economics. And that's really what's driving EOG's continued efficiency gains. Subhash Chandra : Right. Okay. Got you. And then, my follow-up is, I guess, a philosophical question. And acquisitions, you've ruled out corporate. And maybe it's a moot point, because you have so much inventory that you can find organically. But it just seems that the A&D market is at sort of, at least in recent history, historical lows. And the cost of your growth, I think, your slide suggests $30,000, $35,000 for flowing BOE per day. And there's acquisitions there equal to or less than that number. Do you see an opportunity to exploit what hopefully is a temporary divergence in the market? Bill Thomas : So, I think, we want to be really clear on that. We do not envision doing any large M&A, expensive M&A, especially expenses. M&A is -- large M&As are just really not in our game plan. We have tremendous confidence in our organic ability to generate very strong, even better quality inventory than we currently have. And we can do that organically at a much, much lower cost, even compared to what you might think M&A could produce. So our game plan will be continuing to focus on organic growth, low-cost growth, adding inventory that would be additive to the quality that we have and adding that at really low cost. And we believe we can add very much a large amount of inventory that way if we -- I think, we commented that we're looking -- we're operating in six different basins and we have active prospects in 10 different basins ongoing right now. So it's the most robust exploration effort, I've been with the company 40 years, that I've seen in the company. So we've got a lot of confidence in our ability to more than replace and to improve our inventory going forward at very, very low cost. Operator : Next we have Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : Yes. Good morning, Bill, to you and the whole team there. I want to just pick up, maybe, on the points you were just commenting on and try them a little bit differently. Going back to your prepared comments, I think, it was point three on your points to differentiate, you said, you -- for mid-50s oil, you expect to grow -- or, excuse me, mid-50 WTI you grow oil comparable to the rate in -- that you grew in 2019, grow the dividend and then I believe it was also grow free cash flow. And it makes sense that you guys would have better capital efficiency in 2020 than you have in 2019. But can you give me an idea what is that increment that we should be looking for? And did I kind of get that whole setup correct? Bill Thomas : Now, then you're exactly right, Charles. What we said, is -- what we say is that, we can -- we believe, we can deliver mid-teens growth. We can grow the dividend and generate substantial free cash flow with oil at about $55. So we want to continue to operate. Obviously, if you look at the company right now, we're operating in a continual -- a very high level, an optimum level. And we're generating a lot of free cash flow. We're producing really, really strong growth. And if you look over the last two years, we've grown the dividend over 70%. So that's what we want to continue to do in the future. We want to continue to make sure that, first of all, that we're maximizing our returns. Our company's focus has always been on returns and returns come first. And volume growth is just an expression of reinvesting at high returns. So we want to operate at a point, at a level, at a growth level where we continue to get better every year. And so next year, because of the operational momentum, we have this year and the ongoing cost reductions, we see that continuing going into next year. And so, our focus is to get better and to make better returns next year. And that will help us to grow at a very healthy rate and it also help us to generate very substantial free cash flow. And so, we're also focused on the dividend. We want to have -- as we've talked in the past, I think, we've kind of -- a very good indication over the latter of the last two years, with dividend increases of 30% or better per year. And we want to do that going forward. We're not going to commit to the level we're going to increase the dividend specifically, but we want to continue to have strong dividend growth in the future. And so, of course, that all depends on the macro environment what the oil price is and we evaluate that every quarter, our Board does. And we'll make those decisions on a quarterly basis. But our goal is to get our dividend yield up to the 2% yield level as quick as possible. Charles Meade : That's a helpful elaboration. Thank you. And then, if I could ask the follow-up on the Middle Wolfcamp perhaps of Ezra. Ezra, you talked a little bit about -- when you're talking about the Third Bone Spring's in response to an earlier question, how many other wells in the industry had targeted the carbonate and the shale. But do you have a similar sense for how many other industry wells have targeted this section in the Wolfcamp M? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Charles. This is Ezra. I'm glad you asked that question. I was just sitting here trying to figure out if I had actually mentioned that or not. The Wolfcamp Middle, or M, as we call it, it roughly correlates to the Wolfcamp B and part of the C as known by some other operators. And so, really across the Delaware Basin, there have been a few hundred wells drilled in a similar target there. And so we've got -- that's one of the reasons we've looked at all that data, they're landing zones, we've incorporated that with our own data to go ahead and announce this premium play. Charles Meade : Got it. That's what I was after. Thanks Ezra. Operator : Next we have Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Campbell : Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. I thought the supply agreement with Cheniere was both interesting and innovative and it brought up two questions. So the first one is, what sort of long-term price uplift versus Henry Hub do you expect from that portion of your supply that's indexed to the JKM Marker? And second, is this kind of a deal that you're looking at repeating again in the future, maybe with Cheniere or maybe another LNG exporter? Bill Thomas : I'm going to ask Lance to comment on that one. Lance Terveen : Yes Jeff. Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. First, to start off, I mean, it kind of follows up with what Billy talked about. I mean, this new transaction and the gas sales agreements that we've done with Cheniere, it's really consistent with our marketing strategy in how we're trying to diversify our sales points and having multiple options. And really when we undertook this process when you really look at Cheniere, I mean they are the industry leader. I mean if you look at the 7.5 Bcf a day that's being exported today on LNG, they represent 5.5. So expanding our business with them, we're very excited about. And just a reminder that starts at the 140,000 MMBtus a day starting in January of next year and that ramps up to the 440,000. But on your question just on the price realizations as that contract starts up next year, we'll be incorporating that into our guidance. So I'm not going to give any specific color on that. But what I can tell you that's why it got us excited about it is just when you look at the amount of LNG demand growth that's going to be coming on especially over like the next 10 years, it's definitely all in the Asia Pacific region. And so tying it to that and to see especially with significant weather events in those areas it's -- it can provide as you look historically for significant upside. So that's what got us excited about that. And then your last question there just about new structures and new deals. I mean, we're very excited about this first and we're going to stay poised. I think, we're going to continue to watch the market. We're always looking for new opportunities in diversifying our portfolio. So we'll definitely be staying active in the future as we look at new structures that may come in front of us. Jeffrey Campbell : Thanks for that color, Lance. I appreciate it. My other question was earlier in the call there was some discussion of the corporate decline. And slide 49 notes that longer laterals exhibit shallower declines than shorter laterals, and I assume that's a comparison within a given play. I wondered if some of the portfolio plays as a whole exhibit shallower declines than others. And does this help influence attracting capital? Bill Thomas : Yeah, Jeffrey. That decline rate is something that we're very much focused on in the company. And so as we continue to focus our capital and high grade our capital, we do consider that as part of the process. And so we're looking at low decline, lower decline plays particularly in our exploration efforts. Some of the newer plays we've announced in the last several years have lower decline than some of our historical plays. And then we're also looking and focused on lower finding costs. So low finding costs, low decline plays are certainly preferred for us and that's a focus of our exploration effort. And it really is a function of the quality of the rock in combination with the completion technology and they work together to help in that regard. So we're focused on that and that helps the company get better. That's part of the process. We've been going on the last several years. It's helped us get better in the last couple of years; certainly this year and we think that will continue to help us in the future. Operator : And next we have Neal Dingmann of SunTrust. Neal Dingmann : Just want to get through all the details. And you talked a little bit -- I see as you always done on your slide 5 you break out the premium sort of parameters. I guess my question is more around slide 36 and just what caused the changes in both what you were able to add but also to the Eagle Ford Bakken and Woodford, I think that was down a little bit on those. I'm just wondering what contributed to that? Bill Thomas : Billy would you comment on that? Billy Helms : Yeah, I think an important point to take away, Neal is that this represents our best estimate going forward on each play. The Eagle Ford as we've talked about it's an update relative -- taking into account the number of wells we drilled and then what we have remaining. The important point on the Eagle Ford is to recognize as Ken discussed, we have 2,200 remaining locations that we can continue to work on to convert to premium over time as we continue to move into areas that are less developed. So I think that's the upside on the Eagle Ford. The rest of the plays it just represents kind of what we see as the remaining inventory at this point in time for each one of these plays that are mentioned here. And overall it's in keeping with replacing -- more than replacing what we drill every year. Neal Dingmann : Very good. And then Bill maybe just one broad question. I'm just wondering when you look at what's been mentioned today about the growth versus the free cash versus shareholder return, I'm just wondering when you sort of put out there the 15% growth to $55 is your primary delta, kind of, what free cash flow you want to achieve? Or what shareholder return? I'm just wondering how you all go about thinking about that. Bill Thomas : Yeah. Certainly the free cash flow is an important component of it. So it's a balance of allocating capital at the right that we can get better and can increase our returns every year. It is certainly focused on generating substantial free cash flow and continuing to increase the dividend in a very strong manner too. So we want to work on all three of those. And then as you know we have been reducing our debt. And Tim talked about that in the opening remarks. And so we want to continue to pay off those bonds as they mature. So we look at all that but, primarily it's really focusing the capital on generating really strong returns and certainly working on the dividend. Neal Dingmann : Very helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : Next we have Leo Mariani of KeyBanc. Leo Mariani : Hey guys, I fully appreciate that you guys don't have 2020 guidance out there. You certainly talked about the mid-teens oil growth rate at $55 WTI, which sounds great. I guess just from a high level philosophical perspective, in order to kind of achieve that, do you guys think you'd have to increase activity and CapEx at all? Or maybe a little bit to do that? Or do you think the efficiencies are such that you could do that with a similar type of activity? Bill Thomas : I'll ask Billy to comment on that. Billy Helms : Yeah Leo. This is Billy Helms. I think the takeaway would be we're going to be targeting as Bill said how do we continue to improve, what we do. We're not going to give you any specific guidance on how much capital that's going to deploy. We have the capability of increasing activity if the commodity outlook supports that. But we're going to stay extremely flexible at this point in time to make sure that as we go into the next year, we're doing so with the discipline that we want to maintain in each one of our programs. So I guess we certainly have the capability of doing whatever the market shows us that is prudent to do. And our programs will support it. And we have the teams to execute any of those programs. So we'll just, kind of, leave it there for right now. Leo Mariani : Okay. I guess just wanted to see if we can get maybe a little bit more kind of a high-level update on some of the new plays. I certainly realize you guys aren't ready to announce any of the exploration plays but I know you've drilled a number of wells in 2019. Really just wanted to get a sense of whether or not on some of the wells you've drilled you think that you're getting competitive economics even in these early stages here to the point where you can foresee some new premium drilling inventory? Any comments on that? Bill Thomas : I'm going to ask Ezra to comment on that. Ezra Yacob : Yeah, Leo. Thank you for the question. This is Ezra. As we've discussed previously, we're very excited about our exploration program. And Bill had mentioned that we're currently leasing and testing in over 10 different basins across all of our divisions, our focus primarily on oilier plays with higher rock quality that we've applied. We're searching for these plays. We're prospecting for plays that we've applied core and log data in our reservoir models developed from our multi-basin approach. So really leveraging off of our efforts in the Delaware Basin, the Powder River Basin, the Eagle Ford and Woodford oil window to really identify rock quality that will perform very well in combination with our horizontal drilling and completions technology and hopefully deliver slightly shallower declines. And hopefully we'll be very competitive with our current inventory. Again we want to increase the quality of our inventory not just add to the back end. As far as that, we're confident in our reservoir models. And hopefully we'll be able to update you on a future call. Operator : And next we have Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Scott Hanold : Yeah, thanks. You all talked about hitting some of your -- the cost reduction targets this year and it sounds like you've got some new efficiencies you're seeing in place. Is there anything specific you can point out to outside of, hey we're drilling faster but like specifically what's happening on the ground and maybe even from a technological side that's causing that improved uplift? Bill Thomas : Yes, Billy will comment on that. Billy Helms : Yes, Scott. It's not any one specific thing that helps us achieve these improved efficiencies. It goes back to what Bill talked about in his opening comments. It's the culture of the company. It's the drive of every one of our operating teams to continue to get better. And I couldn't be prouder of the execution those guys have made. One example on the drilling side to help us get the wells drilled faster as I mentioned in the prepared remarks the innovations we've made on designing drilling motors that enable us to increase the speed at which we do and the reliability of those tools to keep them in the ground is just one example. There's several examples on the completion side that go along with that to allow us to complete more of the lateral feet per day than we used to a year ago at a much lower cost and still deliver the same productivity improvements that we're seeing as we deliver the production from our wells. So it's just a number of different things. And it's hard for us to capture them all in one call like this, but just to say, that everybody in each division is working hard to try to continue to improve every day. Scott Hanold : Okay, understood. And then if I could try a question on next year's activity just at a high level. I mean it seems like this year if I'm not mistaken you've got around $400 million of that $6.3 billion budget allocated to kind of research development and technological improvements. As you look into 2020 should we expect a very similar amount? Or -- and if I'm not mistaken I thought 2019 was going to be heavier. What does 2020 look like? Billy Helms : Scott, we're not I think ready at this point to give you a specific number on that. But we do certainly have an ongoing exploration and leasing program and so we'll continue to keep that up. But we won't give you a specific number on that. We're still working through all those details. Operator : And next we have Joseph Allman of Baird. Joseph Allman : Thank you. Good morning. My question is on political risk. Bill, EOG has been very good at reducing political risk, for example, not operating in Colorado. What steps might you take to reduce the political risk that you addressed in your slides related to federal acreage? Bill Thomas : Well, I think, as we've talked about I think in the opening remarks we do have a very active permitting process going on. So we're well ahead of that. We have two to four years of permits in hand. And we have the ability to modify our operations and we have a lot of flexibility with the different operating areas and shifting rigs here and there. And so we will -- we have been and we will continue to actively develop our federal acreage position very strongly. So we'll -- we've not really ever I think had a problem working with any of the regulatory changes. We have a great relationship with BLM and a great relationship with the state governments that we are active in. So it all works together. We try to be a good citizen, a good operator. And it really has worked out well for us in the past. Joseph Allman : Thanks, Bill. And then my second question is on the Austin Chalk. What is preventing the Austin Chalk from making it to the list of premier plays? You clearly have many great wells. Do you just not have enough to call it a premier play? Or is it really on the cost side? And you're drilling a couple dozen wells a year. So it would seem to be -- it's at least a great play if not a premier play. Bill Thomas : Yes. Well I think the first thing is when you think about the Austin Chalk, it's a really big play. It goes a long ways. And it's got all different kinds of aspects to it. And we've been very successful in our -- under our Eagle Ford acreage we have great results in the Austin Chalk. And it's certainly an exploration target for us. And we have multiple places in the play that we're looking and testing. And so they keep our competitive advantage on making sure we get the acreage in the right spot. We haven't talked about anything specific. But we will at some point and we'll give you some updates on our progress in the Chalk. Operator : Next we have Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram : Hey, Bill, I wanted to talk to you or ask you about the potential sensitivity to your 2020 program to lower oil prices. I think you outlined a mid-teens oil growth at $55. If oil prices average closer to $50 per barrel would you adjust activity accordingly? And could you discuss broadly the sensitivity to your oil growth rate at a $50 number? Bill Thomas : Well, we can't give you any specifics there Arun. But certainly we would adjust our capital. Again, we want to have great returns. That's numbers one. We want to have strong oil growth. We want to have substantial free cash flow. So we continue to work on the dividend. So we really balance all those. And we would set it appropriately based on our macro view of oil in 2020. And at this point, we don't want to speculate, whether it's going to be higher or lower. We're just trying to give you some guidelines of kind of where we see our efforts next year. Arun Jayaram : Great, great and just a follow-up, I know the reduction in your rig count in the second half has garnered a lot of attention. But it sounds like this decline was driven by rig efficiencies. I guess my question is, in 2019 Bill, you're delivering call it 740 net wells for $6.3 billion, in capital. If we were going to bake in the rig efficiencies, you're seeing today OFS deflation do you have any thoughts on what your CapEx dollar could do incremental to 2019? Could we see another call it 5% to 10% improvement in well cost next year? Bill Thomas : Again Arun, we're not going to give you any specific numbers. So -- but we do certainly believe that, our capital efficiency will improve next year over this year. We definitely believe that our well costs will continue to decrease next year too. So and we're certainly hopeful operating costs will continue to go down. So the company just incrementally is getting better every quarter. And our culture, and our people, and our divisions are just doing a tremendous job in doing that. And so, along with oil prices, we bake all that in and that will really determine what our plan will be. Operator : Next we have Michael Scialla of Stifel. Michael Scialla : Yeah. Good morning, everybody. If you are successful with these new exploration plays, they turn out to generate better returns than even your premium inventory. I just want to see how quickly they could move to the top of the drilling inventory. And if they're not just additive, would that allow you to actually replace some inventory to where you could look at monetizing some of the inventory that's maybe at the end of the spectrum? Bill Thomas : Yeah. And Michael thank you for your question, yeah the plays, the ones we're looking at these 10 different basins, most of them are in areas, where we could increase activity reasonably fast not jump in with 10 rigs in one year. But we could incrementally I think add rigs to each one of these plays and develop the infrastructure. They're not in -- most of them are not in places where you couldn't do that fairly quickly. So, if they were incremental to our returns, we would certainly move that way on each one of them as quickly as possible. And we have a lot of inventory obviously in the company. And we have sold, I think about $6 billion -- over $6 billion of properties over the last 10 years. And we'll continue to look to get value through possibly monetizing, any of that. But we don't think they'll ever get to a premium category. So, certainly that would be another avenue to add value to the company. Michael Scialla : Okay. Thanks. And then, Bill you mentioned last quarter you were pleased with those first three Niobrara wells in the Powder. And then it looks like you added another one this quarter.  One of your nearby competitors had some favorable things to say about the Niobrara this quarter. I just want to see, how you're viewing that zone relative to the other targets in the Powder River Basin. Bill Thomas : I'm going to ask Billy to comment on that. Billy Helms : Yeah. I think we're very pleased with the early results we're seeing from the Niobrara play. It's -- it looks to be something that we had hoped for. It's going to be more of an oily play in that Powder River Basin that we can grow oil volumes. And be competitive with the rest of our inventory. And we're going at a pace now, that's really dictated by the learning's that we're taking into account, but also the infrastructure we have there now. And as we've mentioned in earlier calls, the pace of activity will be really married up with our level of spending on infrastructure to grow that play. But it looks to be a play that we can see us growing another leg of growth that we'll have in the future. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference call back over to, Mr. Thomas for his closing remarks, Sir? Bill Thomas : Yeah. So I'd just like to say that again, we're just so pleased with another outstanding performance by EOG in the third quarter. And we want to say many thanks to everyone in the company for making it happen. They're doing a fantastic job. The company continues to improve in every area. Our costs continue to fall. Oil well results are very strong. Capital efficiency continues to improve. And our premium inventory continues to grow. So our high-return organic growth machine is running at the most optimum level in the company's history. And most importantly, we're very excited about performing at an even higher level in 2020. So again, thank you for listening. And thank you for your support. Operator : And we thank you sir and to the rest of the management team for your time also today. Again, the conference call is now concluded. Again, we thank you all for attending today's presentation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines. Thank you. Just take care. And have a great day, everyone.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day everyone and welcome to EOG Resources Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir. Tim Driggers : Thank you and good morning. Thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing fourth quarter and full-year 2019 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions, as well as reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential, not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to US investors that appears at the bottom of our earnings release issued yesterday. Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP Exploration and Production; Ezra Yacob, EVP Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor and Public Relations. For the call this morning, we want to cover three topics. First, Bill Thomas will review the characteristics of EOG that have contributed to our long-term sustainable success; second, I will discuss our financial strategy; and third Billy Helms will review the outstanding 2019 operating performance and the 2020 plan. Here's Bill Thomas. Bill Thomas : Thanks Tim, and good morning everyone. In times of uncertainty, EOG's sustainable business model is well suited to navigate a volatile environment. In fact, we are more confident in EOG's future today than we've ever been in the history of the Company. With our strong balance sheet and flexibility, EOG is better positioned now, both financially and operationally to weather the storms than it's ever been in the past. Our operational performance last year was the best in the Company history, and we believe EOG's performance in 2020 will be even better than 2019. With an industry-leading return on capital employed of 12% in 2019, we beat our plan in every respect. Capital spending was below plan, volumes were over plan, and per unit operating expenses declined more than forecast. We grew oil production at a lower cost per barrel than ever before and delivered on our goal of double-digit returns and double-digit growth in a modest oil price environment. The Company also generated nearly $1.9 billion of free cash flow, defined as our discretionary cash flow less our total cash capital expenditures. That cash flow funded the retirement of $900 million of debt and the payment of $588 million in dividends. We accomplished all this with oil prices averaging $57 a barrel. Today, due to our confidence in the future performance of the Company, we are increasing the dividend again for the third year in a row by another 30%. With this increase, our dividend has more than doubled since 2017 and represents an annual return of cash to shareholders of more than $800 million in 2020. Our confidence in this Company's future is based on two unique characteristics of EOG. The first is our culture and the second is our premium investment standard. These two qualities drive our Company and give EOG a unique and sustainable competitive advantage. EOG's culture is the foundation of our long-term success. First and foremost, we are return-focused which drives disciplined capital allocation. Our decentralized organization supports an entrepreneurial mindset to drive bottom-up value creation. We embrace technology and innovation to make better wells for lower cost. Counter intuitively, our capital efficiency improves year after year, because we don't consider this a manufacturing process. We pride ourselves on being a responsible operator, good to employees, our communities, our partners and our vendors. We embrace technology and innovation in every aspect of the Company, including reducing our environmental footprint. EOG's culture is our Number 1 competitive advantage and has driven our strong historical success and we are confident it will continue to drive success in the future. The second unique characteristic of EOG is our premium investment standard, which is rooted in our return-focused culture. The premium well strategy dictates that a well isn't a well unless it earns at least 30% return at an oil price of $40. Requiring our hurdle rate of 30% for direct capital ensures that once full cost is applied, we earn a healthy double-digit all-in return. We believe our premium standard is one of the most strict investment hurdle rates in the industry and positions EOG to be one of the lowest cost producers in the global energy market. Our premium inventory is growing faster than we drill it and the quality of the wells we are adding to the inventory is improving. To illustrate this point, after three years of adding premium inventory, our medium premium well today, actually yields a direct a-tax rate of return of over 55% at $40 flat oil prices. With a $50 oil price, the median return soars to more than 80%. The combination of our ability to replace and improve our inventory while continuously lowering cost at the same time is why we are so excited and confident about EOG's future. Premium drilling delivers exceptional capital efficiency that has allowed EOG in a modest oil price environment to grow oil volumes at strong double-digit rates and generate significant free cash flow at the same time, a financial profile that is competitive with the best companies in the S&P 500. For 2020, our goal is to continue to create significant shareholder value through discipline investment and high-return premium wells, while ensuring the capital program and dividend payments can be funded at a conservative oil price. In response to lower oil prices, we reduced capital allocation to premium drilling and oil production growth versus 2019. However, we did not slow down investments in projects that we believe will improve the future of the Company. These include drilling and testing a number of new large plays to improve our inventory, building infrastructure to lower operational costs, and investing in projects that will lower future GHG emissions. It's important to note that our 2020 all-in capital efficiency, including infrastructure and exploration is better than 2019, consistent with our commitment to getting better every year. At an oil price of less than $50, our disciplined capital plan of $6.5 billion supports growth in crude oil production of 12%, sets the Company up for better returns in the future and comfortably funds the dividend. Finally, we want to review our environmental, social and governance performance. We made significant progress last year in both our ESG disclosure and more importantly our ESG performance. EOG is one of the lowest flaring intensity rates in the industry as recently reported by the Texas Railroad Commission. We're very excited about the level of innovation and degree of focus in the Company to drive further environmental improvements. We continue to expand our water reuse technology throughout the Company. We've been a leader in the use of electric frac fleets and continue to electrify our operations, replacing diesel generation where feasible. We are piloting the use of alternative energy sources such as solar to power compressors and reduce GHG emissions. And last but certainly not least, all these projects are expected to earn returns. We are optimistic that most, if not all of these efforts, and many others will help lower our GHG emissions intensity. To sum up, we hope you can see why we're so confident about EOG's future. Our unique culture and premium investment strategy, our competitive advantages that will drive our long-term operational, financial, and environmental performance and together underpin our long-term sustainable success. Next up is Tim to review our 2019 financial performance and long-term financial outlook. Tim Driggers : Thanks Bill. EOG had outstanding financial performance in 2019, demonstrating the resiliency of our business. Our 2019 return on capital employed was 12% with oil averaging $57 per barrel for the year and with meaningfully lower NGL and natural gas prices compared to 2018. EOG generated discretionary cash flow for the full year of $8.1 billion and invested $6.2 billion in exploration and development expenditures, resulting in full-year free cash flow of $1.9 billion. Proceeds from asset sales in 2019 contributed an additional $140 million. We paid $588 million in dividends and retired $900 million in debt. Cash on the balance sheet at year end was $2 billion and total debt was $5.2 billion for a net debt-to-total cap ratio of 13%, down from 19% at the end of 2018. The power of our premium well strategy can be seen in our financial performance for the last three years. We established the premium hurdle rate in 2016 and the strategies began paying off the very next year. Beginning in 2017, we have averaged 14% return on capital employed, a return measure that can be directly calculated from our financial statements using GAAP earnings; generated nearly $4.6 billion of free cash flow while growing US oil production by 64%; paid out $1.4 billion in dividends or 30% of free cash flow; and retired nearly $1.9 billion in debt, cutting our debt-to-cap ratio by more than half from 28% to 13%. Our focus at EOG is creating long-term shareholder value. The clearest way to realize this goal is to grow the business value of our Company over time while at the same time protecting that value through commodity price cycles. How do we do this? We compound attractive corporate level returns through disciplined growth while ensuring the Company remains profitable in lower commodity price environments. We analyze the model of the Company under numerous scenarios and the outcome from each of them is clear. By reinvesting and growing, EOG generates higher ROCE, higher cash flow, and higher free cash flow in the future and ultimately higher business value. The most tangible output of this strategy is the payment of a regular dividend. The payment of a growing sustainable dividend is the best way to return cash to shareholders and is an integral part of our successful business model, high-return reinvestment. EOG's dividend growth has grown at a compound annual rate of 22% over the last 20 years. I'm pleased to say we have never cut the dividend and never issued equity to support it. In the past three years, the adoption of our premium strategy has dramatically increased the capacity to pay a sustainable dividend in a volatile commodity environment and EOG has responded with healthy increases. We analyze the amount of the dividend under many scenarios. There is no simple formula. But one way you can think about it is consider the financial profile of the Company under various oil price environments. This is illustrated on Slide 9 of the investor presentation. In 2020, maintenance CapEx of $4.1 billion plus the dividend can be funded at an oil price of $40 per barrel. Maintenance CapEx is the amount of capital required to fund drilling as well as infrastructure requirements to keep oil production flat, relative to 2019 across all premium oil plays. Our premium strategy has dramatically lowered the cost structure, improved the capital efficiency of the Company and increased the capacity to pay a sustainable dividend. We are proud of the performance that allowed us to reward shareholders with sustainable dividends of more than 30% in the last three years. Looking ahead, the Board of Directors will ultimately evaluate the amount of the dividend each year, based on business conditions at the time and expectations for the future. Our goal remains the same, pay a growing sustainable dividend that represents a tangible return to shareholders from long-term value creation. Next up is Billy to review our operational performance. Billy Helms : Thanks, Tim. Let me first start by saying that I'm extremely proud of the efforts and achievements of our talented employees for their tremendous execution in 2019. EOG delivered more oil for less capital in all four quarters of 2019. For the full year, we increased US oil production 15%, producing 5,000 barrels of oil per day more than we initially estimated at the start of 2019 with CapEx that was near the low end of the guidance. We achieved this with four fewer rigs and two fewer completion spreads than originally planned. Driven by efficiency improvements across our operation, total well cost declined 7% in 2019. Internally generated improvements came from every area of our operations, sparked by innovation from EOG's creative, decentralized organization. In our drilling operations, a good example is our premium drilling motor program. The program implemented in the Permian, led to a 50% reduction in motor failures in 2019, generating a cost savings of $20,000 per well. We are now implementing this program in the Rockies and Mid-Continent areas, joining the Eagle Ford, which has had a similar program for some time. Our drilling teams are also delivering performance improvements more consistently, which reduces downtime. As a result, our drilling times improved 17% across our 36-rig program. Our completion teams also delivered outstanding improvements in 2019 due to the employment of electric frac fleets and the use of diverter material. As a result, overall well performance increased and completion costs were down 15%. Our drilling and completion advancements last year were the primary reason we delivered higher production with lower capital cost expenditures. CapEx savings driven by well cost improvements in 2019 allowed us to invest more money in infrastructure projects and acreage acquisitions than the original plan. Investments in infrastructure like water handling systems have very high rates of return and payback quickly often within months and acquiring low cost acreage in our new exploration prospects will enable the Company to sustain the growth well into the future. Operating expenses also improved significantly in 2019, especially per unit LOE cost, which declined by 6% for the full year and a whopping 13% in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the fourth quarter 2018. Savings from infrastructure investments supported these improvements. Use of diversion material in our completion designs was another driver of operating expense improvement. Diverter mitigates the risk of sand and water incursion into offset wells, reducing work-over expense. We had some great accomplishments in 2019 in our environmental and safety performance as well. Most importantly, we reduced the recordable incident rate by nearly 30%. We decreased our use of freshwater. For the total company, 75% of the water sourced from reuse was non-freshwater sources - 75% of the water sourced from reuse or non-freshwater sources decreased fresh water consumption by more than 25% versus the previous year. In the Permian, 98% of the water was from reuse or non-fresh water sources, reducing the freshwater consumed by more than 60%. We achieved a wellhead gas capture rate of over 98% across the Company, including the Permian Basin, performance we think places EOG among industry leaders. Now, just to comment on our reserves. Our 2019 capital program yielded more than 250% reserve replacement at a low finding cost of just $8.21 per BOE, excluding revisions due to commodity price changes. That finding cost is 12% lower than 2018. As a result, our proved reserves increased by 401 million barrels of oil equivalent or 14% year-over-year to 3.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Our permanent shift to premium drilling, focused on efficiencies driven by innovation and our unique culture while our capital efficiency continues to improve and how we've lowered our corporate finding cost to less than $8.50 per barrel of oil equivalent. The marketing team also did a phenomenal job last year to position EOG to capture the highest prices for our products, bypassing pinch points while avoiding the kinds of long-term, expensive commitments that narrow profit margins and constrain operational flexibility. In 2019, EOG sold its first cargoes of crude oil into the export market and we will build on that success in 2020 as our long-term export capacity for crude oil and natural gas continues to expand. In 2020, we will be able to successfully transport nearly all of our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs out of the basins where they are produced to capture the highest prices in the domestic markets while also accessing export markets for all these products for the first time. Looking ahead into our 2020 capital plan, due to the commodity uncertainty and - due to the current uncertainty in commodity prices, we reduced capital allocated to oil growth. However, we have allocated capital to fund investments that will continue to improve the Company, such as drilling to test and bring forward new play drilling potential that will improve the quality of our inventory, infrastructure to lower cost, and environmental projects to lower GHG emissions and increase water recycling. The plan allows us to accomplish several key objectives. One, our capital efficiency improves over last year. Our goal is to continue to get better every year and our premium strategy continues to transform the financial and operational efficiency of the Company. In fact, our capital efficiency is strong enough to carry the additional capital allocated to exploration and infrastructure, which will continue to improve future drilling returns, lower cash operating cost and lower the breakeven price needed to generate 10% ROCE. Number two, the plan is balanced at $50 oil, meaning we can fund capital expenditures and pay the dividend with discretionary cash flow. To be clear, we have a tremendous amount of flexibility to adjust our activity levels as we see how the commodity landscape plays out. Should we see oil prices continue to trend lower over the sustained period of time, we would reduce our activity and capital budget in order to generate free cash flow. At higher prices, we would not increase activity and our 2020 plan generates significant free cash flow. Number three, we are allocating capital to several key new exploration projects. Our 2020 program includes multiple exploration wells in at least six new plays along with additional leasing of low cost acreage. We are confident that our exploration efforts will add future high-return growth potential to our already deep inventory. And number four, we anticipate continued improvements in our operational efficiencies. We lowered well costs 7% last year and have set an initial goal to lower our well cost another 4%. We also expect to reduce LOE by another 2%. Our operating teams are highly focused on capturing additional efficiency gains in each area of our operation, and we anticipate that there will be some additional savings from service pricing as well. It's important to note that none of - that we have not included these potential savings in our 2020 plan. Finally, we are starting 2020 off just like we did in 2019, with CapEx slightly weighted to the first half of the year. We had excellent results in 2019 and we are confident that we will continue to continue that performance into 2020. We allocated capital to Trinidad infrastructure and environmental projects early in the year to allow the most benefit to this year's economics. We will continue to monitor the commodity markets and make adjustments to ensure we meet our objectives of generating free cash flow and solid returns. We have a great deal of flexibility to adjust as needed. Because of our decentralized organizational structure, multi-play portfolio, and deeply ingrained culture that fosters innovation, continuous improvement and growth, I'm highly confident EOG can sustain our success well into the future. Now here's Bill to wrap up. Bill Thomas : Thanks, Billy. In closing, I will leave you with these thoughts. First, our 2020 plan is set to perform even stronger than 2019. With improved capital efficiency, we are set to deliver strong high-return growth and investments that will strengthen the future of the Company. We are particularly excited about cost reduction and drilling a significant number of wells on several new large exploration plays that we believe will continue to improve our inventory. We see no end to improving the Company in 2020. Second, EOG's unique return-focused and innovative culture has proven for decades to deliver significant shareholder value. Our culture continues to improve and we'll continue to drive our future success. Third, our strict premium investment hurdle is the most stringent in the industry and a significant and unique competitive advantage that allows EOG to be one of the lowest cost operators in the global energy market. And finally, EOG has positioned better than ever to be the leader in ROCE and deliver double-digit growth with significant free cash flow through the commodity cycles. We are more confident and excited about our future now than we've ever been before. Thanks for listening and now we'll go to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate : And Bill, may I say thank you for the disclosure on sustaining capital that we've been asking for. It makes life a lot more transparent and a lot easier for us to figure out how we think about valuations so appreciate that on Slide 9 of your deck. My question is on the inventory. I guess, the Slides 12 and 13, again terrific disclosure, but can you just help us understand how - what the process is, excuse me - what the process is to translate the - I think you called it conversion potential of some 5,000 locations and what that visibility looks like longer term, because the only knock on your stock now that we constantly here is, while as you continue to grow and increase the pace, that inventory life is going to shrink. So, applying some kind of annuity valuation becomes problematic unless you've got that visibility. So, what is the process and what is the debt, I guess, is the question. Bill Thomas : Yes, our inventory, when I think about EOG's inventory life, it's probably last on my list of things to worry about I'd say because the Company has just historically and continues to be a prolific generator of inventory. And since we started premium in 2016, we've just steadily increased the inventory up and currently it's 10,500 locations and we have an additional 5,000 locations that really are just on the verge of converting into premium. And I'm going to ask Ezra to give a little bit more color on about how we do this and then maybe talk about some of our additional inventory through our exploration. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Doug. This is Ezra. Thanks for the question. As Bill pointed out, we have identified 10,500 premium locations right now which at our current pace of drilling represents about 13 years of drilling and then those 5,000 locations that you both pointed out with the conversion potential would add another six years at the current pace. So, going back to the conversion potential, I think, as Billy noted in the opening remarks, this past year, we were able to reduce well costs across the Company by approximately 7% and that's really the number one driver of converting those well locations and that's something we've done over the past four years is be able to lower well cost every year through not just reduced contract pricing, but dominantly through our increased operational efficiency and applying innovative technologies and capturing different parts of the value chain. So, that's the first way that we look to expand the inventory, the premium inventory. The second thing we do, which is a bit more challenging, of course, is through our exploration effort and that's an organic exploration effort where we're currently trying to add not only additional premium locations. We've really improved the quality of the locations. So as you mentioned on Slide 12, we've shown what the medium rate of return of our current premium well inventory is there at 58% rate of return on that premium price deck of $40 flat oil, $2.50 natural gas. So, what we're trying to do is really increase that and we're currently for the past 12 months to 18 months we've been leasing in - across 10 different prospects and as Billy mentioned in the opening remarks, we look to be testing about six of those this year and we're very excited about the progress of those exploration prospects and the potential that they could add to the inventory. Doug Leggate : Thanks for the detailed answer guys. My immediate part B to that real quick, the maintenance capital number, what's the decline rate that goes with that? Bill Thomas : I'll ask Billy to comment on that. Billy Helms : It's - yes, the decline on the base production's 32%, Doug. Doug Leggate : So my follow-up then is just a real quick one. Billy, it's also for you, I guess, because you talked about you wouldn't increase spending in a higher oil price environment. Well, I guess, the question that kind of follows from that is, are we seeing then a reset in your sort of base planning assumptions for the commodity because even we believe your stock is very undervalued here and I wonder if share buybacks becomes a consideration at some point. Billy Helms : Yes, Doug. This is Billy. I may give you some thoughts and then maybe Bill want to answer, but since you directed the question to me, I guess, yeah, the point is that we're going to stay disciplined on our capital program. So, we'll certainly adjust downward if commodity prices show that this is going to last for a sustained period of time, but if they do rebound, we will not outspend our capital that we've allocated for this year and we're going to stay disciplined with that. And the reason is, we're going to - as we've stated in the past, we only continue to fund at a point which we can continue to get better. We have a lot of different agendas to try to improve this year and including the exploration projects we talked about and many of the other projects we've got under way, and we certainly want to see those through. So, if oil prices suddenly jump way up, we're not going to rush out and increase capital. So, our plan is really set based on conservative outlook at the time we set the plan and that's not going to change as we go through the year. Bill Thomas : Yes, Doug, I'll just comment on your question about would we consider share buybacks and just reiterate our priorities really have not changed. Number one, as Tim talked about, the best way to create business value is there's no question about it anyway, you want to run it, is reinvesting a high rates of return and that's what we're committed to and that's what we really want to stay focused on. The next priority is sustaining and growing the dividend and we believe the dividend is the best way to return cash to shareholders over the long term and obviously we have been - demonstrated a very, very strong commitment to that this year and previous year. So, that's the way that we want to continue to focus on returning cash to shareholders. Operator : And our next question will come from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Arun Jayaram : Yes, Bill, I was wondering if you could comment on how EOG is thinking about some of the demand impacts from the coronavirus and the state of the oil market today and what would be the Company's game plan if we did move into an environment where we have sustained oil prices caught in the low $40s for some bit of time? Bill Thomas : Yes, Arun, certainly this is a huge world event and it's developing and we like everybody else is watching really daily the developments around the world and we certainly hope and pray it's a short-term event, but if it turned to a longer-term of that, as Billy said, we're in a fantastic position, Number 1. We got a great balance sheet and we are committed to that and that's certainly been a strength of EOG for years and years and years. And so, that puts us in a great position. And then, we're very flexible. We have an operational ability to adjust activity and I think I'll let Billy comment a little bit more about that, maybe some of the specifics. Billy Helms : Yes, Arun. So, the way I would add to that is we have the capability to adjust our rig activity and frac fleets down to really be in line with our sustainable CapEx or our maintenance capital numbers. So, we set out a plan that really allows us to capture the highest performing rigs and frac crews in the market, but we have a tremendous amount of flexibility to adjust downward if we need to. And so - and the same would apply to our allocation of capital to our infrastructure spend and another things. We have the same capability to adjust that downward if needed. So, we'd just be patient here and watch to see how the market unfolds and adjust accordingly. Arun Jayaram : Bill, in your prepared comments you talked about some of the infrastructure spend, which is designed to lower your operating cost. I was wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more color on the magnitude and the level of these investments. What exactly are you investing in on the infrastructure side? Bill Thomas : Yes, the infrastructure is just very critical to build out that infrastructure ahead of the drilling, because it has significant well cost reduction and which certainly increases returns. It has a significant influence on lowering operating costs significantly also and it allows us to, I think, certainly market our products and get our products online, reduce flaring, just all kinds of tremendous benefits. So, really important to stay ahead of that. And maybe Billy you want - you can give a little bit more color on some of the specifics. Billy Helms : Yes. On the specific side of that, Arun, as Bill mentioned, there is a lot of things that we'd like to fund and I would - all of these projects have a direct impact not only on our capital cost in the future of our drilling program, but also lowering our unit operating costs. So, I would point you to Slide 16 in our deck that shows in the last several years, we've reduced our cash operating expense tremendously, 33% percent since 2014. A large part of that decrease came from investment in infrastructure. It allows, even as Ezra talked earlier about our inventory and our ability to convert these wells to premium, part of that cost goes back to investing in infrastructure. So, there are things like the most economic part of that would be getting trucks off the road and reducing our transportation cost, getting water on pipe, oil and gas infrastructure in place, well ahead of the drilling program so that we minimize not only our capital cost for that upcoming year and future years, but also the biggest impact on lowering our full year's LOE and certainly our transportation costs. So, that's largely what it entails. Operator : The next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Neal Dingmann : Morning, Bill and team. My first question's on your 2020 plan, specifically, how fluid is your allocation to the various high-return plays along with how actively you might change your well spacing and other development plans based on what the commodity prices do? Bill Thomas : Neil, this is Bill. On the last point, I don't think we would change spacing that much based on the commodity prices, really, we're already basing our economics on all of our drilling on $40 flat oil. So, we're - even with a drop in price, we're still have a very strict reinvestment hurdle. So, that part we wouldn't really change too much. As far as the plays, the reason it's really easy for us to, I guess, ramp down activity is that we're in multiple plays. We're developing six plays out of multiple divisions. So, you just take one rig per play which is an easy reduction out of each play. It's really easy to do and it makes it really fluid. If you can take two rigs out of each play, that's 12 rig. So we haven't - because of our decentralized organization and multiple plays, it's not that difficult to systematically reduce as the commodity price changes. Neal Dingmann : No, that makes sense. And then my second question, Bill, for you or the team is just on infrastructure. You all suggest in the release that you would allocate a bit more to infrastructure. I'm just wondering, will there come a time down the road where your infrastructure reaches a size where you can consider monetizing or does this remain too critical in keeping your costs lower? Bill Thomas : I'll ask Billy to comment on that one. Billy Helms : Yes, I would say that the infrastructure is just a critical component of our development activities on a go-forward basis and it really doesn't make sense for us economically or financially to monetize that because it is a big part. As I mentioned earlier, it's a big part of driving our unit costs down and improving our returns long term. So, we plan to - we look at each case independently to see where it makes sense for us to invest in that infrastructure versus others and a large part of that goes back to our need to control how we get those products to market also to capture the biggest prices in not only domestic markets, but also be able to export that as we need to. Operator : The next question is from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer : My first question's on the Eagle Ford shale. There has been much made about the shift from east to west within the portfolio and concerns over falling EURs. On Slide 42, you highlight the extent to which in well costs were lower in the Eagle Ford, which arguably offset some of that last year about 11% well cost reduction. In 2020, your target for well cost reductions is a bit more modest at 4%. And so, wanted to ask how you see well productivity playing out in the Eagle Ford in 2020 and your outlook for the trajectory for capital efficiency there. Bill Thomas : Yes Brian. Thank you for the question on the Eagle Ford. I think the main thing that's really important on the Eagle Ford is that due to the dramatic cost reductions we continue to have there, our economics remain very, very, very strong. And so, Ken's the expert on the Eagle Ford. I am going to ask him to comment on specifics there. Ken Boedeker : Yes, Brian. As we've moved to the west over the last few years, we've continued to lower the cost basis in the Eagle Ford and improve our returns. If you look at the cost basis, so everything that it takes us to find, develop, produce and market our oil there, you can see that cost basis has continued to reduce even though our percentage to the - going to the West has increased by several percent over the last few years. Out in the West, it's less structurally complex so we're able to drill longer wells and as we bring our cost reductions into that area along with our improved targeting and better completion strategies, we expect those costs to continue to reduce. Our field crew there in the Eagle Ford is just doing an outstanding job in driving those costs down. Brian Singer : And so when net-net in 2020 then, just a follow-up - just - do you continue to see at or better capital efficiency when you think about the cost reduction potential and then how you see your well performance? Ken Boedeker : Yes, we would expect to see actually better capital efficiency in 2020 than we saw '19 in the Eagle Ford. Brian Singer : Great, thanks. And then my follow up is with regards to acreage acquisitions. You talked about that and some capital being earmarked for that this year again. Can you characterize what stage you're in there, the acreage that you - or the capital that you're earmarking, is that capital that is for - based on well results that you know of that are already meeting your return thresholds or is this acreage that is essentially being bought in advance of testing? And then, one of the items that's also on your list for use of excess cash is premium property additions and perhaps you can give an update on how that market looks. Bill Thomas : Brian, I'm going to ask Ezra to comment on the acreage. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Brian. This is Ezra. As far as the acreage in the exploration plays, we really spent, I think, as I just mentioned the last 12 months to 18 months putting together acreage in what we consider to be the highest quality kind of the Tier 1, if you will, parts of these exploration plays and we've been doing that at relatively low cost, really, well under $1,000 per acre I'd say across all of those plays. And we've gotten at least six of those plays as we mentioned to a point where there will still be some additional acreage to put together, but we're at the point on those plays where we plan on drilling and testing those this year. And then, we will still be leasing across some of the other exploration plays as well and, obviously, with these exploration plays, just to keep our competitive advantage up, Brian, I don't want to say too much more than that. Bill Thomas : Yes, Brian, as far as the maybe bolt-on acquisitions, we really don't plan on doing any significant bolt-ons this year, maybe as a few little really small ones in our exploration plays, but with the commodity prices what they are, we're going to be really careful with cash and make sure that we focus it on things that are going to generate super high returns. Operator : The next question will come from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Leo Mariani : Just wanted to get a sense of whether or not in this type of market, which clearly has been quite weak, it feels a little bit like 2016 right now. Whether or not you guys would take advantage of your strong balance sheet to maybe look at some chunkier bolt-on M&A type situations like you did with the Yates back then. Bill Thomas : Yes, I think we just talked about that. No, we don't really have any big plans to do any bolt-on or larger deals. We've been very fortunate as Ezra talked about. Over the last year and a half we've accreted a significant amount of acreage in a number of what we think are very, very high quality plays and we have accreted that at very low cost per acre. And so, we're going to be focused on testing those this year. How we increase in the exploration spend this year is all in drilling. So, we're really set up to test those this year and we're excited about adding new higher quality potential and improving our inventory through our exploration efforts. Leo Mariani : And I guess just with respect to the well cost reductions, looks like you guys beat your target last year 5%, came in at 7%, new target here at 4% in 2020. Just wanted to get a sense of where do you kind of see as the high level kind of big drivers and I guess none of this is service costs in terms of what can lead to those cost reductions here in '20. Bill Thomas : I am going to ask Billy to comment on that one. Billy Helms : There are several factors. It's not one single thing as you ought to imagine. We're seeing certainly some softness in the tubular side. We'll be probably be about 8% lower on tubulars this year relative to last year. Certainly on the completion side of the business, that's probably the area of the biggest decreases we'll see this year and a large - part of that still is on sand cost that could be down again this year just due to mainly getting sand even closer to the wellhead than we did last year. And we are even seeing some softness in drilling rig rates. So, the biggest thing though, I think, that's going to drive that is just our continued push. So, those all were service-related issues. The biggest cost drivers will be on efficiency gains. We just continue to get better and better at everything we do, drilling wells much faster, the use of diverter, improving our completion efficiencies and lowering our well cost, those things all drive the biggest majority of our savings year-over-year. Operator : And our next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Two quick question. I think, Billy you have said that you may, if in the event that you need to reduce the activity level that you could be very easy to just maybe take out one rig per play, but is that the plan or that you will be more looking at, say, a particular play you're going to see more of the one or two is going to be target first or that you will be targeting on the infrastructure that we saw development spending? Bill Thomas : Yes, if I understand the question, Paul, you're asking where would we reduce, would there be any specific plays that we would reduce more other or we would maybe look at infrastructure reduction? Billy can you comment? Paul Cheng : That's correct. Billy Helms : This is Billy. Just to give you a sense, we have a lot of flexibility in all areas. So, we would look at each part of our plan and accordingly adjust as we need to. So, it would be not only just drilling. It could be infrastructure projects as well. And we like to get out ahead of the drilling just to put in the infrastructure to maximize their benefit, but if we slowed down drilling in an area, we will certainly slow down infrastructure spend as well. So, that's one way to think about it. As far as one play relative to the other, as Bill mentioned earlier, it's really easy to adjust each play down and we'll certainly make those decisions when we see the market unfold. So, as we mentioned earlier, we'll just be patient and kind of watch to see what happens before we start making any adjustments. Paul Cheng : The second question just, I think, the Cheniere LNG export term just starting up soon. So, can you tell us that, I mean, how much you pay for the toll and that the physical terms there? - going to get ramped to the 440 million cubic feet per day. Ezra Yacob : First off, related to the contractual terms just due to the confidentiality, we can't disclose that, but I can walk you through a little bit of when that started up. So, we actually did start with Cheniere. We're excited about that and we actually had our first lifting on January 20. And so, that is 140 million a day that will be linked JKM. So that's started up in January. And then that will ramp up to 440 million a day with 300 million of that being linked to Henry Hub. So, that's currently what's in place today. Operator : Our next question will come from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Scott Gruber : Yes, just coming back to the infrastructure question that some of your spend on facilities G&P and environmental projects to be about 20% of the total this year. How should we think about that over time? Where to kind of go at some of these strategic investment slate? Bill Thomas : Yes, Billy will comment on that, Scott. Billy Helms : We typically budget every year the overall infrastructure for our facilities in G&P. It's usually about 15% to 20% of our typical plan and this year we've allocated a little bit more closer to the 20% number as you just mentioned and that varies year to-year depending on where we are in the development of each play and our need for infrastructure to expand those plays and get our cost reductions that we anticipate. So this particular year, it's a little closer to the high end, but I think in general, it's usually between 15% and 20%. Scott Gruber : And then, appreciate the disclosure on the maintenance CapEx. How should we think about the infrastructure percentage within that figure? Billy Helms : It would probably... Bill Thomas : Go ahead. Billy Helms : Yes, it would probably be on the low end of that number, 15% to 20% that I mentioned earlier would be on the low end of that. Certainly we would - focusing on our core areas where we have a little need for additional infrastructure expansion and that would just remind you that that's a maintenance capital number for this year based on keeping this year's number flat. Operator : The next question comes from Joseph Allman with Baird. Joseph Allman : So, on the dividend, what analysis do you do to determine that the dividend is sustainable and to determine how much to increase it. I know Tim commented on this earlier, but like how many years do you look out, three years, five years, 10 years or more and what are the factors that you model and what type of stress testing do you do? Bill Thomas : Yes, we'll ask Tim to comment on that. Tim Driggers : Yes, when we model it, we model it on several different scenarios, but as far as how far out we look, we look out about five years because that's really about as far as you can look out as far as the strip goes to get an idea of what - how to model commodity prices and we stress test it on just about every metric you can imagine, to come up with a recommendation to the Board on where to move the dividend. And so then, as you can imagine, there is a lots of discussion around all that analysis and the Board either agrees with us or doesn't and then we move forward with that increase. Joseph Allman : That's helpful, Tim. And then, on Slide 9, the maintenance CapEx slide, I assume that that's a dynamic metric. So, could you describe how that might change over the next few years? Bill Thomas : We'll ask Billy to comment on that. Billy Helms : So, it's important to understand how we come up with the maintenance capital number to start with. It's a very detailed bottoms-up approach, starting with this year's plan, our 2020 plan and then scaling that down in each one of our plays to make sure we maintain kind of flat growth in each one of our premium plays. So, that's kind of the approach. So each year certainly, depending on what our volumes were, would determine what that level of maintenance capital would be needed to replace or at least maintain the prior-year's production number. So again, this number would fluctuate just depending on what kind of target we're trying to hit, but we would approach it the same way. And then that - it's pretty important to note too that that covers both capital and the dividend at $40. So, it's a pretty good number. It just demonstrates the improvement in our capital efficiencies and basically, this assumes also that we don't see any improvements in either our production performance or additional gains and lowering well cost. So, it's taking the existing conditions as we have today. Operator : Our next question will be from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Bob Brackett : You mentioned that inventory was last on the list of things that you worry about. Could you go to the top of that list and talk about the things specific to EOG that you worry about? Bill Thomas : Well, Bob, of course, oil prices would be number one. It's always number one. So, that's the most difficult part in our volatile environment that we deal with. Really, the Company is in such fantastic shape, I don't really spend a lot of time up at night worried about the direction of the Company. As we said, we've got tremendous confidence in our ability to really continue to have very, very, very good success. And the main - and the reason is simply what we stated before is our culture. I mean we have a - I think a very unique incredible culture and the bottom and the value of the Company is bottom-up driven. It's not me driving it. It's not me making decisions on where to drill the wells or how do get the costs down. It's literally every person in the Company is a business person and we give them - they have the data. They have the ability to analyze it and make decisions, and it's just really the results that we have in the Company are very sustainable because they come from a 1,000 different places. And so, that takes the pressure off of me and it really is just a fantastic organization. So, that really is the basis of our confidence. Bob Brackett : Okay. So, not much to worry about from that perspective. Thank you for that. Operator : And our next question will come from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeanine Wai : This is Jeanine. My first question is on inventory quality, back to that Slide 13, where you show rate of return versus your premium well count at different oil prices. For that curve, what does the distribution look like by basin and can you point to kind of where 2020 - where that sits on the curve? Bill Thomas : On the curve, the distribution of the wells, the returns is about the same at each one of our plays. It looks very much the same. We have single premium, double premium, triple premium wells in really every play that we're developing. And then our 2020 plan, the returns on our 2020 plan would reflect about the median there. When we look back on our scorecard for last year, our 2019 plan, our returns at the current prices are at $40 flat oil. We're about the median. So, that represents the median returns there which are 53% at $40 - I mean, 58% at $40 flat and an incredible 83% after tax rate of return at $50 flat oil prices are about the returns that we're getting on our drilling program. Jeanine Wai : That's really helpful. My second question is on the balance sheet and maybe we're just being a little too nuanced here but we noticed that there was a slight change in messaging on the debt reduction program from I think the slide went from targeting $3 billion in debt reduction to quote evaluating options for current maturity. So, can you just provide a little color on this whether you have any new debt or cash target in response to the macro view and I guess the reason why we're asking is because we had thought that getting through your $3 billion debt reduction program was potentially a trigger for doing share buybacks or other things of the free cash flow. Bill Thomas : Yes, Tim will comment on that. Tim Driggers : Yes. So, there was a slight change there and the reason was where we're at in the commodity cycle. We will pay off our two bonds that come due this year. One is due April 1 and the other's June 1. They are $500 million each. So, obviously we'll pay those off. We'll then evaluate where the market is currently and where it looks like it will be going long term to see where commodity prices are going and make a decision, a prudent decision whether or not to refinance those bonds or not. The goal is still to pay off $3 billion over that period of time, but we have to be prudent and look at the conditions at the time and decide where to go. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Thomas for any closing remarks. Bill Thomas : Well, first of all 2019 was the best operating performance in the history of the Company and that is just due to - just what we've been talking about is to everybody in EOG. So, thank you to everybody in EOG for doing a fantastic job. We're excited about carrying that momentum into 2020. The Company's got a great balance sheet. We've got operational flexibilities we've talked about, industry-leading premium inventory and a unique EOG culture. So, the Company is set to weather the storms and weather the downturns and to continue to deliver strong results in the future. We're really excited about where we are and where we're headed. So thanks for listening, and thanks for your support. Operator : And thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Please note this event is being recorded.  At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir. Timothy Driggers : Thanks, and good morning. Thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing first quarter 2020 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions as well as reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and in the accompanying investor presentation slides may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential, not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our earnings release issued yesterday. Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Ezra Yacob, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor and Public Relations.  Here's Bill Thomas. William Thomas : Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I first want to acknowledge those responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, the health care workers, first responders and other dedicated professionals addressing this crisis on the frontlines. Some of you are part of the EOG family, and we thank you for your dedicated and courageous service. EOG is a resilient company. And we believe the severity of this process will demonstrate just how resilient we are. The COVID-19 pandemic compounded what started as an oil price war, which drove oil prices to levels we have not seen in more than 20 years. While this shock to the market is unprecedented, and it's difficult to predict exactly how long it will take demand to recover and inventories to decline, like every other downturn, EOG will emerge a stronger global competitor, uniquely positioned to capture the upside of the oil market recovery. There are two reasons we're confident in our resiliency. First is the EOG culture and second is our premium drilling strategy. Times like these are when the EOG culture shines and becomes even more valuable because downturns supercharge our ability to improve. Our culture has responded quickly by aggressively reducing capital spending to a level that will allow EOG to generate free cash flow this year, assuming current commodity strip prices. We continue to be innovative and entrepreneurial by identifying creative ways to rapidly reduce operating expenses and develop new technical improvements that we can sustain into the oil price recovery. EOG is decentralized, driven by interdisciplinary teams that are empowered to make real-time data decisions based on basin-specific market conditions. Most importantly, we are rate of return-driven, and we will not invest the dollar unless it earns a good return, even in this price environment. The EOG culture is rising to the challenge and making a difference at every level and in every area of the company. Our super-talented EOG employees, armed with our advanced information technology analytics, are at the heart of this culture, and I am incredibly grateful for the way they have responded to this unique downturn. I can't thank our employees enough. The second reason we're confident that EOG will weather the severe downturn is our premium drilling strategy. We believe it's the most strict investment hurdle rate in the industry. Premium requires that all investments earn a 30% direct after-tax rate of return using an oil price of $40 flat. We initiated our premium strategy in 2016 during the last downturn. Since then, we have continued to improve the quality of our drilling inventory with substantial and sustainable well cost reductions. The improvement in our returns and cost structure has made EOG more resilient to low oil prices and positioned us to respond quickly to this unprecedented downturn and manage our business efficiently should the downturn be prolonged. As a result, we have a significant amount of premium inventory, more than 4,500 identified locations, in fact, that earn at least a 30% direct after-tax rate of return with $30 oil, which is even lower than the $40 used to meet the premium hurdle. Armed with this high-return inventory, EOG is well positioned to continue to be a leader in returns. We entered this downturn in a position of operational and financial strength, and the reason for this is our consistent approach to the fundamentals of our business : return-focused capital allocation, supported by a strong balance sheet.  Rest assured that EOG's priorities will remain the same throughout the duration of this crisis. First, only invest capital if it generates premium rates of return. Our disciplined approach to reinvestment does not change. We invest to make a return, even with low oil prices. We will not drill a well if it doesn't earn at least a 30% direct after-tax rate of return. Second, utilize our operational flexibility to cut expenditures quickly. We exercised the operational flexibility allowed by our contracts with service providers to revise our development plan to be consistent with our outlook for oil prices over the next three quarters. Third, accelerate technical innovation across the company. Lower activity does not hamper our innovation. In fact, true to the EOG culture, each of our divisions have already started to implement multiple initiatives to further reduce our cost structure, improve well productivity and advance our exploration program. Fourth, exit 2020 with momentum by increasing production and to the price recovery. While we remain flexible and responsive to the pace of the price recovery, we have a large inventory of newly completed wells waiting to be put online. We plan to bring those to sales as prices begin to recover during the second half of 2020 and exit the year with momentum heading into 2021. Fifth, protect the financial strength of the company. Our goal each year is to spend within cash flow and maintain an impeccable balance sheet to support operations and protect our dividend through challenging times.  Sixth, continue to strategically invest in the long-term value of our business. Through each of the prior downturns, EOG has emerged a stronger business because we continue to invest in the long-term value of the company. Whether it was leasing exploration acreage in the Eagle Ford to jump-start our transition to oil or the Yates acquisition in 2016. Challenging times for the industry often offer the best opportunities to invest. And finally and most importantly, maintain our unique culture. Our culture is the key to our success, and we put a priority on protecting our unique ability to sustainably reduce costs, improve our inventory and strategically adjust to market conditions. Our ultimate goal has not changed : to be one of the best companies in the S&P 500. We believe the company will make tremendous progress towards this goal in 2020. By making EOG more cost efficient, by fostering innovation, by sharpening our technical edge and progressing new exploration potential, we will emerge a stronger global competitor, uniquely positioned to capture the upside when all markets recover and continue creating long-term value for our shareholders. Next up is Tim to review our current financial position. Timothy Driggers : Thanks, Bill. A conservative approach to our capital structure has been a cornerstone of EOG's financial strategy throughout our history. This is borne out of a recognition that oil and gas business has always been capital-intensive and cyclical. These cycles are as inevitable as they are unpredictable, and so a business must be built not just to withstand them, but to have the financial strength at the right times to be able to take advantage of them. EOG entered the downturn in very good shape. Cash at the end of the first quarter was $2.9 billion, which included roughly $760 million of collateral from hedge contracts. This compares to total debt of $5.2 billion for a net debt to total capital ratio of less than 10%. This is down from 13% at the end of last year and a recent peak of 34% in 2016. We reduced net debt by $4 billion in the last 4 years. Our liquidity position is further supported by a $2 billion unsecured revolving line of credit, which has no borrowings against it. Our long-term debt ratings, which were recently reaffirmed by S&P and Moody's, stand 4 notches into investment grade. Furthermore, on April 14, EOG issued 10- and 30-year bonds totaling $1.5 billion, enhancing our already strong liquidity position. Last month, we also repaid a maturing $500 million bond, and we plan to repay with cash on hand, the $500 million bond maturing on June 1. Given the outlook for oil prices for the remainder of the year, EOG has also added additional hedges for 2020. We now have hedged more than 95% of our second quarter oil production at an average price of $48 and more than 50% of our third quarter production at $47. This mirrors how we view the periods of greatest price risk and adds another dimension to our approach to maintaining a resilient business by securing that portion of our cash flow. We will begin to look at adding additional '21 hedges later in the year if prices look attractive relative to our assessment of the market fundamentals. Maintaining and growing the dividend remains a top priority as it is the most tangible output of EOG's high-return premium business model. We have never cut the dividend, never issued equity to support the dividend and have not relied on asset sales at fire-sale prices to make it through a downturn. The Board yesterday declared a quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share or $1.50 per share annualized rate, which maintains the rate from the 30% increase declared last quarter. The dividend is designed to be sustainable through low price cycles without straining the balance sheet or sacrificing other priorities. We test these priorities against numerous down cycle scenarios so we can be confident these goals are achievable even under extremely stressed conditions. This resilience reflects EOG's strong returns, low-cost structure and financial flexibility. EOG's financial strength also gives our operations teams to be able to take necessary actions with a focus on long-term benefits to the company instead of making forced short-term decisions. Next up is Billy to review our operational performance. Lloyd Helms : Thanks, Tim. I want to highlight the major steps taken to adjust our operating plan by providing some detail. First, on our capital and operating cost-reduction efforts. And second, the steps taken to reduce production during the low points in the oil price curve. Our swift response to the current environment is evident in our first quarter performance. We reduced capital by $265 million or 14%, while essentially hitting the midpoint of the guidance for oil volumes. For the entire year, we reduced our capital plan to $3.5 billion, more than 45% lower than the original plan. Demonstrating the flexibility in our operational plan, we reduced our drilling rig fleet 78% from a peak of 36 rigs down to 8 in the span of just 6 weeks. On the completion side, we reduced activity 69% from 16 frac fleets to just five. Our flexible contracting strategy, combined with our established reputation as a consistent operator that values strategic vendor relationships, have allowed us to make these adjustments without incurring significant costs. The goal is to generate high rates of return for the capital we choose to invest along with free cash flow while maintaining our leverage to the up cycle as demand recovers. Our ability to reposition the company to achieve that goal in a few short weeks is a testament to EOG's strong culture and decentralized organization, and most of all, our fast-acting innovative employees. I'm incredibly proud of them. We also reduced exploration and infrastructure capital without sacrificing projects with the highest long-term benefit to the company. Exploration capital has been focused on the prospects with the most promise to add future shareholder value. On the infrastructure side, the concentration of our activity in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford, where we have existing well-developed assets in place, naturally reduces infrastructure needs. And we are also maintaining our commitment to reducing our environmental footprint by retaining investment in high-impact projects. On the operating cost side, we reduced lease operating expense by more than $300 million or approximately 20% compared to the original plan. Our operations teams are highly engaged in cost reduction, and we are realizing savings from many areas, including fewer expense workovers, reduced maintenance and repairs, water disposal and compression expense and contract labor. While reducing activity has driven significant initial cost reductions, we are maintaining a level of activity that allows us to accelerate technical innovation. The biggest opportunity from the downturn will be to identify a step-change efficiencies and operational improvements that lead to sustainable cost reductions. For example, our drilling and completion teams continue to establish new performance records in each area as illustrated on Slides 39 and 43 of our investor presentation. Across all our operations, we believe we will be able to lower well cost another 8% this year, most of which will be sustainable as a result of the improved efficiencies. This is a testament to the continued drive and innovation to raise the performance bar in the spirit of continuous improvement that allows us to consistently reduce well cost in each of our plays. The cadence of our new capital plan is heavily front-end-loaded. Most of the $1.7 billion of first quarter capital was spent before the downturn began. As a result of rapidly reducing activity, we expect to spend about $650 million in the second quarter and decline sequentially in the third and fourth to total just $3.5 billion for the year, nearly half of our original plan. Our 2020 production profile reflects a rate of return decision. Even though 90% of our shut-in production is cash flow positive at $10 per barrel and we have access to multiple markets, rather than produce at potentially the lowest price point of the year, we elected to shut in existing and deferred additional production by delaying the start-up of new wells. We plan to continue to defer production through the first half of the year. This deferred inventory of new wells has been completed and is simply waiting to produce. This allows us to exert more control over the cash margins of every barrel we produce and provides us the ability to quickly increase oil volumes into an improving oil price environment. We began deferring production during the first quarter. And even after delaying initial production from new wells and shutting in 8,000 barrels a day in March from existing wells, we achieved the midpoint of our guidance. First quarter and second quarter represent the peak and the trough, respectively, of our U-shaped production profile in 2020. Between deferred start-ups and new wells drilled and completed, we anticipate turning online approximately 300 additional wells in the second half of the year, for a total of 485 by the end of 2020. Volumes are currently forecasted to increase in the second half of 2020, with fourth quarter production averaging about 420,000 barrels of oil per day, establishing momentum going into next year. The capital required to maintain this level of production going forward would be approximately $3.4 billion per year. Our production profile corresponds to the current outlook for oil prices. However, we will remain flexible to make further adjustments if the operating plan as conditioned -- to the operating plan as conditions change. If prices stay lower for longer, we can make additional reductions to our capital and operating costs and further defer bringing new wells online. To be clear, we would rather shut in production than sell in to an uncertain low-price market. Ultimately, the decision to begin increasing production will be based on a more sustainable and constructive outlook for oil prices in the second half of the year. For the oil that we do choose to sell, we have secured favorable prices through various contracts providing exposure to Brent, Gulf Coast, WTI and fixed prices. The marketing strategy provides flexibility to pivot each of our producing areas to multiple markets to capture the highest margin. In conclusion, I am proud of how decisively and thoughtfully our employees responded to this downturn. We exercised our flexibility to quickly cut capital and operating costs. And the decision to reduce volumes at the lowest point of the price curve supports our intent to accomplish 2 primary objectives : one, enhance the margins from each barrel that is produced; and two, maximize our rate of return for any investment. While EOG is not immune from the effects of low oil prices, we have the tools and the information to make real-time adjustments to maximize our profitability. We will remain disciplined, invest wisely and constantly evaluate market conditions to generate the most shareholder value. Now here is Bill to wrap up. William Thomas : Thanks, Billy. EOG is a resilient company. And while we aren't completely immune to the level of demand disruption caused by the pandemic [Technical Difficulty]. Operator : Pardon me, this is the operator. It appears the main speaker line does not produce an audio. Please stand by for one moment [Technical Difficulty]. William Thomas : Yes, this is Bill. Operator : Thank you, Bill. We missed the last part of your presentation, sir. William Thomas : All right. In conclusion, EOG is a resilient company. And while we aren't completely immune to the level of demand destruction caused by the pandemic, we are prepared for it. Our financial structure is very conservative, and our capital-allocation process is hyper-disciplined.  This is an unprecedented downturn. U.S. oil production is in severe decline, and it could take years for domestic production to turn around. We believe that the historic and prolific oil production growth by U.S. shale may have been forever altered. And while the timing and level remains uncertain, we are confident demand will improve. Therefore, current prices are not sustainable. In the inevitable price recovery ahead, there is tremendous opportunity for EOG. With a strong balance sheet in hand, a culture that drives continuous improvement and our commitment to generate strong returns with free cash flow, EOG will be ready to provide much-needed supply when prices show sustainable improvement. We don't believe there's a better company positioned to capture the upside as the oil market recovers. EOG will not only survive this downturn, but emerge as a stronger competitor in the global market. Thank you for joining us this morning. Our thoughts are with you as we navigate this pandemic together. We sincerely hope your family, friends and colleagues are healthy and safe. Operator, that concludes our remarks, so please open up the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And today's first comes from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Leo Mariani : Just wanted to ask in terms of the budget this year. Obviously, you cut it a couple of times here, clearly prudent response to oil prices. I, too, agree that oil prices are unsustainable at these levels on a global basis. If we were to see just a rapid increase, say, in oil prices as we got later in the third quarter and fourth quarter, would you guys consider adding more capital back late this year to get you guys a little bit more ready for growth mode in '21? William Thomas : Yes. Leo, this is Bill. And I think we're going to be very cautious before we add capital this year. And it's unlikely that we would add any more additional capital until -- we want to get into 2021 and see how demand continues to recover. And so we wouldn't -- I don't think we're going to be adding any capital in the remaining of the year. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. And Bill, you certainly talked about emerging stronger from this pandemic. You kind of referenced potential M&A is an option. What do you think sort of other than kind of continuing to lower the cost structure of what you guys are doing, what are the other keys to kind of emerging stronger? And you think maybe there could be some likely M&A late this year, if there are opportunities? William Thomas : Yes. I want to be -- I think we've been pretty clear over the years about M&A. We're not really interested at all in any, certainly, low-return M&A or acquisitions. It's really difficult. It has been historically as everybody knows M&A market. It's very difficult to make a good acquisition and generate a strong return at the same time. And everything we do, as you know, EOG, we're totally focused on returns. And so every dollar we spend, every deal we do has to be competitive on a return basis. And it's very difficult to compete with organic exploration effort. We're adding a lot of very low-cost acreage that we believe contains drilling inventory that will be better accretive to the quality that we have now. So it's very unlikely we'll do certainly a large M&A. We do small bolt-on acquisitions to supplement our exploration efforts just to get low-cost acreage. But large M&As are really not, in our view, competitive. Other than the cost reductions that we're making, obviously, we've spelled out a lot of those here, Billy has, we continue to be very innovative all over the company. We continue to see excellent technical work and a focus on innovation and new ideas. And those are just coming out in multiple areas of the company, completion technology, a lot of great geotechnical work going on in the company. And we haven't taken our eye off of our exploration effort, and I'm going to ask Ezra Yacob to maybe comment on that a little bit. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Bill. As everyone knows, we entered the year with a pretty exciting exploration program. We're focused on capturing positions in basins where we capture the Tier 1 position, and we're working plays that we think will be improving the inventory quality with low decline and certainly low-cost plays. And we're -- we entered this year with a plan of testing and leasing in 10 different prospects. And we've obviously reduced our exploration budget this year, commensurate with reductions across other categories. But we're still planning to progress each of those prospects a little bit this year. We'll remain flexible as we do. But really, the purpose, as Bill said, is that these all have the potential to add significant long-term value creation for the business and for our shareholders. And as Bill pointed out, we've all seen here, over the past, say, 6 or 8 weeks since our employees have been working from home, is really just an amazing effort from all of them on the development side and the exploration side to come up with and generate new ideas. And we just couldn't be more impressed or commend the employees for their efforts on that. Operator : Our next question today comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer : We appreciate the specificity on guidance for production for the remainder of the year and the quantification of the expected shut-in. When we look at the production, excluding the shut-ins, second quarter's oil production is implied down about 19% from the first quarter. Can you just talk to the drivers of that and whether to use that 19% as indicative of an annualized natural decline, whether there are other factors that are influencing that? William Thomas : Brian, I'm going to ask Billy to comment on that. Lloyd Helms : Yes. Good morning, Brian. The way I would look at that, we're still -- I would still like to emphasize that our annual decline rate that we've provided in previous guidance of 32% is still accurate and true. The shape of that on a quarter-to-quarter basis depends a lot on the nature and the timing of when you bring on wells prior to that. So it can be a little bit -- it can fluctuate quite a bit. It can be a little bit lumpy as you might think of it. It's strictly depending on the timing of bringing on wells in a quarter or two prior to that. So naturally, it's a little steeper at the first part of the life of a well and then flattens out later in the life. So that's kind of what you're seeing in the second quarter. I wouldn't take the decline you're calculating there. That 19% is an indication of a change in our quarterly or annual decline that we've given you in the past. Brian Singer : Great. And then my follow-up is both an EOG and then a broader question with regards to maintenance capital and shale supply cost. How much of the $3.4 billion of the maintenance capital do you think includes cost reductions you believe are secular versus cyclical? You talked about, I think, 8% cost reductions coming from here to well cost and wondering whether that was factored into the $3.4 billion. And then I guess that the lower maintenance capital, you and other companies are highlighting reflect another large step down in the supply cost for EOG and shale generally? Or is it just a function of the market and the low oil price environment that we're in? William Thomas : I'm going to ask Billy to talk about the first part of the question. Lloyd Helms : Yes, Brian. So just to be clear, our $3.4 billion maintenance capital we talked about is to maintain the 420,000 barrels a day we plan to exit the fourth quarter at. And to give you a little more color on how we calculate that, that does not anticipate the cost savings that we've talked about here today. We are -- our capital programs are based on the kind of a backward-looking actual well costs that we've been able to attain to date and doesn't bake in costs, anticipated cost savings on a go-forward basis. So in light of that, I think there's -- we always think about that as potential upside to achieve better results. So our capital plan this year and our capital plan or the maintenance cost that we've quoted here, the $3.4 billion, doesn't bake into the 8% cost savings that we're talking about in this call. In addition to that, I think it's important to know that the $3.4 billion, just to go back to that, it's maintained the 420,000 barrels a day that we're exiting the year-end. William Thomas : On the second part of that question, Brian, as we look at the whole industry, there certainly are companies that are doing a good job continuing to lower costs, but we believe there's a really small set of those because it really takes scale. It's probably one of the biggest drivers to be able to continue to lower cost. A lot of the cost reductions are certainly in infrastructure in a very continuous drilling program and completion program, et cetera, et cetera. I think really -- so I think a few companies, as I kind of commented in the opening remarks, we believe there will be less companies after this downturn than there were before. We think they'll be more disciplined. Certainly, there'll be more -- there'll be less capital employed in the shale business. But we believe, as we said, that EOG is going to emerge as a leader. And most of our cost reduction, nearly all of our cost reduction, is driven internally through the technical innovation in the company and the efficiencies. We just -- there's a lot of data in our IRR chart that shows the amount of stages per day. Certainly, the feet per day on drilling, et cetera, et cetera, as well as -- I want to note, maybe there's a slide in the Powder River Basin, on our recent completions in the Mowry, in the Niobrara, where our completion technology is certainly making a huge difference in the well productivity. So most of the improvements in EOG are driven from our internal culture and our innovation and our just desire to always continue to get better. We have a very sustainable model and culture, and we do not see any end in sight in EOG getting better. Operator : Our next question today comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : I appreciate the sentiments you expressed there at the end of your prepared remarks, and I just reflect that back to you and everyone there at EOG. One question, I was a little bit surprised to see that you guys still are forecasting some shut-ins to go into 4Q. And I'm curious if you could kind of characterize what sort of production that is that's still shut in 4Q. I could see an argument for it being the last sort of legacy vertical wells to come back on, but I could also see an argument for it being high-rate wells that you want to deliver to the strongest market. So I wonder if you could add some color there. William Thomas : Charles, I'll ask Billy to comment on that. Lloyd Helms : Yes. Charles, so that's a good question. I'm glad you asked it. It's -- the 20,000 barrels a day that we referenced that would likely still be shut in, in the fourth quarter, is simply wells that have some form of expense that's required to bring them back on production. For instance, you have a lot of reasons why production goes down. These are wells that might have to replace gas lift valve in downhole or maybe a hole in the tubing or things that require some expense work-over to bring back to production. And we just haven't made the decision yet to expend the capital or the expense dollars to bring those wells back to production until we see the margins improve to a point where we would do that. So for the sake of the plan, we just assume those wouldn't be brought back on until next year. Charles Meade : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe perhaps related to that, it's interesting to me that, Bill, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you guys have gone ahead and completed wells but are waiting to turn them to sales. And that's a little different from what we're -- what I've heard from a number of other companies that are maybe just electing to build DUCs and not complete. And I'm wondering if that's just a function of you guys wanting to honor your commitments to frac crews or if that's actually expression of some other view about the best way to leave your well or the response time that you want to have when you do see a price signal? Lloyd Helms : Yes, Charles, this is Billy, again. So the way I would think about that is 2 things. I guess, we started -- as the downturn started to happen, we were in the process, of course, of completing several wells. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we dropped our frac fleet count quite considerably there at the start of the year. But we still had wells that were in the process of being completed or just being completed. We elected to not bring those on production at a time when prices were falling so steeply. And likewise, as we continue to cut our frac count down, I think we're running about 5 today, then, those wells, as they're finishing up to completions, we're not bringing those wells on either. So it's just built up, I'd say, an inventory of wells that are in that category that we're waiting on the right timing as to when we view the market fundamentals improving and being constructive going forward to bring those wells on production. Operator : Our next question today comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Two questions. One is either for Bill or Billy. I think one of the silver lining of the COVID-19 is that it triggered a lot of creativity, and you guys certainly have done a lot of that, as you mentioned. So what have we learned from this whole episode? And what is the -- some of the best practice that may impact your future how you run your operation? William Thomas : Yes, Paul. This is Bill. Every situation -- I've been with the company over 40 years, and I've been through a number of these downturns. This is certainly the most unique one that we've ever experienced. What it is really -- what we've really seen inside the company is the tremendous value that our information systems and technology has allowed EOG to make a very granular evaluation of everything we do. Every well in the company, we know about it. We have all the data. And through our decentralized organization, we've been able to analyze down to a very granular level everything we're doing. And so we've learned how important it is to have a great information systems and technology and how effective our employees have been to perform -- and most of them are working from their homes, like everybody else in the world. So that's been a great experience for us on a learning curve. And we see areas in that we can continue to improve and get better in. I think on the technical side of it, we just do not see any end in the advancements coming from the company because, as you all know, EOG, all the ideas all the creativity, all the improvements in the company are from every -- really, every person in the company. It's not from the top down, it's really from the bottom up. And everybody is engaged. And the communications have been really good. We're using Microsoft Teams to have big meetings, divisional meetings and department meetings and meetings between different groups in the company, and that's working out really well. And so it's been a learning experience, but I think we're fortunate to have a lot of that in place, but it's -- we can see some areas in that process that we can continue to improve in. Paul Cheng : Bill, you said a couple of examples, you can say that in the post-COVID world -- I mean, at some point that we will come out from that, that you think it will fundamentally change because of the experience that you learned will be fundamentally changing how you manage your business? Any process or any example that you can cite? William Thomas : I think the fundamentals of the company, return-driven, certainly committed to generating strong free cash flow, maintaining the balance sheet, a strong balance sheet, spending within our means and then focus on returns--we are so focused on returns--those things are not going to change. Those are the fundamentals that drive our business. I think the changes that you see in EOG are just the organic changes that are happening every day as we continue to just gather data and analyze it and apply it.  And I think those are the things that make EOG who we are. So I don't see those things changing. We're focused on totally getting better literally every day. And we believe the opportunity in front of us, because we believe this unique downturn has been so severe, we believe our opportunities will be greater in the future than they've been in the past. Paul Cheng : A final question for me, a short one. On the curtailment, can you tell us that maybe how is the regional or basin split? And also that whether all the curtailment is essentially shut-in or you're moving some of the well production? William Thomas : Paul, I'll ask Billy to comment on that. Lloyd Helms : Yes, Paul. So the way we go about analyzing our business to shut-in wells is at a very granular level. All of our areas are operating in the same manner. We have the tools, as Bill described, the information technology to gather the information, analyze it and push that decision down to the lowest level in our organization to understand the profit margins on every well throughout the company. So with that information, we can make decisions on when and where best to shut-in wells to maximize our cash flow at any given time. So the shut-ins occur on economics based on that way. We also analyze things from a market perspective in the same manner. We have the same information to understand the markets we can take the products to, how to maximize our netbacks for every product on a well level. And so we can do the same kind of analysis from a marketing perspective. And simply part of that decision is making a larger rate-of-return decision that helps us think about, is it better to produce most of that volume into a more volatile and lower-priced environment or based on a macro outlook for the product? Is it best to wait a month or two or potentially longer to bring that production back on? And so I'd say most of the production falls into that realm. And it's made pretty much on every basin across the company in every area. So that's how we analyze it. It's a very granular look across the company. It takes a lot of effort. All of our -- it goes back to the culture of the company, though. And we have so many engaged employees that are really committed to the company and making sure we all do the best thing we can to continue to make the company better. So we couldn't be more proud of the people that we have to make it all work. Operator : And our next question today comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Neal Dingmann : My first question is just around your return requirements. I'm wondering, you all took certainly some major steps this quarter in curtailing existing production suspending D&C. I'm just wondering, are your margin -- Bill, are your margin requirements different when you look at bringing those curtailments back versus thinking about ramping up the D&C activity? William Thomas : When we look at when we're going to bring wells to shut-in or new wells on, we're really just looking at the strip. And we obviously stay very engaged really daily, weekly basis on the world events and the macro view of oil. And so when that becomes more positive and we get more firm that that's sustainable recovery, that's when we'll begin opening things up. We don't have an exact number on the margin. We're just looking for the trends. And then certainly, we're not, as Billy has talked about what we've done, we're not interested in selling our oil at the lowest part of the market. When there's a steep contango in the prices, there's no use selling it now when we can get double in a few months. So that's really -- that's all we're doing on that in that area. Neal Dingmann : Very good. And then just one last question. You definitely hit this quite a bit, but just on activity. I was looking back in '16, it looked like, I think you all had gotten down to, I think, 9 or 10 rigs during that time when we were around $26. And I'm just wondering, does some of that decision on sort of D&C activity and all and just pure, I guess, activity and all, come to how many of these premium locations you have? Or is it simply, Bill, what you had just mentioned, just not wanting to produce into sort of this environment? I guess I was just sort of comparing today versus 2016 maybe and maybe you could just tell us a little color on how you're looking differently at these two periods at this point? William Thomas : Well, certainly, we're not limited by inventory. That -- we have a tremendous inventory. Like we said, we've got 4,500 locations already identified that will do a 30% rate of return at $30, and I'm sure that will grow over time. So that's not the issue at all. Really, our investment pace every year is set on a very conservative price deck in our view of the macro. And the limitations on that are we want to generate free cash flow. We want to spend within our means and generate free cash flow and maintain an impeccable balance sheet, and also, obviously, generate very, very high rates of return. So those are the things that guide us. And so in this particular instance, we're just looking for a bit of better view of the future and what the recovery is going to look like, not only in the price but what's U.S. shale going to look like and then where is our spot in there. We think we'll continue to be the leader in returns and continue to be the company that continue to add very, very significant value. Operator : Our next question today comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : My first question is probably a follow-up to Charles' and Neal's question. It seems to us that EOG is just taking a more aggressive approach on production shut-in than others. And I know it all depends on your macro view and whatever contracts or lease stuff you have or any related shutdown or start-up costs, but do you have an estimate on the NPV uplift for the year for doing the shut-ins and the well deferral versus maybe the business-as-usual case with no shut-ins and no deferrals? William Thomas : Jeanine, I don't -- no, we don't have a number. We can certainly calculate that, but it's more just common sense. We just don't like giving our oil away. We want to make money. We're focused on returns, and we believe just waiting a few months or a quarter that we could get twice as much for oil than we are today. And so it's really just a common sense approach and a return focus and our view on a market that's improving. Jeanine Wai : Okay. And then my second question is, I know we're in the middle of an oil rally here, but we're still only at, call it, $25 WTI. If we see a pullback in oil prices, to what extent are you willing to lean on the balance sheet to support long-term value? I know you're not trying to maximize dollars today or tomorrow, but in terms of the long term, if we see the pullback, is there a point where it becomes just too detrimental to long-term value to keep cutting CapEx? And if so, kind of, what is that level? William Thomas : Yes, Jeanine, we certainly have a lot of flexibility to continue to cut capital. I'm going to ask Billy to comment a bit on that. Lloyd Helms : Yes, Jeanine. So we cut back to the level we did to basically be able to do the things Bill talked about, make sure we generate a rate of return and generate free cash flow and while we see the commodity price outlook today. If that changes and we feel like that we need to cut more, certainly, we have that flexibility to do so and would continue to push that lever down throughout the end of the year, depending on the outlook. So we could still try to manage within cash flow, even with prices stay lower for longer. Operator : And our next question today comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram : Bill, we've seen a lot of different approaches to shut-ins with EOG, Conoco, Exxon and Chevron announcing significant shut-ins. I was wondering how clear is this the decision to shut-in versus not? And I'd also just want to see if you could address one of the questions that came in last night, was just the execution risk in shutting down hundreds, maybe thousands of wells and then restarting those consistent with what you've guided to in the deck. William Thomas : Yes, Arun. I'm going to ask Billy to comment on the execution part. Lloyd Helms : Yes. Arun, thanks for the question. Yes, I think, as we talked before, one of the unique things that we built the company around is our ability to gather data and analyze it very quickly and have that information basically in the hands of every employee in the company, including at the field level. So the actual execution of being able to shut-in and bring back the wells on is fairly painless. It's very simple exercise by communicating that data down to the people out there in the field to be able to make those actions happen. So that effort is very easy to do. As far as any risk of shut-ins, there's really not any risk in our part. I think the cost of shutting in the wells is very minimal, if not 0. The cost of bringing the wells back on is kind of the same thing. And we could actually have all the wells back on production in just a matter of days because, you have to remember, we are a decentralized organization. We have these assets across the country, we have people managing those assets that are very capable and committed to making sure that we do the best things we can, as quick as we can, safely. So the effort is very easy to attain with the culture of the company that we have and the operations we have set up. William Thomas : And I would just -- this is Bill. Just one more comment on that. I think we have multiple years and years of experience of shutting in wells for different lengths of time. And we've got a chart in the IR deck that shows, on these shale wells, there's absolutely no damage when you shut them in and bring them back on for -- whether it's two weeks or two months, we feel very confident about that. So we just view shutting-in as just well-cost storage. That's the lowest-cost storage that we can come up with. And it's a great way to manage your business, especially in a price environment like we're in. Arun Jayaram : Yes, that's a clever way to think about it. Just a quick follow-up. You guys cited the $3.4 billion sustaining capital for the 4Q exit rate at $4.20. How fully loaded, Billy, is that $3.4 billion? I know you talked a little bit about the ability to even maybe push that down based on incremental cost savings, but how fully loaded is that CapEx number? Lloyd Helms : It's in keeping with how we would run our business. So it's -- the way I would think about it is maybe a little more high-graded than it was in the $4.1 billion capital plan that we announced some time ago that people might remember. In that previous maintenance capital plan, it was pretty much designed to keep each division kind of operating flat. This one is truly -- we're going to go to the wells that have the highest return at today's prices. And so it is a little bit more high graded you might think of. It's still spread across multiple basins, though. So I wouldn't jump to the conclusion as just one area. It's still spread across multiple areas. And it includes the infrastructure and facility costs and ESG spending and those kind of things that we typically would include in a normal budget, just maybe at a little bit lesser scale. Operator : And our next question today comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Douglas Leggate : I hope everyone is doing well out there. Bill, you made a number of comments, if I could read them back to you. U.S. shale is forever altered. This is a unique downturn, and there's been a price war. So my question is, can you share with us what that means for your go-forward strategy? And you kind of know what I'm getting at here as the U.S. is doing 50% and Saudi removed the lowest-cost barrels off the market. So it sounds like there's a little bit of a pivot here, and I'm just wondering if you -- if I'm reading that right, if you can walk us through how you see the right mix of reinvestment, growth, cash flow. And I've got a follow-up, please. William Thomas : Yes, Doug. I think, looking into the future, as we said, we believe there's going to be a structural change in U.S. shale. There's going to be less players. I think, certainly, the industry is becoming more disciplined, and it will be even hyper-disciplined coming out of this downturn. So we believe there's going to be significant less capital invested in growth in the U.S.. And so -- and certainly, there will be substantially less growth. We have a hard time seeing that the U.S. production will be able to, certainly, in the next several years, get back up to the levels we've been just a few months ago. So in that lies a tremendous opportunities for the companies that survive, and it's an enormous opportunity for EOG. If you look back on our last 3 years, we've generated an industry-leading return on capital employed of 14%. We generated $5.6 billion of free cash flow, and we returned $3.3 billion back in shareholder-friendly ways with substantial dividend growth and debt reduction. And over that last 3-year period, we've increased our proven reserves by 55%. And we've accomplished this all with an average WTI oil price, WTI oil price of $58. So fundamentally, we're not going to change. We're -- as we've been talking about, we're return-driven and believe in a strong balance sheet. And we believe we're improving at a rate much faster than we have in the past and that we're going to emerge a much better company in the next recovery. So we're going to continue to stick with our fundamentals, evaluate the market conditions and continue to create value. Douglas Leggate : I appreciate the answer. My follow-up is going to be a related question because I'd just like to press you a little bit on this. Because the $58 oil price, Bill, was subsidized by Saudi. And the U.S. growth rate, in my opinion, is no longer going to be tolerated, and obviously, you've been a larger part of that growth. So everything -- there's no issue around the operational capability of the company. You are clearly the leader, if not one of the leaders, in the industry. The issue is whether the business model continues to reinvest 90% of its cash flow and grow, in the words of the Texas Railroad Commission, at a wasteful level in excess of reasonable demand. So the question is really not about your capability, it's about the behavior coming out the other side of this. Going from 36 rigs to 6, do we see you go back to that level of growth? Or do we see you rightsize the organization to pivot more to [indiscernible] what I'm getting at? Because that $58 you referred to was Saudi taking the lowest-cost barrels off the market. William Thomas : Well, I mean, let me make one correction there right off the bat. We've invested about 80% of our cash flow, which is about a really good level. We've been very committed to generating substantial amount of free cash flow. We paid off all that debt, increased our dividend, end of the year last year with $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet. So we haven't been spending all our cash. We've been very disciplined in generating tremendous value with that. As we go ahead and we look to the future, again, we think it's going to be different. So we'll certainly -- we'll be continuing to evaluate that and continue to stick with our fundamentals and see what's the best way for EOG to continue to generate significant value. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Bill Thomas for any final remarks. William Thomas : Thank you. In closing, I just want to say, we've never been so proud of the employees of EOG. The way you have responded to this historic COVID-19 crisis has been outstanding and heroic. During every downturn in my over 40 years with EOG, the company responds with record-breaking improvements. Sooner or later, this crisis will be over and oil will recover. We believe EOG will emerge with the ability to be a stronger and a higher-return company than ever before. Thanks for listening, and thanks for your support. Operator : Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Ezra Yacob, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor and Public Relations. Here's Bill Thomas. Bill Thomas : Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. EOG's second quarter results demonstrate the company's ability to quickly adapt to an unprecedented drop in commodity prices. We exceeded our own expectations by delivering more oil for less capital and lower operating costs, allowing the company to generate significant free cash flow during the quarter. In May, we published our revised plan which aggressively reduced our full-year capital more than 45% and LOE more than 20%. EOG's employees rose to the challenge, not only achieving the incredible reduction targets we said, but beating them. Compared to our aggressive plan and guidance for the second quarter, we produce 7% more oil spent a whopping 26% less capital. And our cash operating costs, which include LOE, transportation, and gathering and processing, were 10% lower. With a rapid reduction in capital and operating costs, the company generated nearly $200 million of free cash flow, while oil process average less than $28 a barrel. Our second quarter results are a testament to the return-focused culture of EOG employees and our ability to pivot quickly in response to the unprecedented level of market volatility and industry conditions. Last quarter, we laid out seven strategic focus points for the remainder of 2020. Here's a quick progress report. Our first strategic point is only to invest capital if it generates a premium right a return. Premium return is defined as a 30% or higher direct after-tax rate of return using a prospect of $40 flat oil. In this downturn, we have raised a return bar even higher by using $30 oil instead of $40 to calculate our 30% rate of return. Our second focus point this year is to exercise operational flexibility to quickly reduce costs, with capital 26 below target, and cash operating costs 10% below target. Our second quarter results demonstrate our ability to move quickly in a volatile environment. Our third focus point is to accelerate our technical innovation across the company. This is an area where we're most excited about. While we anticipated some additional opportunity for innovation because of the slowdown in our pace of development; our employees' ability to accelerate innovation even while working remotely has exceeded our expectations. We recently completed our yearly technical conferences across each discipline, all via video conferencing. We are amazed at the volume of new innovative ideas presented some creative ways to cut costs and new tools to identify and evaluate prospects. I am confident that the tremendous progress we've made this year will accelerate EOG's lead as the sustainable improvements start paying dividends in the future. By driving down the profitable required generating double digit returns and extending EOG's industry leadership and returning on capital employed. Our fourth focus point is to exit 2020 with momentum in the next year by increasing production into the price recovery. As Billy will cover in a few minutes, we've increased our quarterly and full-year production volume estimates. In addition, with the cost reduction for making this year, we have improved our maintenance capital outlook for 2021. We now expect we will be able to maintain higher volumes for the same capital and cover both capital and the dividend with cash flow and less than $40 oil. Our improvements in volume coupled with reductions in well and operating costs are setting us up for strong performance next year. Our fifth focal point this year is to remain hyper vigilant about maintaining our financial strength. Our goal each year is to spend within cash flow and maintain an impeccable balance sheet to support operations and protect our dividend. This downturn has demonstrated the value of the EOG's historically strong balance sheet more than ever. With this goal in mind, we reduced CapEx more than 45% to $3.5 billion so that full year cash flow funds CapEx in the low 30s. If oil prices average $40 for the year, full year cash flow also funds the dividend and generates free cash flow. Sixth, our focus is to continue to invest in the long-term value of the business. In fact, once again, this break in our pace of development has actually accelerated our progress by creating more time to fine tune our quality exploration work. We continue to drill on prospects that we believe will further improve company performance. You will hear from Ezra in a moment regarding recent exploration progress. The seventh focus on this year is the most important. Protecting and enhancing EOG's culture is the key to our continued success. We have highly skilled employees who are focused on constantly improving every area of the company; we remain committed to our employees as they are the ones who are making EOG, a much better company during this downtime. Armed with extensive data for proprietary apps and information technology, EOG employees are overcoming the challenging conditions by continuing not only to innovate, but to accelerate innovation. We believe we're in the process of making another significant improvement in EOG's performance, similar to the last downturn when we initiated our premium drilling program in 2016. As a reminder, with premium standards in place from 2017 through 2019, EOG delivered an industry leading average return on capital employed of 14%, generated $4.6 billion in free cash flow, increased the dividend by 72% and reduced net debt $2.2 billion, and increased proved reserves by 55%. The EOG culture is rising to the challenge again, with innovation that is significantly improving the company's current and future performance. EOG's long-term game plan has not changed. We remain focused on high return reinvestment disciplined organic growth and generating substantial free cash flow to fund a sustainable growing dividend and maintain a strong balance sheet. EOG will emerge from the downturn a much better company and our commitment to creating long-term value for our shareholders has never been stronger. Before, I turn it over to Tim and Billy; I want to note how excited we are to continue our progress towards reducing GHG emissions. We are near the start-up of our 8 megawatt solar and natural gas hybrid electric power compressor station. In addition, we recently formed a sustainable power group within the company. This group will support our innovative culture to bring return focused, low emissions technology and projects forward quickly. EOG is committed to being an innovative leader in sustainability and the long-term in our energy solution. Next up is Tim. Timothy Driggers : Thanks Bill. EOG proved to be exceptionally resilient during one of the most severe quarters for the industry in our memory. I'd like to review the high-level changes in EOG's cash position during the second quarter. EOG had $2.9 billion of cash at the end of the first quarter. During the second quarter, the company generated discretionary cash flow of $672 million and after deducting CapEx of $478 million, we generated $194 million of free cash flow that nearly covered dividend payments of $217 million. Overtime, EOG's working capital position tends to be fairly balanced between current assets and liabilities. However, the increase in market volatility, our working capital balance can fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter. Changes in working capital in the second quarter represented a net cash outflow of $1 billion, which was more than offset by net cash inflow from working capital in the first quarter of $1.2 billion. We expect changes in working capital will be approximately neutral for the full year 2020 based on the current outlook for commodity prices. Moving on to the financing side of the ledger; EOG issued $1.5 billion of new debt and paid off a total of $1 billion in maturing notes during the quarter. This left the company with $2.4 billion of cash on hand at the end of the second quarter. Considering total debt of $5.7 billion, this yields a net debt the total cap ratio of 14%. In addition to cash on hand, a very strong liquidity position is further supported by a $2 billion unsecured revolving line of credit which has no borrowings against it. Looking ahead, we expect discretionary cash flow to exceed CapEx and dividend payments for the remainder of 2020, and oil prices in the mid-30s. In late April and early May, we elected to close out most of our hedge positions for the remainder of the year, as the volatility and commodity markets had abated, and prices seem to have more upside than downside. We affected this primarily by entering into offsetting contracts for those hedge positions we elected to close. Therefore, the timing of cash received or paid for settlement of these closed out hedges remaining the periods for which they are effective. We expect to receive $360 million in net cash payments in the second half of 2020 from these hedge positions that have been closed. As 2021 comes into focus, we will be the opportunistic about hedge -- adding hedges, if prices look attractive relative to our assessment of market fundamentals. Next up is Billy to review our operational performance. Billy Helms : Thanks, Tim. Last quarter, we made the decision to shut-in existing production and deploy our new wells rather than sell into an uncertain and low-price market. Our intent was that our lowest activity levels, lowest capital expenditures and lowest production volumes wouldn't coincide with the lowest point of the commodity price curve. And doing so, we enhanced the cash flow and margins for each barrel produced and maximize the rate of return for our investments. Our employees' execution of our challenging new plan during the second quarter was stellar. They answered the challenge by beating by wide margin; nearly ever capital expense and production goal we targeted under the new plan. After rapidly reducing our full year capital plan by nearly half, second quarter capital came in an additional 26% below target. We also reduced our cash operating expenses a total of 10% compared to the target. One of the hallmarks of EOG is striving for continuous improvements. But the downturn brought a new intensity to this effort. Our employees delivered even more by continuing to innovate capital and expense reductions that will benefit future operations. For example; we increased our full-year total well cost reduction target to 12% up from 8% just a few months ago. Our operating teams continue to drive efficiency in every aspect of our business. Drilling times are consistently improving, yet completion cost of seeing the most improvement during the quarter, down more than 15%. About half the capital savings can be attributed to cost efficiencies and the other half to service cost reductions. Our drilling rigs and frac fleet are largely under existing term contracts. So, service cost savings have been more from ancillary services. As rig and frac fleet contracts expire, we expect to see further cost reductions; therefore, we believe most of these savings to be sustainable. Our cash operating costs were down more than $50 million, or 10% relative to our second quarter guidance. Our operating teams went into high gear to identify opportunities to reduce expenses during the second quarter with a focus on every category. Some of the largest cost reductions are reduced work over expenses, water disposal and lease maintenance and repairs. These reduced expenses played a major role in helping to generate free cash flow during the second quarter. It is also important to note that we have reduced our full-year cash operating cost guidance by almost $20 million, or 6% on a per unit basis. On the production side; we also beat our forecast. This is mainly due to bringing the shut-in volumes back on sooner than anticipated. One observation from our production data revealed that almost every well exhibited some level of flush production before we returning to its previous decline profile; further evidence that the well sustained no damage from the shedding period. In addition, the decline observed from the base production was less than previously forecasted, also contributing to the production beat. As a result, we have raised our full-year oil production guidance by 16,000 barrels of oil per day or 4%. Our dramatically reduced activity and the temporary shut-in our production, combined with the expense reductions generated positive net cash flow, and deferred a large amount of production into a higher price quarter. Slide 12 of our presentation this quarter illustrates the updated shut-in volumes and the corresponding product price. While we have slowed our overall spending, we have maintained our commitment to reducing GHG emissions by continuing to invest in innovative new technologies and initiatives. Our focus on reducing flaring continues with our gas capture right now exceeding 99.5%. To further minimize flaring, particularly when caused by unpredictable downstream market interruptions; we tested a new EOG innovation we have named Closed-Loop Gas capture. Closed-Loop Gas capture is an automated process developed in-house to reroute natural gas back into existing wells when a downstream interruption occurs. Initial results were successful in indicate that our Closed-Loop Gas capture process has the potential to both reduce flaring and return a majority of the captured gas from the well back to production. In late 2019, we initiated a pilot project in New Mexico to combine solar and natural gas to power electric motor driven compressors. Compressors typically use natural gas to power the engines and our source of GHG emissions from stationary combustion. Since solar power is only available during the day, we designed a hybrid power plant to supplement daytime solar power generation with reliable natural gas generation at night. During the day, the solar panels should produce 8-megawatts of power with no combustion emissions. Compared to the traditional natural gas-powered compression; we believe our hybrid power compression will result in lower operating expenses and a meaningful reduction in emissions. This facility will become operational later this month. Both of these projects demonstrate that we approach GHG like every aspect of our business, focusing on sound economic decisions; and continuously improving our operations. EOG has a long history of adapting to changing industry conditions and using technology to improve the company. As Bill noted earlier, to further enhance our efforts to be a leader in GHG reduction, we recently announced a new strategic initiative to identify and implement returns focused, low emissions power generation within EOG. We are confident that this initiative led by our sustainable power group will be another area in which EOG will lead the way in finding more cost-effective methods to generate power while reducing our impact on the environment and generating a healthy rate of return. And finally, I am extremely proud of how all of our employees have responded to this year's challenges, and doing so while adapting to remote working conditions. Here's Ezra for an update on recent exploration success in Trinidad. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Billy. EOG has had very successful business in Trinidad for 27-years. About 20% of EOG's natural gas production comes from shallow water, offshore fields in the Columbus Basin of Trinidad. Most of the gas is sold as feedstock into a sizable petrochemical industry on the island, primarily producing ammonia and methanol. Trinidad has had a competitive financial profile within EOG due to our competitive advantages in the country as a low-cost operator, and our long track record of exploration success. While our capital investments in Trinidad typically make-up a small percentage of our overall CapEx budget, the returns on that capital are competitive with EOG's domestic portfolio, and consistently generate free cash flow and net income. The latest round of exploration and development in Trinidad kicked-off in the spring of 2018 with the acquisition of a set of modern seismic images; the combination of new seismic and updated geologic models provided a deep inventory of prospects to develop our exploration plan. This plan included farming into new acreage held by another operator, where we could apply our low-cost structure to improve the economics on these high potential exploration blocks. Drilling began in July 2019, and we have recorded 4 initial discoveries with estimated natural gas potential of 1 Tcf gross and 500 BcF net to EOG. The discoveries are located in shallow water off the Southeast Coast of Trinidad. Our 2 open-water exploration will support the installation of new production platforms beginning in 2021. The final two wells and the current drilling campaign are in process and should be completed by your end. Production from this drilling campaign will more than offset natural declines from existing wells and provide a foundation of growth EOG's total production in Trinidad. Lastly, the initial success of this latest Exploration Program sets up the potential for additional delineation, and exploration drilling in Trinidad in future years. I would also like to take a moment to discuss our own ongoing domestic exploration effort. We've made good progress moving multiple prospects forward during 2020 despite a reduction to our initial capital plan. Leasing across multiple basins is going well, and we are capturing contiguous positions and what we feel are the sweet spots of these plays. We have an initiated drilling in some projects and are currently incorporating modern well logs and core data into our geologic models. We look forward to providing updates regarding the testing of these prospects at an appropriate time. Next up is William to provide concluding remarks. Bill Thomas : Thanks Ezra. In conclusion, I would like to note the following important takeaways. First, our second quarter operational results were outstanding. We rapidly reduce capital and operating costs while increasing volumes. This resulted in significant free cash flow. Second, we have improved our full-year 2020 guidance by increasing volumes and further reducing costs. Third, our 2021 maintenance outlook has improved to include more oil with no increase in capital. We can maintain higher volumes and cover both capital and the dividend with cash flow at less than $40 oil. Fourth, as demonstrated by results, the EOG culture continues to rapidly and sustainably improve the company. During this downturn, we believe we're in the process of making another step change to improve further profitability. And finally, EOG's fundamentals have not changed. Our focus on returns, discipline; growth, and generation of significant free cash flow to fund a growing sustainable dividend; and strong balance sheet have not wavered. Our commitment to creating long term shareholder value has never been stronger. Thanks for listening. And now we'll go to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. LeoMariani: Hi, guys. I was hoping to get maybe a little bit more color on some of the cost reductions on the well side, from a capital perspective this year. Just looking through the slides, I mean, it looks like maybe it's a little bit more concentrated in the Permian in terms of your expectations. I know that's, where a lot of your activity is occurring, but are you seeing kind of outsized gains there, maybe relative to the Eagle Ford in terms your expectations throughout the year? BillThomas: Yes, thank you, Leo. We're going to ask Billy to comment on that. BillyHelms: Yes. Good morning, Leo. Yes, you're right at most of our CapEx is generally directed towards the Delaware Basin. So certainly on $1 basis that's where most of the savings are as well. Just to give you a little more color on the capital savings, about a third of the capital savings are from efficiency gains. A third from pricing improvements and a third is really just delaying facilities and infrastructure from the second quarter into the future third and fourth quarter of quarter. So from that we were able to see most of the cost savings probably on the completion side of our business, as I mentioned during the notes on the call, and you have to remember, we're still under some long-term contracts for drilling rigs and frac fleet. So, as that roll-off, we expect to be able to capture some of the market rate saving on those in the future, but we're seeing savings on some other ancillary services that I mentioned. Largely things like maybe chemicals being down 20% to 25%, some of the equipment rentals being down 20% to 30%. And things like that. So, you're seeing some savings on some of the other aspects of the business, not necessarily on the frac fleets and drilling rigs. LeoMariani: Okay, that's helpful color for sure. And I guess I was hoping, if you could talk a little about the potential issue surrounding federal acreage here. Certainly saw from the slide, you guys are kind of saying roughly half your premium inventory is located on federal lands. Obviously, the election is clearly uncertain. But do you guys have any thoughts as to kind of, whether or not there might be any limitations going forward on the event of a Biden victory? BillThomas: Yes, Leo, this is Bill. We've got a lot of experience drilling on federal land for decades, and we've been able to successfully navigate all the changes in the past; we've had many changes over the years. And so I'm confident we're well positioned to continue to adapt and not let those changes significantly affect us. There are two reasons why I'm confident. And then I'll ask Billy to add some additional color. The first is we've got a large amount of premium quality drilling potential on non-federal land; we have a tremendous inventory. That's really not affected by the federal changes; that provides significant operational flexibility. On top of that our exploration program that Ezra mentioned, we believe is going to provide some outstanding opportunities to continue to improve our inventory with better rock. And most of that is located on non-federal lands. And we've got a lot of confidence that we can continue to generate and add non-federal potential. That's even better what we have. And then we've got a very strong growing backlog of approved drilling permits on federal land. And I think Billy's got some numbers on that. And then number two; our governments that have a system of checks and balance that allow the voices of many stakeholders to be heard. And as a part of these checks and balances, any changes would take time and have to consider all those stakeholder interests. And so the success of our responsible development is aligned with many important states and communities where we operate; for example, from federal lands, they're shared, the revenues are shared with the States and in 2019 over $2 billion or revenue was paid out over to 35 states. And so it's not an easy thing to change significantly the Federal drilling potential. So I'm going to ask Billy to add some more color. BillyHelms: Yes, thanks, Bill. As Bill mentioned, we're starting with a lot of flexibility with our decentralized culture, multi basin approach, we have the ability to move activity around quite extensively. On top of that, our exploration program, which is in basin really outside of our current operating areas, has the opportunity to further add to our non-federal drilling inventory. As Bill mentioned, we have quite a few premium locations that we've announced and about half of those are on non-federal lands. In addition, almost half of our premium locations that work at $30 are also non-federal lands and you can look at Slide 10 of our deck that illustrates that. So the part of that was to meet the rate of return hurdle at $30, about half of those are non-federal. So it's pretty good distribution of both federal and non-federal makeup, that entire inventory list. And the non-federal inventory is just as high quality as our federal. So the impact of our non-federal inventory it supports at least eight years of drilling with similar capital efficiency is we're experiencing in our 2020 plan. And Bill mentioned, we have quite a few federal permits, we have about 2,500 federal permits that are approved or in progress, and which is certainly more than four years of inventory. And also in the Permian Basin, over 90% of our federal acreage is held by production. Our government also provides, as Bill mentioned, an important system of checks and balances which provides for due process before any regulatory changes, and these changes have to consider the interests of all stakeholders, ultimately, regulatory and legislative changes that denies access to current property rights could amount to a government taking. So there certainly be some legal consequences of going through the process. And then, just to point out too, we have a very good close alignment with our stakeholders, including the communities we work in. And Mexico is a great example of that. We recently conducted a very successful partnership with a state control to complete our Closed-Loop Gas capture project and I mentioned earlier and on a day-to-day basis, I'm very proud of that close working relationship we have built with regulatory agencies really to have a responsible development, open communication, paying attention to their needs. It also enables us to meet our goals and operate in a timely and efficient manner. And our success in turn has helped support a better quality of life for the people of New Mexico, for example, in 2019; the state received nearly 40% of its overall revenue from the oil and gas industry. And that certainly supports the initiatives to increase funding for public health, education, and infrastructure improvements, and so on. On top of that, oil and gas development supports 100,000 jobs in Mexico along with the associated economic activity and benefits. A significant amount of that revenue from oil and gas activities on federal lands is also dispersed to the state governments to support local communities. And of course, the two states have benefited the most are New Mexico and Wyoming. New Mexico received $1.2 billion and Wyoming $641 million in 2019 alone. And the BLM estimates that oil and gas activity on federal lands provided about $70 billion economic uplift nationally, and supported about 300,000 jobs. So there are a lot of important considerations and stakeholders involved in any of these decisions to consider when changing the rules on federal land. So for these reasons, along with our diversion, and really growing inventory, we remained extremely confident that EOG will be able to continue to navigate through any changing regulatory landscape, just as we have in the past. Operator : And our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. BobBrackett: Good morning. I'm intrigued by the comments that bringing back shut-ins led to flush production and lower than expected decline, is there a learning there to apply to future developments? And is the mechanism understood? BillThomas: Billy, do you want to comment on that? Or Ken? KenBoedeker: Yes. This is Ken, Bob. The majority of our worlds are single zone wells under primary depletion. So as we shut those wells in; they continue to build bottom hole pressure and then we turn them on those wells will show flush production until that bottom well pressure is has gone down to what it was prior to that. So it's a mechanism that's well understood for the horizontal wells that we have that are under that. We don't have any wells that are under water floods or multiple zones where you can have one zone damaging another. So it is well understood and it's following exactly what we expected on the flush production profiles. BobBrackett: And then what about the lower than expected decline? KenBoedeker: On the base decline; in terms of the base decline, we'll see the lower base decline was just that we saw those wells we had forecasted them conservatively, and the wells are performing better than what we thought they would. Operator : Our next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. PaulCheng: Thank you. Good morning. I'm just curious that, I mean, one of the comments is that with the slowdown in the activities, you have seen a substantial improvement in the efficiency because you have more time there to work on. So if we extrapolate that, I mean, even when the commodity prices are returning to higher level, is it better off for the company from a return standpoint for you to slow your activity level and not trying to grow as fast? BillyHelms: Yes, Paul, thank you. The efficiencies we've seen a substantial amount of innovative ideas that have been generated and I think when people have more time to think, instead of doing things they think through and they are able to look at the data and analyze it. They are able to come-up with more ideas and a lot of creative ideas. One of the basis of our disciplined growth strategy is to grow at a pace that we can get better; we don't ever want to grow so fast and have so much activity that we cannot get to we cannot get better at the same time. So it's really is a balance you can only allocate capital in a certain speed; if you go too fast, you outrun your learning curve, et cetera, et cetera. So there is a benefit to a proper pace. And we have been able to benefit from this slowdown, every downtime that we are in. And we have experienced multiple ones over my 40-years. Every downturn, we make the biggest improvements in the company. It's a challenge, the times are challenging. This has been no different than any of the others; other than we're working more remotely than we ever have. And we're very fortunate to have in place our very extensive information technology system and our database, and all of our apps. In that we've leveraged all that technology to analyze and to make changes; and to come up with ideas how to kind of continue to improve the company. So we're super excited about where we're headed. I think we're going to exit this downturn a much, much better company; able to generate even higher returns than we have in the past, and really do all of our business better than we have in the past. So it's a very exciting time for us. PaulCheng: Can I follow-up on that slightly different way? One of your major competitors is also a well-known premium growth E&P company have drastically shifted their business model, and taken a more balanced growth and cash return with a well-defined cash flow reinvestment approach or a distribution approach. And one of the arguments that they also make is that while growing faster may on paper see a higher net percent value but in logic you are at the mercy of OPEC. And I think the behavior of NPS and Putin in the recent times show that may no longer be a reliable to depend on. So I mean do you guys agree with that kind of argument? And if not, why not? I mean we're trying to understand why that a premium operator like EOG will not want perhaps to have a more a balanced growth and cash return business model and trying to grow at a slower pace than what you previously has been, even when the commodity price is getting much higher? BillThomas: Paul. Yes, that's an excellent, observation. And we are fundamentally a return focus company and that's what we've been doing for a number of years. If you look back at the last three years, we gave out these numbers. They're on our slide deck, and I've talked about it in the opening, we've been a leader in the industry return on capital employed, so we're focused on improving returns every year. And we've also been a leader in generating free cash flow; we generated over one and a $1.5 billion of free cash flow over the last three years every year and for $4.6 billion. And that funded a very sustainable growing dividend. We increased the dividend by 72%, and we reduced our debt; our net debt over $2 billion. So we've been a very disciplined company, and we did all that at a spending level that was our cash, our CapEx to cash flow ratio was about 80%. So really what you're hearing from really the rest of the industry is are now moving into the model that EOG has been working really for the last three years. And we're thrilled about that. That is fantastic. For the industry, for investors, and certainly, it's very positive for all processes, we move forward. So, we agree, they're doing the right thing. And that's the thing that we've been doing for a number of years, and we fully support their move. Operator : Our next question will come from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please go ahead. NealDingmann: Good morning, all. And nice to see the continued diversified approach. My first question is around as comments in your release about the improved 2021 maintenance CapEx leading to a higher for 4Q exit rate. Really, I guess the way my comments on this, based on this, could you speak to what this mean for the trajectory for next year as well as what this potentially could mean for even 2022? BillThomas: Billy, do you want to address that? BillyHelms: Yes. Good morning, Neal, this is Billy. So on 2021 maintenance capital; previously, in previous quarter, we outlined the same capital number for about 420,000 barrels a day, which was believed to be at that time what our exit rate would be for the for 2020. Certainly bringing out a bunch of extra production this year, but also incorporating the cost savings we're achieving this year. We believe we can do this same capital dollar number $3.4 million, but maintain the exit rate we're seeing this year of 300 -- or 440,000 barrels a day, which is a significant improvement again in our capital efficiency number. So we believe we can maintain that as we go forward; that is not just meant to be a single snapshot. I think one thing it doesn't make into that and make sure everybody understands this is forecasting on what we're achieving today. It doesn't make in any improvements in, and well performance that we expect to be able to continue to see, as well as cost reductions that if things stay where they are, and we're saying in this environment; we're extremely confident we'll still continue to see cost improvements that will drive our maintenance capital number improvements in the future. So, yes, I'm extremely confident we can have ongoing maintenance capital program and this same kind of area that we're talking about today. NealDingmann: Very good. My second question just around your technical innovations, given the strength and I think you'll have really above anybody else on the upstream side, would this ever lead you to consider broadening the business by considering any sort of clean tech or [Indiscernible] related investment? BillThomas: Neil. Yes, our focus on GHG reductions is in this forming this sustainable power group within our company is to really focus on technology, bringing technology forward more quickly inside the company, and it's really another organic efforts like we do everything else inside the company to really improve our emissions, but also make sure that we can do it at a very high rate of return. And so it's really to facilitate our ongoing culture. We have tons of ideas that are coming from our divisions, and our folks involved in the field operations. And so we -- so we're really excited about the technology, and the innovations that's coming forward. And we're really excited about continuing to reduce our emissions. And certainly any kind of technology in this area, we believe will not only benefit EOG, but it could benefit the industry. And so we're open with that. It's not a proprietary thing. It's something we're doing to really continue to improve our environment. Operator : Our next question will come from Phillips Johnston with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead. PhillipsJohnston: Hey, guys, thank you. Just to follow-up on Paul's question. EOG really stands out because unlike all your peers, you never cut the dividend over the last six years, and you also resisted all the pressure to buy back your stock over the last few years almost of your competitors; destroyed a lot of value doing that. The company that Paul talks about is laid out plans to start paying variable dividends or special dividends on top of the regular base dividend. I realize you guys want to continue to grow the base dividend at a healthy clip, but my question is, is there any appetite at the board level to supplement your regular dividend with recurring variable dividends? And if not, what kind of flaws do you see with that type of payout strategy that would prevent you guys from going down that road? BillThomas: Yes, Phil. Yes, your observation is right. We believe a sustainable growing dividend backed by an impeccable balance sheet is certainly the best way to return cash to shareholders, and we're very committed to that. And we don't want to take anything away from that. Having said that, we're certainly open to consider other additional things options. And so when we certainly welcome any shareholder input on that, and we will remain open and flexible to do what's best for everybody. PhillipsJohnston: Okay, are there any flaws or drawbacks that you kind of see with that type of variable dividend strategy? BillThomas: Well, I think the biggest one is it's kind of unknown and inconsistent. And the feedback we've received from many folks as they were -- they would really focus on a more consistent growing dividend. And certainly as you pointed out, we've never ever cut the dividend. And we want to make sure it's sustainable and certainly backing it up with an impeccable balance sheet. And so the mix we've had over the last several years as we talked about, we believe is a really good mix. And we believe that will create very, very significant shareholder value going forward. Operator : And our next question will come from Douglas Leggate of Bank of America Merrill. Please go ahead. DouglasLeggate: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I hope everyone's doing well out there. Bill, I'm afraid I'm going to be beat up on Paul's question a little bit for change question. And just play a couple of things back to you, if I may. It's not that long ago that EOG talked about 15% to 25% oil growth between $50 and $60 oil and the $58 oil price you refer to was subsidized by Saudi, who ultimately sent a bunch of cargoes to the U.S., presumably to teach the U.S. a lesson. So my question is when you walk through all the things that you're laying out about reinvestment rates and so on, the feedback from your peers is that their shareholders are telling them they don't want as much oil growth. So I guess my question to you is what are your shareholders telling you and asking you to do? And why is it not right to cut oil growth in a market that just doesn't need? BillThomas: Yes, Doug. I think as we stated in the opening remarks; fundamentally, we believe we've got a very, very strong game plan. And we've got a tremendous track record to back that up, being the leader and return on capital employed in the industry, while generating very significant free cash flow; and giving it back in a very strong dividend increase, and strengthen our balance sheet. And we believe that was the right strategy before the downturn. It certainly has put the company in a tremendous position where we are right now. And going forward, we believe that's the right strategy going forward to continue to create significant shareholder value going forward. So we believe our game plan is really solid. Our growth is always been very disciplined. Again, we've only allocated about 80% of our cash to CapEx. And so we've been able to grow the company in a very disciplined pace. And as we go into 2021 and the future, obviously, we need to keep our eye on the macro view of oil. We need to be aware of the market conditions. We're not interested in growing all oil volumes at a strong pace and an oversupplied market. Certainly, that's not the right thing to do. But we want to continue when the time is right, we want to continue to grow the company at a disciplined pace, at the pace to where we can continue to improve our returns, and improve our performance. DouglasLeggate: Bill, but as a footnote to the question, I think, people would really appreciate your leadership as a company here because you are one of the bigger companies and capital discipline needs to be defined, and I would urge you to try and do that. And my follow-up is maybe in an obtuse way of asking the same question. You're running 10 to 11 rigs right now; you've got the potential clearly to run three times that amount. So I guess what I'm really trying to get at is, are you planning to retain the same operational capability? In other words, the rest of you move back to that level? Or is like some of the other companies? Is there an opportunity here to address the cost base of the company by right sizing to perhaps a lower level of activity? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. BillThomas: Yes, Doug, we are really committed to our employees; they are the ones that are making our company better. They're the most valuable asset we have in the company. And so we have a lane, we run lane, we actually peaked on employment about four or five years ago; even though we've gotten a much bigger company, our employee base has really not grown. And so they're very highly productive. They're highly motivated. And they're certainly the part of the company that we want to keep intact and take care of and encourage. So we believe we're at the right size to be effective, to be ready as the downturn is over; so we're focused on continuing to maintain and to actually increase our culture or ability as we go forward, so we're very committed to keeping the company in great shape going forward. Operator : And our next question will come from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead. ScottGruber: Yes. Good morning. Can you hear me? Great. I think your rig count today, I think, is around half a dozen rigs. Correct me if I'm wrong on that number, given the continued efficiency gains that you guys continue to achieve? What is the new level of maintenance rig activity and frac activity? BillThomas: Billy, do you want to answer that one? BillyHelms: Sure. Scott. This is Billy. So yes, you're right. We have actually 7 rigs counting to one in offshore Trinidad. So 6 domestically, 1 offshore. And our maintenance capital plan would require about 20 rigs and 10 frac fleets. And we're generally running as I mentioned 7 rigs and 5 or 6 frac fleet today. So we're well under it, when we pulled back our activity, we dropped to a level well below our maintenance capital level. And that's important to note. So the plan certainly going into the third and fourth quarter is be looking at whether or not we want to add a rig or two going into the next year to get to that maintenance level or not. ScottGruber: Got it. And then you mentioned also that you have -- most of your rigs and frac crews under long-term contracts. I imagine those were the ones you kept just given the cost of ending those contracts. Are these generally multiyear contracts and support of new frac e-fleets or did the majority roll off over the next 12-months? I am trying to ascertain when those savings manifest; I imagine the rigs and frac crews today given the deflation on other services, these regional frac crews maybe pushing towards 40% or 50% of your direct well costs. I just trying to get my head around when you could see those savings roll through? BillyHelms: Yes, sure, Scott. Yes, they are multiyear contracts. And I'd say they're various term-- various terms on the contracts. But in general, they're starting to roll off in the next 12 to 18 months. I think the one thing that's important to note is we build what we think are valuable relationships with our most trusted service providers. And we worked through this in partnership with them to make sure we retained not only the performance and the high performing equipment personnel, but the ability to ramp back up when we need to. So it gives us a lot of flexibility as we work through this. And I think, certainly, we build a lot by building that relationship. It's a very trusted relationship we have; it allows us to make to capture some cost savings just been able to capture rates at below market rates in current times, but also maintain the high performing levels of activity that we need to sustain our business. So we're very proud of our relationships we have with them. But, yes, they typically roll off in the next 12 or 18 months. And we'll kind of reassess where we need to be working with those trusted partners. Operator : Our next question will come from Juan Jarrah with TD Securities. Please go ahead. JuanJarrah: Yes, thanks, guys. And thanks for squeezing me in and congrats on the exploration success in Trinidad. I did want to follow-up a bit on your onshore exploration efforts. I noticed easier said than done, but can you comment on any other exploration efforts you consider pursuing outside of the Lower 48 and with that Canada comes to mind and as you know, one of your peers recently announced adding a position to their Montney in Canada, so just curious on that, and I'll stop there. BillThomas: Ezra? EzraYacob: Yes, thanks. Thanks Juan. This is Ezra. As you know, we've got -- you mentioned our Trinidad exploration effort, and then our domestic exploration effort. And so when we think about anything else outside of the Lower 48; it really comes down to how competitive can it be with our pre-existing domestic portfolio? And that's the main driver on it. When we talk about any of our new exploration ideas, whether it's Trinidad or the new domestic portfolio; we're exploring for prospects and rock quality that will be additive to the front end of our pre-existing inventory. At 10,500 premium locations, I'm not sure if we necessarily just need more to continue to backfill that deep inventory; what we're really trying to do is add to the front end of it. And that's what the exploration efforts focused on. Operator : The next question will come from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. BrianSinger: Thank you. Good morning. You mentioned in the 10-Q, that you expect to replace the $750 million of debt coming due next year with other long-term debt. And I thought that was interesting because you've been talking while I think about paying down debt and having the cash on the balance sheet to do so. And so I wondered, if you could add a bit more color on, a; how you're thinking about the right level of free cash flow to pursue? And then if not allocated to paying down debt, where you see the best areas of allocation between incremental drilling, returning it to shareholders, or keeping a high amount of cash on the balance sheet or deploying it elsewhere like M&A? BillThomas: Tim? TimothyDriggers: Yes. So the reason we chose to keep the debt and long-term debt at June 30 was just the uncertainty of the market going forward between now and February when our next debt is due. Certainly, the goal has not changed. And that goal is to pay down debt. So if market conditions play out as such that we have the cash, sufficient cash then we will pay down that debt. But to be conservative, we left it in long-term, just because of the uncertainty in the market. And I guess, Bill, will address the capital allocation portion of your question. BillThomas: Yes, the right level of free cash flow, Brian, is really a function of -- it's obviously variable every year, number one, based on the oil price. We normally we have -- and we will continue to kind of use a conservative view, our macro conservative view of what oil process will be that year. And then we certainly have a goal every year to generate significant amount of free cash flow; is example the last three years we've generated about $1.5 million a year on average free cash flow. And we want to use that to continue to, as Tim said, consider paying our debt now, our goal is to continue to paying our debt down more, and certainly continue to work on our dividends when the environment is healthy. And then after that we will allocate the capital, continue to allocate it at a very disciplined level just like we have in the past. And discipline means that we're not going to allocate the capital at a speed that's too fast to where we cannot learn and grow and get better. We want to always be increasing our capital efficiency and lower our funding costs. Continuing to lower our operating costs, and those kinds of things. And so you have to go at the proper speed to do that every year, and that's really the governor on allocating the capital. And whatever free cash flow is left over after all those things are done, obviously, it's that will be variable by year-by-year, according to the commodity process. We will continue to be committed to using that capital to continue to create shareholder value, and making sure we get the highest return possible avenues on using that cash. BrianSinger: Right, thank you. And then my follow-up goes back to the exploration program. I think as you mentioned, a couple comments I thought was interesting one was that the exploration you're pursuing is even better than what you have, and then that it's in basins outside the current operating area, and largely not on federal land. And I wondered if you could add a bit more color on what type of impact the onshore exploration you're pursuing could have on your potential production or capital investment. One or two years out how, what the proximity is to being able to really move these plays into development and have a level of materiality on your production. And then whether there are above ground issues that need to be worked out with the areas from midstream or other perspective? EzraYacob: Yes, Brian, this is Ezra. Let me try to unpack that one-by-one here. First, I'd say our -- as we've talked about in the past, our domestic exploration effort; these aren't really in Frontier or Wildcat basins. These are in basins where there is an established legacy, oil and gas production. And so if these prospects work out the way that we think they will, and they're additive to the front-end quality of our inventory, we should be able to move them into active development basis pretty quickly, obviously, pending results. The second part of that going back to just the quality of what we're looking for; this is -- it's a better rock quality as we've talked about before, a lot of what we're looking at is tied to what we think we can develop with our horizontal completions technology. And what I mean by that is just exactly how does the rock -- how's it going to respond. How is it going to actually be stimulated and fracture in combination with our stimulation designs? And so those are the two things that we think are really we're focused on; it is definitely not traditional, unconventional types of rocks that have been focused on in the past. And so as we continue to kind of push these prospects forward and get data on them, we will update you guys with our results on the testing. But we're feeling very confident. Everything that we're seeing today that they are going to continue to be, as I said earlier, additive to the front end of our -- what really is a pretty deep inventory to begin with. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Thomas for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir. Bill Thomas : In closing, first, we want to thank all EOG employees for the outstanding job you're doing to improve the company during this historic and challenging downturn. As we said, the company is improving very rapidly. And we're going to emerge from this downturn a better and stronger company. So we're eager to extend our leadership, and return on capital employed; discipline growth, free cash flow generation and sustainability. Thanks for listening and thanks for your support. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP Exploration and Production; Ezra Yacob, EVP Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP of Marketing; and David Streit, VP Investor Relations and Public Relations. Here's Bill Thomas. Bill Thomas : Thanks Tim and good morning everyone. Our third quarter results underscore EOG's unique ability to organically create sustainable shareholder value through the commodity cycle. Along with substantial cost reductions and solid earnings results, we announced Dorado our new premium South Texas natural gas play. We also introduced a three-year reinvestment and production outlook. First, I want to highlight our stellar execution this year then provide some context on our capital allocation and three-year outlook. We continue to make rapid and sustainable improvements to our cost structure and capital efficiency through innovation while also improving the quality and size of our premium portfolio through exploration. Our results show we can invest in both innovation and exploration to improve the company, while also generating significant free cash flow improving the balance sheet and protecting the dividend. Capital spend for the third quarter was $2.7 billion over $300 million less than our revised plan had forecasted. In the third quarter, we substantially beat our cash unit cost targets as well as each of our oil, NGL, and natural gas production targets. As a result we have generated more than $930 million of free cash flow year-to-date already more than enough to cover the full year dividend. Our 21 Tcf Dorado natural gas play announced yesterday is a great example of EOG's ability to identify and capture high-quality rock and add substantial premium inventory to our organic exploration efforts. We believe Dorado will be one of the lowest cost and lowest emission natural gas plays in the U.S. with advantaged access to both domestic market hubs and international market via LNG. EOG has a long and successful exploration history and we continue to be excited about the potential of our current exploration portfolio. I'm incredibly proud of EOG employees' performance during this pandemic. They remain highly motivated and have demonstrated EOG's return-focused culture by improving the company at a record pace in a volatile environment. We will encourage -- we will emerge from this downturn an even stronger company positioning EOG to excel through the commodity price cycles. Yesterday, we also introduced a three-year outlook. The goals of disclosing this outlook are to provide more transparency into our capital allocation process and meaningful visibility into the next three years particularly given the ongoing level of uncertainty in the oil and gas market. Our capital and growth profile optimizes the total shareholder value of the company through the cycles. Our strategy remains dynamic and our operations are flexible enough to adjust our spending to match market conditions. At the bottom of the cycle as we find ourselves today we have no interest in growing oil into an overbalanced market. In an improved market, our disciplined growth strategy compounds the benefits of growth and continuous operational improvements to optimize returns and free cash flow potential and maximize long-term shareholder value. EOG represents a full-cycle investment opportunity. At lower prices, EOG is clearly a sustainable business. Maintenance capital and the dividend can be funded with oil in the mid-30s. In a more constructive market, EOG has significant leverage to higher oil prices through high-return reinvestment and significant incremental free cash flow. EOG has a unique business model in our industry. We approach this business differently which has become more apparent than ever with recent industry developments. First, the state of recent M&A activity stands in contrast to one of our most distinctive competitive advantages, organic exploration. Capturing high-quality rock is the primary way of improving the quality of our premium inventory. It's how we create more value than our competitors. Our newest play Dorado is a prime example. It's great rock in a great location and that's a resource you can't buy through M&A. Second, we're decentralized. Value is created in the field, not at headquarters. The exploration idea behind Dorado emerged bottom-up from one of our eight operating areas. In fact, perhaps for the first time in our history, every one of our eight areas has significant potential for premium plays, plays that if successful, will add to the top of our inventory not the bottom. Third, the improvements we're making are sustainable. The number one source of our cost reduction this year is from innovation, not cyclic service price reductions. Once again, that's the power of our decentralized organization. It's an innovation incubator and a driving force behind EOG's leading performance. Fourth, we execute our operational plans reliably and consistently. This year, we worked hard to provide transparency in our operations by providing guidance throughout one of the most volatile periods in the industry's history and we've delivered on our plan. Fifth, performance drives our ESG efforts, not PR. We believe the demand for oil and natural gas will gravitate towards the most efficient producers, the most efficient from a capital perspective and the most efficient from an emissions perspective. Our goal is to be part of the long-term global energy solution, while generating strong returns for our shareholders. Finally, and most importantly, we believe we have the most talented and motivated employees in the industry. We've not laid-off employees and we've empowered our workforce by leveraging our robust information technology infrastructure to support collaboration and innovation. Our employees and culture are a massive competitive advantage during these unusual times. And we're not standing still. Our relentless drive to improve means that, this is just a starting point. We are confident that we will continue to improve performance through the development of new plays like Dorado, further cost reductions and well productivity improvements. We're excited about the future of EOG. Now, here's Tim. Tim Driggers : Thanks, Bill. Our goal is to maximize shareholder value through the cycles. We measure our progress against a number of metrics, return on capital, free cash flow, sustainable dividend growth, operating cost and finding cost and financial leverage. We create business value through a balanced approach that maximizes returns as well as both current and future free cash flow generation. It's an integrated optimization exercise, not a simple formula. Reinvestment ratios and growth rates are outputs of this exercise. Our three-year outlook provided this quarter addresses the currently oversupplied market and assumes gradual improvement over the next three years. Our plan each year is based on conservative price assumptions. The pace of activity is optimized to generate high returns on incremental capital, increased return on capital employed, support improvements in operating efficiencies and technical advances and fund our free cash flow priorities. That said, our outlook is just that an outlook. We have operational flexibility to adapt quickly to changing supply demand conditions. At $50 oil, reinvesting 70% to 80% of discretionary cash flow, generates up to 10% oil growth, with significant free cash flow. At higher prices, we would expect to maintain this optimal level of activity and production growth, while returns and free cash flow expand significantly. But why grow at all? And how is the optimal growth rate determined? Volume growth drives higher ROCE, free cash flow potential and the fundamental driver of a growing sustainable dividend. Reinvesting in high-return wells with low operating and finding costs improves the company's recycle ratio, expanding our return and cash flow leverage. We have determined the optimal growth rate from our current assets through 2023 is about 8% to 10%. This pace of activity and growth maximizes the operational and capital efficiency of our current premium inventory. Due to the short payback periods of our investments, capital invested today is quickly recovered by free cash flow in the future. Relative to a lower growth scenario, the value of the additional cash flow we earn after the third year of our outlook far outweighs the incremental reinvestment to support our 8% to 10% plan. The proof is in our performance. During 2017 to 2019, EOG improved our return on capital employed, improved our return of capital through the dividend, reduced debt and grew production while reinvesting less than 80% of discretionary cash flow at $58 oil. Reinvesting at high returns and growing production, the last three years is the reason we believe EOG will generate more free cash flow over the next three years at $50 oil than we did at $58 oil. Sustainable dividend growth is our highest priority for returning cash to shareholders. It is a stream of cash flow that clearly demonstrates our confidence in the resiliency of our financial model and reinforces capital discipline. Strategically, free cash flow generated from higher oil prices, should be at least partially directed to shoring up the balance sheet to preserve financial flexibility for future downturns. Value preservation and value creation are two sides of the same coin when it comes to managing the balance sheet in a capital-intensive cyclical industry. This year has demonstrated the value of a strong balance sheet like no other and we worked hard to maintain our financial strength. Cash at the end of the third quarter was $3.1 billion offsetting total debt of $5.7 billion for a net debt to total capitalization ratio of 12%. We remain committed to pursuing our objective to strengthen our balance sheet further during upturns. Beyond the regular dividend and debt reduction we regularly review performance scenarios that may present options for additional cash return to shareholders. We haven't ruled out buybacks or a variable or special dividend and we'll consider all options for additional return of cash to shareholders when the opportunity presents itself. Next up is Billy to review our operational performance. Billy Helms : Thanks Tim. During the third quarter, we exceeded our volume expectations across the board while spending well below our forecasted capital. The capital savings were largely attributed to achieving our 12% well cost reduction target for the year. Our expectation for full year capital expenditures remains $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. The savings provided by our well cost reductions allows us to increase activity and exit the year near the level required to maintain production through 2021. Savings will also be used this year to invest in future value drivers for the company. Our organic exploration program is as active as ever and we are optimistic we can capture additional acreage at competitive pricing. That will further improve the quality of what we believe is already one of the best portfolios of assets in the industry. Finally, we are excited to initiate a number of infield innovations to improve our environmental performance. These projects have the potential to both reduce future emissions and improve efficiencies to generate a healthy return on capital. In the third quarter cash operating costs which includes LOE, transportation and gathering and processing expenses were 13% below target. LOE savings were generated across the board as we have streamlined our lease-up key practices and other facets of our production operations. We track about 100 different categories of LOE spending and 94 of these were flat to down in the third quarter compared to the second quarter on a per unit basis. We are excited about the steady improvements we continue to make. I am confident that most of the capital efficiency gains and operating cost reductions we are making this year will sustain into 2021. With current oil market fundamentals we plan to maintain flat oil production in 2021 at about 440,000 barrels per day which is where we expect to exit the fourth quarter this year. Capital required to maintain fourth quarter production throughout the year is about $3.4 billion. Due to sustainable cost reductions achieved this year, maintenance capital and the current dividend can now be funded with oil in the mid-30s. If oil prices allow additional funds will be allocated to : One, balanced activity across all of our premium plays including our new South Texas gas play Dorado and the Powder River Basin. Two, fund infrastructure investments that further improve our cost structure increase water reuse and reduce emissions; and three, advance both our domestic and international exploration opportunities. At $40 oil we can meet all of these priorities while spending within 80% of discretionary cash flow and comfortably funding our dividend. In late September, we published our 2019 sustainability report that details a number of step-change improvements to our performance on emissions, flaring, water use and safety. We reduced our total greenhouse gas intensity rate more than 15% improving emissions efficiency across all significant sources. For the second year in a row we reduced our methane intensity rate 45%, thanks to an effort to retrofit and remove pneumatic controllers and pumps in the field. We continue to find opportunities to reduce flaring. Our wellhead gas capture rate improved to 98.8% last year and we are on track to be over 99% this year. Freshwater volumes used in our operations declined nearly 30% as a result of significant expansion of our water reuse capabilities. And most importantly our safety rates both total recordable incidents and lost time incidents improved significantly. The goal of preparing this report every year is to clearly demonstrate how our ESG efforts are integrated into our strategy, planning and operations. In this year's report we want to step further with our commitments. We established longer-term targets for greenhouse gas and methane rate reductions. We have also set annual goals to reduce emission rates which are tied to executive compensation. At EOG our approach to ESG is performance-based. While we are committed to enhancing disclosure of our policies and metrics that are important to our operations we evaluate the success of our ESG efforts by performance and performance improvement. And just like every other area of our operations, we drive performance improvement through innovation. New ideas are coming from every corner of the company driven by passionate employees who are excited about the opportunity to invent new ways to lower emissions, reduce our freshwater use and make a stronger positive impact in the communities where we live and work. Finally, I want to thank our employees for maintaining focus in a volatile year. We have significantly reduced both well cost and cash unit operating cost. We kept a close eye on our environmental and safety performance. In fact, the trend indicates, we will once again improve wellhead gas capture rate and safety rates this year.  Constant experimentation, exceptional company-wide collaboration and a no-limits mindset are why I'm confident EOG will continue to lead the industry on performance and technology. Here's Ken to provide details on our newest play Dorado. Ken Boedeker : Thanks, Billy. We're excited to announce a major new natural gas discovery in the Western Gulf Coast Basin. Located in South Texas, Webb County we've named this discovery Dorado. With a breakeven cost of less than $1.25 per Mcf, we believe this play represents the lowest cost supply of natural gas in the United States.  We have identified an initial resource potential of 21 Tcf net to EOG in the Austin Chalk and Lower and Upper Eagle Ford formations. Both targets display premium level economics. At Henry Hub prices of $2.50 per Mcf Dorado competes directly with our premium oil plays. This play is a textbook example of how our exploration program is focused on adding to the top of our premium well inventory elevating the overall quality of our assets. We first identified the potential of the Austin Chalk formation as an oil play on top of our Eagle Ford footprint back in 2016. We have since completed about 100 gross Austin Chalk oil wells in that area capturing 59 million barrels of oil equivalent of reserve potential net to EOG. Shortly following that discovery, we began evaluating the Austin Chalk formation in the Gulf Coast Basin and identified its potential as a dry natural gas play in Webb County. Our current 163,000 net acre position is a combination of legacy acreage and new acreage captured through low-cost, organic leasing, trades and a bolt-on property acquisition. We believe our position covers the majority of the sweet spot of the play. We completed our first two wells in Dorado in January of 2019 targeting the Austin Chalk in the Eagle Ford. To further delineate the play and collect more data, we completed 15 more wells over the remainder of 2019. We paused our drilling activity during 2020 to evaluate both the production results and the significant amount of technical data we collected from cores, petrophysical logs and 3D seismic surveys. This data including a year's worth of production history from our drilled wells has generated a robust reservoir model giving us confidence in our resource estimates and projections for well performance. We are leveraging our proprietary knowledge built from prior plays to move quickly down the cost curve with our initial development. We currently estimate a finding cost of $0.39 per Mcf in the Austin Chalk and $0.41 in the Eagle Ford. Combined with EOG's low operating costs an advantaged market position located close to a number of major sales hubs in South Texas, access to pipelines to Mexico and several LNG export terminals, Dorado is in an ideal position to supply low-cost natural gas into markets with long-term growth potential. Dorado is dry gas with close proximity to multiple markets. Therefore, we expect Dorado's gas will have a lower carbon footprint than most other onshore gas plays in the U.S.  In addition, the recently formed Sustainable Power Group, we introduced last quarter is leveraging company-wide expertise to build out an operationally efficient and low emissions field. As we expand development of Dorado into a core asset, we expect it will help lower EOG's company-wide emissions intensity rate. In 2021, our preliminary plan is to turn about 15 net wells to sales with initial development targeting the Austin Chalk. Eagle Ford development where we are expecting lower drilling and completion costs will follow. The Eagle Ford utilizes a lower cost wellbore design optimized to a more forgiving drilling environment compared to the Austin Chalk.  In addition, we can leverage water and gas gathering infrastructure put in place for the Austin Chalk. We will evaluate the capital allocation to the South Texas gas play each year based on market conditions. Dorado adds 1,250 net locations on fee acreage to our premium inventory with 530 of those from the Austin Chalk and 720 from the Eagle Ford. These new premium Dorado locations along with approximately 150 new locations from other premium plays make up the 1,400 new net premium locations added in 2020 replacing three times what we drilled and more importantly, improving the overall quality of our portfolio. The number of wells in our premium inventory that have returns of 30% or more at $30 oil and $2.50 natural gas has now increased from 4,500 to 6,000 wells. We also divested the remainder of our Marcellus Shale position during the third quarter for proceeds of about $130 million. The sale of this non-core sub-premium asset will fund much of Dorado's development capital next year and upgrades the quality of our gas portfolio. This is a great example of how EOG's organic exploration strategy and disciplined capital management creates significant shareholder value. Now I'll turn it over to Bill for concluding remarks. Bill Thomas : Thanks, Ken. In conclusion, I'd like to note the following important takeaways. Number one, EOG continues to significantly lower cost operating costs and well costs with sustainable technology and efficiency gains. The company will emerge from the downturn a much lower-cost company. Number two, our organic exploration effort delivers another significant industry-leading play. We believe EOG's Dorado and natural gas play will be one of the highest margin and lowest emission gas plays in the U.S. Dorado is an example of how our robust exploration portfolio will continue to lower the cost structure and improve the future capital efficiency of the company. Number three, our multiple year outlook is designed to deliver industry-leading financial performance and free cash flow. It's a balanced strategy that maximizes total shareholder value through the cycle. EOG represents a full-cycle investment opportunity with significant leverage to higher oil prices. Number four, EOG is a leader in innovative initiatives to lower GHG and methane emissions. Every aspect of ESG is embedded in and driven by EOG's talented and return-focused culture. New ideas are coming from every corner of the company driven by passionate employees who are excited about making our environment and communities a better place to live. EOG is committed to being a leader in the future of energy. And finally, EOG's third quarter results demonstrate our unique and sustainable organic business model, whether it's exploration, operations, information technology or ESG performance. Our culture-driven value creation throughout the company has never been better. EOG's ability to maximize long-term shareholder value through the cycles has never been stronger. Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from an Arun Jayaram, pardon me, with JPMorgan. Please\u2026 Arun Jayaram : [Technical Difficulty] on your 2021 outlook and how you're thinking about the incremental investments that you highlighted on the slide beyond the $3.4 billion sustaining number. And any preliminary thoughts on mix, as it does sound like you'll be shifting some activity amongst the premium plays to the PRB and Dorado? Bill Thomas : Yes. Thanks, Arun. I'm going to ask Billy to comment on that. Billy Helms : Yeah. Good morning Arun. Just to make sure, I understood your question. I guess for the 2021 outlook, our maintenance capital as we've stated was about $3.4 billion. We are likely to evaluate. It's early yet to say what our capital might look like next year, but we'll certainly do the same as we always have. We'll allocate it based on our outlook at oil prices at the beginning of the year of course. And as we move into that year, we have certainly a lot of flexibility to allocate between our different plays. So as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we can fund our maintenance capital and our dividend down to oil prices in the mid-30s. So as we see oil prices moderate either above that level or wherever they might be, we'll have flexibility to allocate capital to our new play Dorado and the Powder River Basin as we explained in our prepared remarks. Arun Jayaram : Okay. Fair enough. But you did say Billy at $40 oil, you could reinvest 80% of -- or have an 80% reinvestment rate and cover the dividend and some of these incremental investments. Is that... Billy Helms : Yes, that's true. Arun Jayaram : Is that fair? Billy Helms : Yes. Well I'm sorry we missed the first part of your question, so I apologize. Arun Jayaram : No problem, no problem. And just my follow-up maybe for Tim. EOG has historically been pretty conservative on the oil and gas prices that underpin your outlook. So some question from investors on just the rationale for using $50 per barrel. I know it is a bit longer term, but which is quite a bit above the strip. And maybe if you could help sensitize those future growth outlooks if we assumed call it a $40 to $45 WTI type number? Bill Thomas : Yes, Arun, this is Bill. Yes, the outlook $50 is how we ran the model to determine how to optimize the company and what the most important parameters are. But I wouldn't get too hung up on $50. Whether it's $45 or $50 or $55, the fundamentals of the outlook stay the same. We're focused on returns. The first thing that we have to determine each year are the market fundamentals. Is the market still in an overbalanced situation? If it still is, we don't want to force oil into that situation. But if it's a balanced market and it turns out at $45 oil, certainly we believe the 8% to 10% growth rate, the reinvestment rate of 70% to 80%, the focus on optimizing returns and compounding the growth with operational improvements and margin improvements, and maximizing current and future free cash flow, and doing all that to maximize the total shareholder value of the company. And so the guidelines really apply to almost any price that would be in a balanced market. Arun Jayaram : Great. Thanks, Bill. Operator : The next question comes from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Leo Mariani : Hey, guys. Just wanted to kind of ask a couple of things just surrounding Dorado. If memory serves me correctly this seems to be kind of EOG's first kind of major foray into a gas play, probably harkening back to sort of the 2003, 2004 time frame where I think you guys made a concerted effort to kind of move more to oil plays based on the macro, which was certainly the right decision over that period of time. Just wanted to get a sense, are you guys sensing that there may be some shifting macro dynamics on the gas side, which can make the Dorado play something that becomes a lot more meaningful in the years to come? You guys did outline 15 wells for 2021, which in the grand scheme of things given EOG's size doesn't seem like a big number. I just wanted to kind of get your sense on how that can play out over the next few years. Bill Thomas : Yeah, Leo. I think the first thing is, we've had a premium price deck. It's based on $40 flat oil and $2.50 flat gas prices. And so any kind of play that would have premium economics 30% rate of return at those flat prices, that's okay with us. We're not particular on the commodity, whether it's gas or oil or even a combo play. So that's the first thing. And then the second thing is, yes, we do believe that gas has got a prominent future in the future energy supply. There's no doubt about that. And this play just happens to be, we believe the best -- one of the best play, the best play probably dry gas play onshore U.S. It is a fantastic play and it's really driven primarily through the extremely high rock quality of the Austin Chalk. And so it fits everything we're looking for in the company. It upgrades our portfolio. It gives us more exposure to gas going forward. It gives us a lot of optionality in the future to switch capital between types of plays as commodities prices might vary a little bit. But all of it is based on our premium price deck $40 flat and $2.50 flat gas and this one certainly generates super high returns at $2.50 flat gas. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's great color. And just focusing on third quarter for a second. It certainly looks like EOG beat production guidance pretty handily, but it did also look like that the shut-ins that you had were actually slightly higher than you projected for the quarter. So just wanted to get a sense of what kind of drove the better than expected third quarter production performance? Bill Thomas : Billy? Billy Helms : Yeah Leo. This is Billy. So yes, we -- the outperformance is really driven by -- and you touched on it there the shut-in wells bringing those back on production. As we brought the wells back on production that had been shut in for some time, we exhibited some amount of flush production from those wells, as we've talked about before. And then the second part of that is, we did start bringing on a few newly completed wells and those outperformed our type curves. So that's really kind of what drove the two parts of our beat on the volumes. Leo Mariani : Okay. Thanks for the color. Operator : The next question is from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Singer : Thank you. Good morning. Wanted to ask on the maintenance capital of $3.4 billion. This is the number you've been talking about for the last couple of quarters, and I think you were a bit more upfront. And I think it was slide 8 of talking about in an ideal world some of the potential other additional investments, you want to fund. And I wondered if you could kind of quantify what that -- what those would represent the ESG exploration, cost structure improvements and balancing activity, how much is a normal level of spending there? And then potentially to offset that, I think you've talked in the past that cost savings and efficiencies and cost reductions for the last couple of quarters are not included in the $3.4 billion. What would that represent in -- based on today's cost structure? Billy Helms : Yes. Good morning, Brian. This is Billy. So our $3.4 billion maintenance capital, you're right. You are correct. It did not -- it does not anticipate any improvements in our cost structure on a go-forward basis. It's based on our current existing cost. So that's the first thing. And then as far as the amount of capital over and above that, we'll -- as we go into the year, I think, we're trying to provide a little bit of a framework on how we would think about allocating capital. As we look into next year based on the outlook for oil prices, we're just looking at merely maintaining our exit rate into the next -- in the fourth quarter into next year. So if oil prices moderate above or below where they are today, we'll look at how much money we can spend on these types of other projects, the infrastructure or exploration-related activities, or ESG-focused projects in relation to what that oil price indicates and stay within our guidance of spending certainly within a 70% to 80% of our discretionary cash flow. So that's kind of the outline, the framework. So it really -- it's a little bit early to speculate on what that magnitude of that dollar might be. Brian Singer : Got it. Thanks. And then, my follow-up is, with regards to the exploration portfolio. And if we look at the plays you've announced in recent quarters, Trinidad and the Dorado play, they've been more natural gas focused. And I wondered if you could characterize the exploration optimism from here, or at least the exploration portfolio from here, on oily versus wet gas versus dry gas plays and how you see that playing out over the next year or two. Ezra Yacob : Yes. Brian, this is Ezra. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I think, as Bill highlighted, really what we start with that exploration program, our focus right now is to find plays where we can capture the sweet spot acreage positions in those plays. And we're looking for plays that are really going to be additive to the front end of our inventory. So as we've talked about, we've got multiple exploration plays we're currently evaluating. And we just don't want to build a deeper inventory, but really strengthen that inventory. And if we look at what we've done this year, our -- the minimum rate of return on our 11,500 premium well inventory generates a 30% direct after-tax return at $40 oil and $2.50 flat natural gas price. But in this year's program, we've illustrated the significant value of focusing on the top end of our inventory. And we've delivered lower well costs and production outperformance and high-grading our investment criteria, to focus on the upper half of that inventory. And so, said another way, our 60% premium rate of return median well inventory will pay out approximately twice as fast as a 30% rate of return well. And so, our emphasis on organic exploration has always been a key to our success and it continues to be how we sustainably replace what we drill every year in our inventory. The Austin Chalk announcement today, I think, provides a very good example of what a higher rock quality can do in this exploration effort. The Austin Chalk is really more of a hybrid play, so it shares characteristics of unconventional and conventional reservoirs. And when we apply our technology, our data collection on core and log, to really identify the sweet spot landing zones that will react very well to our horizontal completions technology, that's when we really have -- that's when we really get excited and see the power that these hybrid plays can add. As we translate that into oil plays, we expect a very good outperformance with these hybrid zones. And we should be able to see a shallowing decline profile and lower finding and development costs, as we move forward into those. Brian Singer : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeanine Wai : Hi. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on the base decline. I think in the 2022, 2023 outlook you now anticipate that BOE growth will outpace oil growth. And I think some of that is related to Trinidad and Dorado. But how does the oil base decline trend in your 8% to 10% per year growth rate scenario? And is that level of growth enough to kind of allow the base to moderate? Bill Thomas : Yes. Hi, Jeanine. I'll ask Billy to comment on that. Billy Helms : Yes. Good morning, Jeanine. Yes, I think you're correct. The base decline from the oil properties is moderating over time. That's a function of really the activity levels this year and -- but also the quality of the inventory that we're bringing to production. The better quality rocks just simply have a lower decline over time. So it's really those two things that are helping to moderate the oil base decline. And, certainly, the outlook that we have with our maintenance capital is sufficient to maintain that on a go-forward basis. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Great. That's very helpful. Thank you. My follow-up question is, maybe dovetailing on a few of the other ones about the other CapEx that is going to be included in the 2021 outlook. So on the potential investments on slide eight that you list, we know that the amount of CapEx will depend on the headroom that you have in oil prices. I think I heard you say that previously. But can you comment on how that 2021 amount might compare to prior years? But I guess more specifically, how much of that other CapEx is really embedded in that $50 2022-2023 outlook? Thank you. Billy Helms : Yes. Jeanine this is Billy, again. You're right. The level of how much we spend on those different categories will certainly depend on the oil price. And I'd say, there is some amount of that baked into the $50 estimate in the outer years, but it's not a major portion of our capital spend. So it's -- I'd say, it's in keeping with what we've done in the years past. Jeanine Wai : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Bob Brackett : Hi. Good morning. You've gone quite down dip in Dorado. And those 9,000-foot laterals imply some of these wells are approaching four miles measured depth. And so it seems cost control is absolutely critical. Is there some innovation there to share with us? Bill Thomas : Yeah. Bob I'm going to ask Ken to comment on that. Ken Boedeker : Yeah Bob, this is Ken. We have a significant history of developing the Austin Chalk in addition to the Eagle Ford, up dip in the oil window. So we've also had 17 wells that we've drilled in that area, that have provided excellent results. And we haven't had many drilling issues or completion issues to deal with. So, keeping the costs in those areas are anticipated to be, what we've shown right now in our 2021 program. So it looks like the -- we have a very, very good confidence that we'll be able to generate those returns. We've shown that are competitive with our other premium oil plays at $2.50. Bob Brackett : So I'll do a combo follow-up. So it's not sort of managed pressure drilling say like the Powder River? And then my follow-up would be, you mentioned domestic and international exploration activities in that seriatim, that people keep referring to. Could you remind us of what is included in the international bucket? Ezra Yacob : Yes. Bob this is Ezra. On the international front, I'd highlight we did just recently wrap up our recent drilling campaign in Trinidad with some additional outstanding results. We highlighted some of the discoveries, on the last call. But I'd follow-up and say, our most recent completion the Oilbird -- a well off the Oilbird platform came on in the third quarter at over 60 million cubic feet a day of natural gas with an additional 2,500 barrels of condensate per day. We brought on a well off of our Kitscoty platform, that's cleaning up right now, its flow back rates of approximately 30 million cubic feet, per day of gas. And so we continue to be excited about the discoveries that we made during this campaign and look forward to sharing future results, from this high-return asset. And then also during the third quarter, we entered into the country of Oman, with the acquisition of about 4.6 million net acres in Block 36. Block 36 is in the southwest portion of the country. It's located in the Rub Al Khali basin, which is a well-known hydrocarbon-bearing basin. And as -- we've been looking really outside the U.S. for the right opportunity to apply, our expertise in tight oil development, and we view Oman is really offering that. They offer a very low geopolitical risk, and they offer access to competitively priced oilfield services and equipment, that we think is going to be required to make tight oil successful. And so as part of the agreement, we plan to drill two test wells in the next two years to evaluate the potential of the acreage. And we're very excited about the low-cost of entry in Oman and the option to evaluate a basin with significant potential upside. And I think, maybe Ken could add some color in addition to that. Ken Boedeker : Yeah. I just -- I wanted to clarify something Bob. When you talked about managed pressure drilling like the Powder River Basin, we are doing managed pressure drilling like the Powder River Basin, in Dorado. But we have a significant amount of experience doing that across several plays in the company. Bob Brackett : Great. Thanks for all that. Operator : The next question comes from Subash Chandra with Northland Securities. Please go ahead. Subash Chandra : Yeah. Hi, everybody. Just doing some, I guess, bar napkin math, using your decline rates and the dollar for flowing capital efficiency calculation. I'm coming up with, I don't know maybe around $5 billion for what CapEx requirements are, for 10% type oil growth. Do you think I'm in the right ballpark there? Billy Helms : Yeah Subash, this is Billy Helms. It's a little premature to maybe give out a directional number, but I think you can approximate. With the data we've given you, I think you can derive some pretty close estimates. I'd say you're probably not too far off the right numbers. Subash Chandra : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then secondly just on, dividend decision. I guess the next one comes up, early part of the New Year. I'm just curious the $3 billion in cash, you talked about having the right balance sheet cushion to ride out the cycles. From a, cash perspective, is there a right number that we should be assuming? And is it and should we also assume that the cash does not go into the dividend decision, that the dividend decision is just derived from operating cash flows or free cash flows? Tim Driggers : This is Tim. And you're exactly right. It is the operating cash flows, that determines the -- a sustained dividend. As far as the $3 billion in cash, we do have a bond coming due in February. And currently we are anticipating being able to pay that bond off with that cash. But we have significant flexibility if the market changes to do whatever we need to do. So, we're in a good position to manage that situation. Subash Chandra : Okay. And to ask it a different way, should we assume some sort of minimum cash that you'd want to keep on the balance sheet? Tim Driggers : There -- again, we evaluate it depending on the conditions at the time. So, to give you a number there's not a number I can give you. It all depends on what the stock -- I mean, the price of the commodities are at the time, as to how much cash we need to have on the balance sheet. And also what our budget is, our capital budget and how much capital we'll be spending. Subash Chandra : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Paul Cheng : Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Just curious that when you look at the three-year outlook for your capital allocation and the growth target or that the maximum growth ceiling, should we assume that that's also applied for the longer term? And if notm is there any reason that the same will not be applied? Bill Thomas : Yes, Paul I think three years with those parameters are a good guide. We did include - we did not include any additional well cost, operational cost advancements in those projections. So certainly, we expect to continue to do that. We have a very sustainable model of being able to do that. So as time goes on and certainly in three years we expect we'll be a lot better company. So I wouldn't just apply those numbers to what we could do four years from now. I think we're hopeful we'll \u2013 through these exploration efforts getting better rock and continuing to reduce our costs we should be a much better company. Paul Cheng : Well I'm sure that the company will be operationally much stronger. I'm more referring to that is the ceiling of 10% growth is a variable over the longer term or that is only applied for the next two or three years? Bill Thomas : Yes I think right now it's just for the next two or three years. We'll just have to evaluate where the company is in the four or five years from now and see where we are. Paul Cheng : And then my second question is that on \u2013 whether it's the Dorado or that your overall CapEx spending certainly that the price signal is important. But with the future strip moving quite substantially from one day to another so that's probably not a very good indicator or at least let's say a forecast vehicle. So what are the factors that you guys are using maybe that's more determinating how you decide on your program for a particular year if the price signal from the future market are unreliable there as we can see? Bill Thomas : Yes, Paul I think the first thing is what's the price based on and that's whether we're in an overbalanced market situation or a balanced market. And we believe there's significant structural changes obviously have been going on in the business particularly in the U.S. with a lot more capital discipline, a lot more return of cash to shareholders. They need to work on balance sheet consolidation, et cetera. In the international arena, there's been folks that have basically changed their business philosophy and they're certainly not going to be investing as much in oil in the future. So there's a lot of things that go on in there. And all that leads to \u2013 in the future, certainly we believe OPEC will be the swing producer the \u2013 really totally in control of oil prices. So we want to take that in consideration and make sure that the market is balanced. And we've taken all that in consideration as we formulate our plans. Paul Cheng : Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Bill I'm really just looking for a little clarification on a couple of the things you've announced today. First of all, the beginning of the year you talked about your cash breakeven being around $40. Second quarter you said it was a little less than $40. Now it's dropped to the mid-30s. Can you tell us what's changed there given that the sustaining capital is still $3.4 billion? Bill Thomas : I'll ask Billy to comment on that. Billy Helms : Yes. Good morning, Doug it's really the cost structure of the company continues to improve. We continue to drive down our well cost. As I mentioned earlier we've already achieved our 12% cost reduction that we expected throughout the year. And then our unit costs, we've driven down our unit operating costs quite substantially this year. So those combination of things is allowing us to continue to reduce that breakeven cost. Doug Leggate : Is the gas price a factor Billy? Billy Helms : No sir, it's really not. It's really driven mainly by the cost reductions, the structural changes we've made and the cost reductions of the company. Doug Leggate : Okay. My follow-up is really, Bill I hate to do it but go back to the 10% growth number. I know you've been asked a lot about it today. But I want to put a hypothetical to you. So let's assume oil is $50 but it's only there because Saudi is still \u2013 or OPEC+ has still got seven million barrels off the market. That's not exactly a balanced market. So what does EOG do in that scenario? Bill Thomas : Yes, Doug, that's exactly right. We would not want to force oil into that kind of situation. We don't want to put OPEC in a situation where they feel threatened like we're taking market share, while they're propping up oil prices. So that much commitment by them that's not a time we would force oil. Doug Leggate : That's the clarity I was looking for. Thanks so much, guys. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from Paul Sankey with Sankey Research. Please go ahead. Paul Sankey : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Guys, could you -- on the Dorado, could you give us an activity and volume outlook to help us with valuation? And given it's an organic success, could you just talk a bit about your perspective on the consolidation that we've seen in the sector from EOG's point of view? Thanks. Ken Boedeker : Yeah. Paul, this is Ken. On Dorado's volume and activity outlook, it's a little early to give any volume outlook for 2021 or the future years. We have talked about a 15-well program in 2021 that we should be bringing on some gas early in the year and then towards the second half of the year from there. As far as M&A... Billy Helms : Yeah. Paul, this is Billy. I'll touch maybe on the M&A question. I think -- certainly, I think the industry needed to go through some M&A some consolidation in the space. And I think we're certainly supportive of what we've seen so far. For EOG, we've looked at just about every possible combination that's out there. And we certainly understand the financial uplift or the accretion that you might get from a corporate M&A, but we look at that more as a one-time event. And we're really looking -- for us to be entering that market, we would look at the longer-term impact that a possible M&A would have on our current inventory. And so we look at the inventory that a company might have in comparison to the inventory, we already have or what we're seeing in our exploration program, and we just don't see anything that we're -- we need to allocate any funds to at this point in time. There nothing that really meets our objectives. And I guess it just stems from the fact we have such a high level of confidence in our current exploration program, which is mainly aimed at improving the quality of our premium inventory. Paul Sankey : Thought you might say that Billy. The follow-up is you've adjusted your framework somewhat here. Could you just talk about your philosophy on hedging the latest -- if anything's changed regarding how you think about hedging? And I'll leave it there. Thank you. Bill Thomas : Yeah. Paul thanks. Yeah, we haven't changed our philosophy there. We're always opportunistic. We have a very robust, rigorous commodity analysis macro view. We're working all the time. It's quite a rigorous process. So we believe we're not always right, but we believe we've got a pretty good idea where oil prices are headed. So we'll just stay opportunistic on that, and same thing with gas prices. Paul Sankey : Which is -- so you're less hedged right now? Bill Thomas : Sorry. What was the question? I'm sorry I missed it. Paul Sankey : Which is to, say, that you're less hedged right now? Bill Thomas : Yeah. That's right. We're not hedged on oil. Paul Sankey : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead. Charles Meade : Good morning, Bill, to you and your whole team there. I just wanted to ask a question kind of pull on the thread about this Dorado -- the Dorado play you have. The Austin Chalk, the D&C cost you put for the Austin Chalk is a little higher, I believe for -- than the Eagle Ford did. And I'm just kind of wondering, what's the driver of that? Is the Austin Chalk in a -- is it perspective in a deeper session, or is the lateral a little slower to drill, or what -- is that a relevant piece of the puzzle? And what does it point to? Ken Boedeker : Yeah. Charles, this is Ken. We just see a little bit harder drilling conditions when we're drilling the Austin Chalk compared to the Eagle Ford, so we've added in additional cost for that at this point. We always work on lowering our cost basis, and you can see that on every one of our plays. So we anticipate that we'll be able to lower the cost in Dorado as well as we drill some additional wells in that play. Charles Meade : Got it. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, I wanted to touch on the Delaware Basin. It's still a big driver for you guys obviously. Are you guys seeing anything different, or do you expect to see anything different either in the operating environment out there or the opportunity set to continue to add out there? Billy Helms : Yeah. Charles, this is Billy. Really nothing's changed, except our continuous improvement we're seeing in the well performance and the cost structure of our Delaware Basin plays. We're extremely proud of the team we have there and the improvements they continue to make. We haven't really changed a lot as far as the well spacing or anything like that, that a lot of other companies talk about. I think we continue to make improvements in the way we drill and complete the wells. And I think we're delivering a lot more consistent results as a result of that. So, we're extremely confident in our ability to continue to execute that program and deliver superior results. We are continuing to have success in blocking up acreage through trades and we've been doing that really for many years. So I don't expect that's going to continue to change. But outside of that that's kind of what we see. Charles Meade : Great, thanks a lot. Operator : At this time, the question-and-answer session is concluded. I will turn the conference over now to Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO for concluding remarks. Bill Thomas : Yeah. In closing, I'd just like to say, we cannot be more proud of our EOG employees. Our third quarter results were outstanding, thanks to everyone in the company. The culture of EOG is performing better than ever, and our ability and commitment to creating long-term shareholder value has never been stronger. Thanks for listening, and thanks for your support. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Tim Driggers, chief financial officer. Please go ahead, sir. Tim Driggers : Good morning, and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions, as well as reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call or in the accompanying investor presentation slides may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our earnings release issued yesterday. Participating on the call this morning are; Bill Thomas, chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, chief operating officer; Ezra Yacob, president; Ken Boedeker, EVP, exploration and production; Lance Terveen, senior VP marketing; and David Streit, VP, investor and public relations. Here's Bill Thomas Bill Thomas : Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Last year was historic, and we were tested like never before. In a challenging environment, I am proud to say our EOG employees who personify our unique culture responded exceptionally without a beat. I'd like to thank our employees for delivering such outstanding performance. We generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow, earned adjusted net income of $850 million and ended the year with $3.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We increased our sustainable dividend rate by 30% and shored up what was already an industry-leading balance sheet to a low 11% net debt-to-cap ratio. We lowered our finding and development cost, improved our capital efficiency and earned a direct after-tax rate of return of more than 50%, with an all-in after-tax rate of return of 25% based on our premium price deck of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. Such extraordinary results in a $39 oil price environment were made possible by our shift five years ago to our premium strategy, which established an investment hurdle rate of 30% direct after-tax rate of return using flat $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas prices. Using such a stringent hurdle rate shields the company from cyclic oil and gas prices. 2020 was a true test of that shield, and that is a testament to the power of our premium strategy. Beyond delivering stellar financial results last year, we continued to invest in long-term value of the company. Through our low-cost organic efforts, we added 1,500 net premium locations to our inventory, including 1,250 from the newest addition to our portfolio, Dorado, a South Texas natural gas play with 21 Tcf of net resource potential at a breakeven price of less than $1.25 per Mcf. We believe Dorado is one of the lowest cost and lowest emissions natural gas fields in the U.S. and expands EOG's portfolio of assets that we believe will play a significant role in the long-term global energy solution. We also completed two pilots of infield technology to reduce emissions, a hybrid solar and natural gas-powered compressor station that reduces combustion emissions and a closed-loop gas capture system to reduce force flaring as a result of downstream market interruptions. Reducing flaring is an industrywide priority, and we plan to publish our closed-loop gas capture technology for others to replicate. We entered the next phase of the cycle a much improved company. With the countless, creative and innovative ideas we implemented in 2020, we're in the process of making significant improvements to EOG's future performance. Looking forward, the following six steps summarize the foundation for our 2021 plan and outlook for the next three years. Number one, maintain fourth-quarter 2020 production. There is no reason to consider growth until the market rebalances. Signs of an earlier recovery will not change our $3.9 billion 2021 capital plan. Number two, shift to a double-premium drilling program. Our focus on increasing returns never waivers, and this year is no exception. We're raising the investment standard again. Double-premium wells earn 60% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas and make up the top half of our 23-year drilling inventory. Shifting to double premium will make another step-change in our future performance by delivering higher returns, lower decline rates and more free cash flow potential. We have more than 10 years of double-premium inventory and are optimistic we will replace double-premium locations faster than we drill them. Number three, accelerate new exploration projects. Last year, our exploration program focused on technical evaluations across numerous new prospects. We're excited to resume a more robust leasing and testing effort this year. We're evaluating a large number of double-premium oil plays in the U.S. and internationally with the potential to deliver low finding costs and development costs and low production decline rates. The focus of our exploration program is to continue to improve the quality of our inventory and EOG's total shareholder value. Number four, raise the bar again on our ESG performance and ambitions. After achieving significant improvements in safety, emissions and water performance in 2020, we have announced our ambition to reach net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2040. As one of the steps along the way, we expect to eliminate routine flaring by 2025. We believe this is possible using creative applications of current and future technology. We're currently implementing internally developed technology with a goal of measuring granular real-time emissions data for all facilities in the company. This will encourage innovation and development of unique solutions to achieve our net zero ambition. Number five, resume moderate production growth only when the market is balanced. Assuming a balanced market by year-end, we are positioned to grow oil 8% to 10% in 2022 and 2023. We forecast that our shifting well mix toward double premium will lower our base decline rate to less than 25% within five years from 34% last year. This optimal growth rate delivers the most long-term total value by delivering higher returns, lower decline rates and more free cash flow over the long term. And number six, generate significant free cash flow. All cash allocation decisions are focused on enhancing total long-term shareholder value. Our top priorities for free cash flow are to sustainably grow the dividend and reduce debt. Beyond these priorities, when excess cash materializes, we will evaluate other options opportunistically, such as supplemental dividends, share repurchases and low-cost property additions. With our deep inventory of double-premium locations, moderating decline rates and sustainable cost reductions, EOG's free cash flow potential is improving significantly. Before I turn it over to Billy, I want to address our thoughts on federal acreage. From the statements made by the current administration, we believe that our current existing federal leases and corresponding federal drilling inventory can be fully developed. EOG is well prepared to manage through any regulatory changes that could impact the pace of development on federal acreage. The combination of our large number of federal permits in hand, our flexibility to pivot within our deep inventory of double-premium locations and our ability to add new inventory through organic exploration gives us the confidence that the future performance of the company will not be affected. Now here's Billy. Billy Helms : Thanks, Bill. Let me start by expressing my warmest appreciation to all of our employees. I am truly amazed by their talent, commitment and resiliency as demonstrated by the dramatic improvements achieved in 2020. Within weeks of publishing our initial 2020 capital plan, we quickly cut capital by scaling back activity by nearly half. To protect the company's financial strength, our employees responded with urgency and purpose, finding new ways to sustainably reduce our well cost structure further. What stands out the most to me is how the EOG culture of innovation and multidisciplinary collaboration and teamwork increased at a time when everyone was working remotely to protect themselves, their families and their communities. The results of that innovation and teamwork can be seen clearly in our 2020 operational performance. We significantly improved our capital efficiency by reducing total well cost 15% and per unit cash operating cost 4%. With respect to our year-end reserves and excluding the low impact of low commodity prices, we reduced finding and development costs 15% to a low of $6.98 per barrel of oil equivalent and replaced nearly 160% of our 2020 production. The speed with which we spread technical innovations directed at lowering cost and improving well performance throughout the company has increased. We believe the communication challenge presented by remote work and the teamwork required between individual operational areas to execute our significantly revised plan last year inspired what we believe will be a permanent improvement in how we integrate new learnings and innovations companywide. Our operational execution fired on all cylinders during 2020, reaching our stretch goal to reduce well costs 15% last year with about three-quarters of that coming from sustainable efficiency improvements. We expect to maintain this momentum and reduce well cost another 5% this year. We also expect to carry sustainable operating cost reductions into 2021. Our reductions to LOE during 2020 remarkably outpaced the volume reductions and shut-in production as a result of exceptionally low commodity pricing. We reduced LOE 22% on a total-dollar basis versus 8% decline in production volumes. Shutting in volumes afforded us the opportunity to take a closer look at our maintenance and workover programs and streamline our lease upkeep practices, resulting in sustainable cost reductions. We finished the year with fourth-quarter oil production at a little over 440,000 barrels of oil per day and having spent $3.5 billion of capital, exactly what we forecasted back in May when we revised our plan in response to the downturn in oil prices. We increased our rig count from a low of five rigs last summer and are now running about 24 rigs to support a 2021 program that will maintain essentially flat oil volumes. The rig count is currently at the high point, and it will drift down throughout the year to an average of about 22 rigs. Looking back to when we introduced the premium strategy in 2016, our per unit cash operating costs have declined by 18%, and our per foot well costs are down about 40%. This operational excellence has enabled EOG to raise the bar further and target double premium as our new investment standard. With such significant progress the past five years and the momentum we are carrying, I'm convinced we are only just getting started at being one of the lowest-cost energy suppliers. We also made significant strides in our ESG performance in 2020. First, on the safety side, our total recordable incident rate, the primary safety metric, improved more than 25%. Safety is always our first priority, and we continue to focus on ways to enhance our safety culture even further. On the environmental side, we increased the percent of reused water used in our operation to about 45% of our supply and significantly reduced total barrels of freshwater used. And we increased our already-strong wellhead gas capture rate from 98.8% in 2019 to an astounding 99.6% in 2020. Our ambitions for the future are a reflection of that performance. We have set a goal to raise the wellhead gas capture rate to 99.8% in 2021 and achieve zero routine flaring by 2025. We're literally fighting for the last remaining 0.1 percentage point now. Longer term, we have set an ambition to be net zero in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2040. Ultimately, it is our highly creative and passionate employees that gives me confidence in this aspiration. In the past five years, we have achieved a number of technical innovations and operational advancements that have enabled us to generate significant reductions in methane and overall GHG intensity rates to date. Our approach to emissions reductions remains operationally focused, investing with returns in mind and seeking achievable and scalable results. Our investments in projects such as closed-loop gas capture and solar-powered compression pay off in two ways; they lower emissions and function as learning mechanisms for future innovation. We know that to be part of the long-term energy solution, we not only have to be low cost; we have to do it with one of the lowest environmental footprints. Our newly formed Sustainable Power Group is working to identify low emissions power generation solutions and accelerate innovations to support our missions, goals and ambitions. I'm excited about all the innovation occurring in the company, and that gives me confidence we can achieve our goals and ambitions. Finally, I want to take a minute to express my sincere gratitude for the tireless efforts of our production and marketing teams in the wake of the severe winter weather event last week. The teams worked in difficult conditions without any safety incidents to manage the production interruptions caused by extensive freezing weather and delivered as much critical production to our downstream customers as possible. All of our production is now back online, and we expect our average daily production in the first quarter to be reduced by about 4%. Beginning with the onset of the storm, the production staff also worked in close coordination with our marketing team who communicated with our downstream customers to redirect natural gas production in Texas to local distribution companies that deliver natural gas to heat homes and to utilities for electric power generation. These efforts supported by critical -- these efforts supported critical human needs throughout the Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, Austin, Houston and other Central and East Texas communities. Further, in line with our core values at EOG, we sold these redirected gas shipments at prices consistent with those received prior to the winter weather event rather than high and volatile daily spot prices. Through it all, the EOG culture of interdisciplinary teamwork and nonbureaucratic decision-making, technology leadership and commitment to do the right thing shone through, and I couldn't be more proud of everyone involved. Here's Ezra for an update on our exploration efforts. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Billy. Our organic exploration focus has always been the driver behind successfully replacing what we drill every year with better inventory. Our current effort is built around adding plays with shallower decline rates that also meet our double-premium hurdle rate, ultimately offering higher capital efficiency than our existing inventory. Dorado, the South Texas natural gas play we announced late last year, is the most recent example of EOG creating shareholder value through low-cost organic exploration. Early entry and capture of a high-quality reservoir across a contiguous acreage position with access to low-cost services and proximity to multiple markets is the recipe for a high-return investment opportunity and is exactly the type of prospect we're looking for. Our strong financial position, combined with our proprietary database of unconventional plays, has positioned us to capitalize countercyclically and capture exploration opportunities with little to no competition. We are focused on oil, and we are in the process of drilling and testing high-potential prospects. We are optimistic we can prove up a number of them and capture additional acreage at competitive pricing that will further improve the quality of what we believe is already one of the best portfolios of assets in the industry. Our vision is to develop double-premium oil plays in each operating area, including international. This is highly efficient and allows us to allocate capital across a wide array of plays to optimize returns and capital efficiency. This decentralized multi-basin approach is a hallmark of EOG, one that leverages our competitive advantages in exploration, technology and low-cost operations, all benefiting from knowledge transfer between the basins. The results, if we are successful, will flow through our financials with higher return on capital employed, lower operating costs, higher capital efficiency, shallower declines and even more free cash flow. When we look back at this time several years from now, I'm confident we will recognize 2021 as a step-change in EOG's performance and financial profile, much like we look back on our shift to premium drilling in 2016. Here's Tim to review our financial position. Tim Driggers : Thanks, Ezra. EOG's financial performance in 2020 demonstrates the resiliency of our business model and portfolio of high-return assets. In response to the lower oil prices caused by the price war and pandemic, we elected to utilize our operational flexibility to quickly cut activity. Levered by the sustainable cost deductions that Billy discussed, we reduced capex in 2020 by 44% to $3.5 billion. The result was $1.6 billion of free cash flow, a great performance in what we certainly hope will prove to be the bottom of the cycle year. The board of directors voted to increase the dividend by 10% to an annual rate of $1.65 per share. EOG's dividend has grown at a compounded annual rate of 20% over the last 21 years. This reflects the continued improvement in the profitability and cost structure of the company and our confidence in EOG's long-term resiliency. I'm pleased to say we have never cut the dividend and never issued equity to support it. We analyze numerous stress down-cycle scenarios to evaluate the size of the dividend and to ensure it can be sustained over the long run. The regular dividend represents our first priority for returning cash -- free cash flow to shareholders. Beyond that, we have set a target to reduce debt outstanding by $2 billion from the level at the end of last year. We have made a down payment on that goal, paying off with cash on hand a $750 million bond that matured in February 1. There are no additional debt maturities until 2023 when a $1.25 billion bond is scheduled to mature. Beyond that, we have no plans to further reduce debt. Our goal is to maintain about $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet on average through cycles. This is not a hard-and-fast rule. The actual amount of cash on the balance sheet at the end of each quarter will vary depending on business conditions at the time, but this should give you some rough idea of what to expect going forward. EOG is firmly committed to generating significant free cash flow. Our top priorities for free cash flow remain -- is to remain sustainable dividend growth and debt reduction. As cash materializes and we have more visibility into the future, we will opportunistically consider other options, such as a supplemental dividend during the up-cycles or share repurchases during market lows, along with low-cost property additions with potential to improve EOG's performance. Now let me turn the call back to Bill. Bill Thomas : Thanks, Tim. In conclusion, I would like to note the following important takeaways. First, due to market conditions, EOG will not accelerate production in 2021. Second, after this year, once the market rebalances, developing our current drilling inventory at a moderate growth rate of 8% to 10% optimizes returns and free cash flow potential over time. Third, our shift to double-premium investment metrics paves the way for another step-change in EOG's returns and future performance. Fourth, our domestic and international exploration portfolio is stronger in both quality and quantity than it's ever been. This year, we are accelerating the testing and leasing efforts on many of those prospects that have the potential to significantly enhance total shareholder value of the company. Our exploration projects have the potential for higher returns, lower costs and lower decline rates than our current inventory. And finally, we are passionate and excited about the innovation and technology that continues to manifest itself in EOG. It gives us confidence that we will continue to lower well costs and operating costs and reduce our environmental footprint. Our goal for EOG is to be one of the lowest-cost, highest-return and lowest-emissions producers playing a significant role in the long-term future of energy. Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A. Operator : [Operator instructions] And our first question today will come from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Arun Jayaram : Bill, my first one is for you. In 2021, you're gonna hold, call it, a maintenance program. And based on your '22 and '23 outlooks, you could have some growth, call it, 8% to 10%. I guess, my question is, given typical shale cycle times, would you have to spend any incremental capital in 2021 to prepare you to meet that 8% to 10% growth in '22? Bill Thomas : Hi Arun. I'm going to ask Billy to comment on that. Billy Helms : Yeah, Arun, no, we don't anticipate that we would have to spend any additional capital this year to be able to accommodate growth in the future. And beyond this year, I would add that we'll only add activity once we see a more balanced market, as Bill described. Arun Jayaram : Tim, I got one for you. In the guide, we did note a step-change lower in the tax deferral with the company's current tax mix now above 90%. Can you talk about the drivers of the higher cash tax mix in 2021? And as we would have thought some of your IDCs would have led to a lower cash tax rate. And can you just talk about, is this a one-year phenomena or indicative of the go-forward tax rate? Tim Driggers : Arun, this is Tim. Yeah, so as we become more and more profitable, obviously, it has lowered the price that we have to make a taxable income. So that's the first thing. We are an extremely profitable company now. And if you go back and look to the -- to 2020, for sure, in the $39 oil, there wasn't much tax profit there. So in the $50 environment, we have significant taxable income, and we have no net operating losses left to offset that with. So it's a simple math of being a very profitable company and paying taxes. So beyond that, I could clarify it more offline, if you'd like, but that's the general answer. Operator : Your next question will come from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. So sorry, Tim, not to keep pushing you on Arun's question right now. But in terms of '22 and '23 on the deferred tax, how that might trend, is it possible that the deferred guidance might improve a little bit next year as you get back to growth to 8% to 10% because you'll be spending more money? The strip is backward dated, which, I guess, is lower cash, so good news, bad news for this. As well as you've got a lot of gains on the nat gas side for this year that maybe may not material next -- materialize next year. So maybe just furthering on Arun's question, is it possible that 0% to 15% could be something different in '22 and '23 as you get back to growth? Tim Driggers : That's exactly right. As we spend more capital in the growth mode obviously we'll have more IDCs to deduct to lower our cash taxes. So it a backward dated environment where we got lower oil prices then yes, it would lower that deferred ratio. Jeanine Wai : Thank you for the clarification. My second question is just on cash returns. So given the high-class problem of your forecasted free cash flow and you formally set the total debt target to $3.7 billion with no plans to further reduce debt, what's the minimum operating cash balance that you're comfortable? And I guess, it's a backdoor way of asking like does your new formalized debt target, does that imply that you plan on paying out 100% of excess free cash flow in a year after dividend and after whatever you may allocate toward low-cost property acquisitions? Or am I just getting ahead of myself here? Billy Helms : Yeah Jeanine, I'll let Tim talk about the cash need to operate the company. Tim Driggers : So what we have said is that of around $2 billion is the number we feel comfortable with through the cycles. That doesn't mean it's a hard-and-fast rule that we will have $2 billion on the balance sheet. Some quarters, it will be more; some quarters, it will be less, especially during the quarter based on how money comes in and out of the company. So that's the level that we're comfortable with for now. Billy Helms : Yeah. And Jeanine, the second part of the question is, I think it's important to know that our board is very, very committed to returning cash to shareholders. And we -- I think we've demonstrated that certainly, over the last 20 years, a 20% compounded annual increase in the dividend, the last four years, 146% increase. And then, last year, even in a down year, we increased the dividend and sustained it by 30%. So we're very committed to giving cash back. At the same time, we think it's important to be flexible and opportunistic, which means we want to be able to give the cash back in the way that it creates the most return, the most total shareholder return. And so that will be different in different situations. In an up-cycle, it certainly could be we want to continue to work on the regular dividend. That's the primary way we want to give cash back. And so we are gonna continue to work that really, really hard. And then, on top of that, we'll consider other things opportunistically. As the company continues to improve and get better and improve our free cash flow potential, which we think we're gonna be able to do very consistently over time, we'll consider other options. As Tim mentioned, potentially, a supplemental dividend; potentially, in certain situations, stock buybacks. And then, we are always looking at opportunistic low-cost, high-return bolt-on property acquisitions. And we did a number of those last year. Some of those were in our exploration plays. Some of those in -- really in the Delaware Basin, where we're actually drilling bolt-on acquisitions. So we're always looking to improve the drilling potential of the company through those kind of things, too. So we've got a lot of great options. We're very excited about having a lot of free cash flow and continuing to build on that. That's not a problem. That's a great opportunity. And we're just looking for the right way to redistribute that and generate the highest returns for the shareholders. Operator : And our next question will come from Bob Brackett. Please go ahead. Bob Brackett : Hey, good morning. I was comparing the net expected well completions for this year by play versus last year. And am I over-interpreting it? But I see a decrease in the nonfederal areas, call it, the Texas Eagle Ford. I see a rise in the PRB in the Delaware. Is that program predicated on federal lease concerns or desires? Or am I over-interpreting? Bill Thomas : I am going to ask Billy to answer that one. Billy Helms : Bob, no, I would say, we've -- in the past 10 years, a lot of our growth previously came from the Eagle Ford, and that is a more mature play at this point. And going forward, they still have quite a bit of inventory, and a lot of that is still double premium. But we see a lot of the growth coming from the Delaware Basin and the Powder River Basin, as you mentioned. Part of that is that in the last couple of years, even last year, we built out some infrastructure on federal land. And just as a natural progression of our development program, we start moving activity into those areas. That's true both in the Delaware and the Powder River Basin. But that's kind of where we see activity moving. And that will also help in the decline rate that Bill and Ezra we talked about earlier in the call. Operator : Our next question will come from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Scott Gruber : I want to continue on Jeanine's line of questioning. Thinking more about this year, you'll have about $2.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet post bond repayment, and you mentioned retaining $2 billion over the long term. But you also have the '23 maturity, and then you'll generate $1.5 billion of free cash at $50 this year and even more, another $1 billion or so at $60. So just how do you think about use of cash this year, especially if capex is not going to flex? How do you think about building cash for the '23 maturity? Is that above and beyond the $2 billion you mentioned? And how do you balance that against returning cash this year if the strip is right? Tim Driggers : Sure. So we've already committed to spending $1.7 billion of the free cash flow through the payment of the bond that matured and then our regular dividend. So that's the first thing. And then, at the end of each quarter, we will review with the board what our cash position is, and we will look at, sight into the future and see what the condition as an industry look like and make decisions based on where we are at that point in time. So there's no hard-and-fast rule on what that answer will be. It's a long-term outlook, not a short-term outlook. So that's the way we're building this model. Scott Gruber : Is the $2 billion kind of how you're thinking about the right cash balance for this year or does it, this is a little bit higher given the '23 maturity? How does that come into consideration? Tim Driggers : No, the $2 billion is -- two pieces to the $2 billion; one is normal operating conditions and one is a surplus for abnormal operating conditions. So they're both built into that number, and that's the number that Tim Driggers feel comfortable with. So that's how that number was derived. Having lived through a lot of these cycles and knowing the size of our company, I know what I feel comfortable with to not be stressed in a stressful situation on the cash side. So that's how we derive that number. Operator : And our next question will come from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Leo Mariani : Just wanted to delve a little bit into the capex here in 2021. Certainly noticing from the slides that you guys are spending an extra $500 million kind of above maintenance. I wanted to get a sense of how much of that is devoted to some of these new exploration plays that you guys were discussing here. And then, ultimately, it sounds like there's quite a bit of testing happening with the drill bit in '21 versus last year. Do you guys see this year as really having a potential as kind of a breakout year for exploration success for EOG, given the higher spend. Bill Thomas : Yeah, Leo, let me start that, and then I wanna ask Ezra to give some color on it. But the important thing to consider on our exploration program is that we're investing in plays that we believe will make a significant step-change in the performance of the company. And when I talk about that, that's in addition to the double-premium change we are making this year. It's above and beyond that. We're really looking for plays that are really the new technology we see for the future of horizontal drilling for the most part. These are much, much better rock and have the potential to be much better than -- and deliver results like lower decline rates to help us to generate even more free cash flow and higher returns than ever before. So we're investing in very significant potential -- future potential for the company. The breakdown on the half of the $500 million is $300 million in exploration and $100 million in international and $100 million in ESG projects. And I'm gonna let Ezra comment just in general on our exploration efforts and give a little bit more color. Ezra Yacob : Thank you for the question, Leo. So as Bill highlighted, we pulled back in 2020 a little bit on our exploration budget, commensurate with reducing the capital spend across the board. And so we are excited this year to be able to return 2020 levels to kind of a pre-pandemic level or more of a historic balance level for the exploration side. And while I can't promise specifics on timing or anything like that, I can give you a little bit of color on how the process goes. And obviously, we like to capture leasehold, and we prefer not to talk in too great a detail about our exploration plays until we get the leasehold captured. And especially what we think is not only the Tier 1 areas, the sweet spot of these plays, but also in a contiguous position. And then, as you can see from the last few announcements, Dorado, the Powder River Basin and the Wolfcamp M and Third Bone Spring, we like to have a handful of wells tested, not only testing the geologic concepts and the producibility of the play but also just testing the repeatability on it. And so those things are different from each of these plays, each of the rock types, giving us the confidence and the transparency to start talking about those publicly. As Bill said, and you highlighted, we are leasing and testing across multiple plays this year. We're very excited about the potential that they'll dramatically increase the quality of the already-robust inventory that we have. And as we shifted from premium in 2016 to focus on double premium this year, we really think these exploration plays have the potential to deliver another significant step-change for EOG's performance in the future. And we're -- last thing I'd highlight is we are doing this at a time when much of the industry has really pulled back on any new exploration at all. And that leaves us in kind of a countercyclic opportunity here where we are excited that we've been able to put together these prospects and get them drilled and tested and provide a little additional color for you, guys, when we have the information. Leo Mariani : I really appreciate that. Just for my follow-up question, I just wanted to ask a little bit about kind of production cadence here on the oil side in 2021. Obviously, the goal is to kind of keep things roughly flat with the 4Q '20 levels of 442,000. You're kind of, obviously, starting at a lower point in 1Q because of a lot of the storm downtime. Does that imply that we're gonna see a bit of a gradual ramp on those volumes to kind of get to the average as we work our way into midyear and second-half '21 for the U.S. oil volumes? Billy Helms : Sure, Leo, no, the production each quarter will be about the same, targeting around that 440,000 barrels a day, which really was our target here in the first quarter. Obviously, the storm affected basically a one week of production, and that came largely in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford areas. All that production is back on now. And that downtime is gonna result in about a 4% decrease in the first-quarter production. And we've stated we've not -- we are not gonna grow production in an oversupplied market. So basically, once we kind of get this production -- now that the production is back on, we'll maintain this rate at around the 440,000 barrels a day in each of the remaining three quarters. Operator : And our next question will come from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Neal Dingmann : Bill, just a quick or easy question for you, or Tim, just wondering about hedging these days, your thoughts. You did pretty well with it in '20, when you had some on, you took off, realized the gains on that. So I'm just wondering, with the improvement we've seen in oil prices here, although we're in kind of, obviously, steep backwardization, how are you all thinking about that? Bill Thomas : Yeah. Neal, we remain opportunistic on our hedging. Obviously, the price has moved up very dramatically here in the first quarter of the year, faster than really we had thought. We added a few hedges there at the beginning of the year, just to lock in above 50 and 55. But we're currently watching the market and watching it move up, and we'll be opportunistic and add hedges as we feel that they will be beneficial. And we have no hedges in natural gas at this time. Neal Dingmann : Okay. And then, just you guys have been successful on your organic exploration you've talked about. I'm just kind of curious, with the plan this year, as you have -- I guess, my question is, do you have a set plan on sort of regardless what happens to either pricing or the success of these plays throughout this year and into the '22 what you would do activity and sort of spending-wise on that? Is it pretty set? Or is that -- could that still ebb and flow. Bill Thomas : We'll let Ezra talk about this. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Neal, thanks for the question. We have kind of a base plan setup for our exploration, but what I would say is much of it's going to be dependent on what we see -- how we get these leases put together and what we see on the early results of these plays. So we remain fairly flexible on how quickly we think we could start to allocate capital to these. What I would say, just a little more color, is all of our domestic exploration plays, as we've highlighted in the past, are in areas of preexisting oil and gas operations. So they're not frontier basins or anything like that. There is some form of infrastructure, albeit maybe legacy. And so we would be able to get these things kind of produced and up and moving once we have the results on the repeatability of the plays and have the acreage tied up. Operator : And our next question will come from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Singer : My first question is a two-part question with regards to the decline rate impact from the shift to double-premium locations. What characterizes either the underlying geology or what you're doing in your completion techniques to achieve these lower decline rates? Or is it just a shift away from the Eagle Ford? And then, if this represents a new capital-efficient shift for the company, why would it not push down maintenance capital below the $3.4 billion? Billy Helms : Sure, Brian, good morning. So as far as the decline rate shift, that's coming mostly from focusing our areas on better rock, to be honest, that as we mature the Eagle Ford Play, as we mentioned earlier, and more of our capital is going toward the Delaware Basin and even the Powder River Basin, in general, those are plays that had essentially better rock and capability of a lower decline. So that's a large part of that. And then, on the new -- with the shift in the capital efficiency and the maintenance capital, I would remind you, the $3.4 billion, when we set that, I guess, a year or so ago, that was at a production rate of about 420,000 barrels a day. And that was also pre-Dorado. So we are maintaining the $3.4 billion at a higher oil production rate of 440,000 barrels a day, and we've also added in the capital on Dorado because that is part of our announced plays going forward. Brian Singer : Great. Thanks. And my follow-up actually does involve Dorado because you mentioned that a couple of times in your prepared remarks as a potential global energy solution. And I wonder how you monetize that. Is there an LNG contract or partnership with a global player? Or are you taking a more bullish view on medium- or longer-term U.S. natural gas prices? Billy Helms : Brian I am going to ask Lance to talk about the L&G potential for Dorado? Lance Terveen : Hey, Brian, good morning. This is Lance. Yeah, I mean, I think as we've talked about in the past, that's what makes it so exciting about the Dorado play. It's just -- when you think about the proximity to the market, I mean, we're so close to the proximity to both -- all our domestic customers, but then also the LNG markets as well. So I think the biggest thing, again, is just the proximity. It's the location. It all -- it's very complementary with what we've done in the past in a lot of our plays, moving gas downstream to, obviously, try to capture the highest prices. So we'll just continue to stay very opportunistic there, but the big thing I want to focus on is just the proximity and what's in place today. Operator : And our next question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please go ahead. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Good morning, it's Doug Leggate, actually, from Bank of America. I'm afraid that I'm just going to focus on one issue, Bill, and you have to forgive me, it's on the growth plan post 2021. And I want to kind of just set this up a little bit. And then, my question really is why 8%, 10% is the right number and how you define a balanced market? Now I know I've gone through some of this before, but I just want to set it up here a little bit. Basically, just about everybody has dropped their breakeven price. And I think Saudi would argue that their optimal production rate is a lot higher than where it is today. So when you talk about an optimal plan, you talk about a $53 average oil price in the last four years, but we know that Saudi was subsidizing that. So I'm back to the same question I had a number of years ago, which is why when you represent 0.5% of global supply, it's OK to grow at 10% or 5% of global demand because that puts you back to being part of the problem? Hopefully, you see where I'm going with this because if everyone else said the same thing. The U.S. is 500,000 to 1 million barrels a day. And your price war comment, my last comment, I want to just offer a little different perspective on that. Saudi put 2 million barrels of a day on the market in April, put it on a ship and sent it to the U.S. That was a price war. It wasn't a Russia price war. It's an E&P U.S. subsidized growth price war. And so my question for you is, why is 10% OK? How do you define a balanced market? And will you revisit this at some point in the future because it puts us back in the same place you were a few years ago? Billy Helms : Yeah, Doug, yeah, thank you for the question. It's -- first of all, we've been really clear. We're not gonna push oil in an oversupplied market. We're very, very cognizant of the fragile recovery that we're in, and it's important that we don't put any more pressure on that and allow the market to recover. And we are going to watch that the rest of this year. Obviously, we're not gonna -- we've made a commitment. We're not going to be increasing production this year, and we'll watch it next year before we set our plan. So we're not -- we are not interested in growing oil in an oversupplied market, period. And when the market is right and we begin growth again, the reason that 8% to 10% is the right number because it really optimizes all the metrics in the company, returns and free cash flow potential over time. We got a great chart that we put together in Slide No. 10, and it really shows that the operating efficiency, the operating cost, the earnings and cash flow per share growth, the return on capital employed, the three-year cumulative free cash flow and the long-term free cash flow, all are at an optimal level at an 8% to 10% growth rate. If we go slower, some of those are not optimal; they're worse. If we grow faster than that, at the same thing, some of those are not optimal; they're worse. So the 8% to 10% really optimizes a balanced growth rate, a moderate growth rate, where the company can continue to get better very fast and optimize our returns, our earnings potential, our cash flow potential and our long-term free cash flow.. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Maybe as a quick follow-up then, Bill, on the same topic. So I understand the point about optimal, but optimal is because of what the strategy you decide to adopt. So for example, you don't need to spend $0.5 million or $1 billion on exploration. If you do, you could high grade. You never rightsize the company with a slow growth rate. And you still describe taking 5% of global demand as moderate. So I guess, my question is, between 2017 and 2019, Saudi have 2 million barrels a day held up to market before COVID. Is your definition of a balanced market that the lowest cost producer is still subsidizing the business by bringing back any production? Because that, by definition, is subsidizing your business. So optimal -- I'm just having a tough time understanding why you're not learning any lessons from growing nine times in 10 years with very little cumulative free cash flow, and your share price response, obviously, was terrible. So why is 5% global demand growth for a company with 0.5% global supply okay? Billy Helms : Yeah. I think there's two elements that we look at really closely, obviously, to determine whether the market is relatively balanced or not. One of them is the inventories. We want to see them get down to the five-year average or lower and keep hitting lower. Then the other is spare capacity, worldwide spare capacity. So we're watching spare capacity, and as it's -- at the moment, it's still 10 million barrels a day, and we need to have some work. So we want to get spare capacity down in the world to kind of a historic normal level. And so we'll be watching both of those. And we are very definitely committed to not overpressuring the market and working with the market we have to work with and staying disciplined and not trying to push oil or grow oil into an oversupplied market. We're making that commitment. We've always done that. We did it in 2015 and 2016. We didn't grow. We, obviously, shut in production last year, and we're staying -- we're maintaining that exit rate this year. So we're very disciplined and we're very cognizant of that. Beyond that, when the market is available, we want to run a company to generate the highest total return for the shareholder value. That is our job. We want to generate value, business value, really core business value. And that's what we're about, and that's what we're going to stay focused on. Operator : And our next question will come from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead. Charles Meade : I wanted to ask a question about your double-premium inventory and really the rate of change there. If you took that definition of double premium and applied that to your '19 program and your '20 program, what percentage of that '19 program or '20 program would have fit -- would have qualified for that double-premium bucket? And what's it gonna be in '21? Bill Helms : Yeah, Charles, Yeah, the double premium, we've been building more double premium every year as we get our cost down and improve our well productivity. Last year, it was about 50%. In 2019, it was less than that. So last year, it was about 50%. And this year, our goal is to get it up to 75%, maybe even higher percent as that. And then, next year, it will even be higher than that. So we're focused on improving the wells, not only with the cost, but there's a slide, Slide No. 7, I think it is. It shows that these double-premium wells are much, much more productive. In fact, over the first two years, they cumed 39% more oil than the wells we've been drilling in the last several years. So they're better wells. Obviously, we're lowering our costs at the same time. And I think that's really a differentiator for EOG. As the industry data shows, most of the industry well productivity is flattening out. Where at EOG, the well productivity is continuing to increase. So we're not through. We're gonna get better every year. We figure out how to target better rock. Our completion technology continues to increase. Obviously, our well costs are going down significantly. And all that is sustainable. And that's on really the EOG culture and our methodology of not really getting into a maintenance mode and just doing routine every well the same. We are in the learning process. We gather tremendous amount of data and technology. We're learning the geologies. We drill the wells. We're learning the pay quality. And we're figuring out just continuously on a real-time basis how to get better in every aspect of the company. And so we're excited about our future and continuing to increase returns and capital efficiency and free cash flow potential as we go forward. Charles Meade : Thank you, Bill, that's helpful insight into your thinking process. And perhaps, picking up that one thread on better rock, am I interpreting that the right way that -- is that essentially the shift from these -- the resource shale plays more toward these combo-clastic kind of plays? And is that a -- is that just kind of a coincidence? Or is that more of a fundamental arrow for you guys? Bill Helms : Well it's not a coincidence. I am going to let Ezra talk about that. Ezra Yacob : Yeah. Charles, thanks. That's perfect. You kind of hit the nail on the head. As you move away from these, the actual true shale plays themselves are some of the tightest rock. And so as we've moved into not only different basins and different formations but especially targeting the specific landing zones. As we've developed some of our petrophysical, some of our geologic models to really understand the specific landing zones in rocks like the Austin Chalk per se, you fundamentally have higher porosity and permeability, just better all around rock quality that adds to not only the returns but also, as Bill was highlighting, to the shallower decline profile. Operator : And our next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Paul Cheng : Two questions, please. Last year, you signed a gas supply agreement. That seems to be well timed, given the sharp rise in the JKM prices. Can you tell us that what is that volume for this year? And how quickly you would ramp to 440 million cubic feet per day? How many years that we get there? And also that since it's linked to both JKM and Henry Hub, can you tell us that what percent is on JKM and what percent is in Henry Hub? That's the first question. Second question, I think this is probably for Bill. Some of your competitors have decided to formalize the excess cash return framework that once that they have excess free cash after capex and paid dividend, they will pay that out. Just curious that why from EOG standpoint, you don't think that will be a maybe workable program for you because I think the market would love cash return, but that they also love transparency and sort of understanding that under what circumstances they can get what. So just curious that, why that we do not believe that will fit into the EOG model? Thank you. Bill Helms : Yeah Paul, I am going to ask Lance to talk about the JKM. Lance Terveen : Hey, yeah, thanks for your question, especially related to LNG. Yeah, I'd say it was fairly bearish last year, right, related to JKM and just global LNG pricing with the warm weather and, obviously, the oversupply. And things have changed, haven't they, quite drastically to where, on a go forward, it looks very constructive, definitely, as you look at global prices. So yes, just as a reminder there, Paul, we've got 140 million a day that goes into that agreement that we have with Cheniere. Like you said, we're excited for the benefit there that we've seen, especially in a go forward. We kind of had that view going into before and finalizing our agreement. We're definitely constructive kind of long-term related to global prices. And obviously, having exposure to JKM and being very correlated with oil too and having the upside, that's where we kind of wanted to be positioned from an LNG pricing standpoint. So yes, we've been very pleased here in the first quarter with that pricing and constructive from a long-term standpoint as well. And yes, your second question was -- there was just kind of how it ramps up, and you're right. It's the 140 million is the JKM, and there's an additional 300 million that will be tied to Henry Hub. Paul Cheng : And for the JKM, is that the one to one or that is a factor? Bill Thomas : Paul, could you ask that one more time please sir. Paul Cheng : For the link to the JKM, is it a direct price you get the JKM? Or you say factors? Is there an S-curve or anything like that? Bill Thomas : I am not going to go into the specifics contractually, but it's very familiar from what you've heard from Cheniere as well in their IPO model. And so that's how we've structured that. Operator : And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Bill Thomas for any closing remarks. Bill Thomas : 2020 was a year with many challenges, and I'm so very proud of the employees of EOG. They responded with an exceptional performance in an exceptional year. We entered 2021 and this next up-cycle with lower cost and more potential than ever in the history of the company. Our organization and culture are focused on improving returns, playing a significant role in the future of energy and delivering substantial long-term shareholder value. So thanks for listening, and thanks for your support. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and at this time, you may now disconnect your lines.",

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead. Tim Driggers : Good morning, and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing first quarter 2021 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release, and EOG's SEC filings and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions, as well as reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call, or in the accompanying investor presentation slides may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential, not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our earnings release issued yesterday. Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, Chief Operating Officer; Ezra Yacob, President; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor and Public Relations. Here is Bill Thomas. Bill Thomas : Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. EOG is delivering on our free cash flow priorities and our strategy to maximize long-term shareholder value. Yesterday, we declared a $1 per share special dividend to demonstrate our commitment to returning cash to shareholders. Combined with the regular dividend, we expect to return $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends in 2021. Double-premium well productivity and cost reductions are substantially improving our returns and increasing our ability to generate significant free cash flow. In order to maximize long-term shareholder value, we will remain flexible as we carry out our free cash flow priorities in the future. By doubling our reinvestment standard, the future potential of our earnings and cash flow performance are the best they've ever been. This quarter, we generated a quarterly record $1.1 billion of free cash flow and earned $1.62 per share of adjusted net income, the second highest quarterly earnings in company history. In addition, our balance sheet is in superior site with a peer leading low net debt to cap ratio. Next, Ezra will review our capital allocation strategy in more detail. Billy will go over our operational performance, and Tim will cover our financial performance before I make a few closing remarks. And here is Ezra. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Bill. Yesterday, dividend announcement is just the latest in a long line of achievements that demonstrate the value of EOG's fundamental strategy of returns-driven capital allocation, including the impact of permanently raising our investment return hurdle rate for the second time in five years. In 2016, during the last downturn, we established our premium investment strategy, which requires a 30% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. The premium investment strategy drove a step-change in our capital efficiency and resulting financial performance. It is the reason we entered 2020 in a position of operational and financial strength, which enabled us to generate positive adjusted net income and free cash flow in a year of unprecedented oil volatility and prices that averaged just $39. This year, we increased the return hurdle once again, doubling it to 60% at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. Sustainable improvements in our inventory of drilling locations and continued progress in exploration have paved the transition to double-premium. The data driving our confidence to make this move is illustrated on Slide 6 of our investor presentation, which details the return profile of every drilling location. Half our current inventory earns at least two times the premium return hurdle rate we established back in 2016. 5,700 double-premium locations is more than 10 years' worth of inventory at our current pace of drilling and is more than we had when we made the transition of Premium five years ago. Just like we did with our Premium inventory, we are confident we can replace our double-premium locations faster than we drill them through line of sight into additional cost reductions that will increase the returns of existing inventory and through exploration. A number of innovations. which Billy will discuss in a moment, are being piloted across our operating areas, and will sustainably drive down both well costs and operating costs as we implement them throughout the company. Our exploration program is focused exclusively on prospects that will improve on that 60% median return. In fact, our anticipated return on the current slate of new exploration plays is more than 80%. To see the impact of our premium returns focused capital allocation strategy, a closer look at our corporate financial performance is required. As we replace our production base by drilling locations with higher well-level returns, the price required to earn 10% return on capital employed continues to fall. Prior to establishing Premium, EOG required oil prices upwards of $80 to earn a 10% ROCE. As the Premium strategy matured, the oil price needed to earn 10% ROCE came down and averaged just $58 the last four years. This trend is illustrated on Slide 9 of our investor presentation. For 2021 that price is just $50 and we're not stopping there. We expect it will continue to fall as our well-level returns improve. The impact of reinvesting at higher returns is also showing up in our free cash flow performance. We more than doubled the dividend over the last four years and improved our balance sheet, reducing net debt by nearly $3 billion. As a result, net debt to total capital at the end of last year was just 11%, but our future financial performance potential is the real prize. Our first quarter results are a preview of what we are aiming for. Over the coming years, we expect reinvesting in our current inventory of high-return wells will continue to lower the corporate decline rate and compound the value of our low-cost operating structure. The result leads to higher margins and generates even more free cash flow, providing us tremendous opportunity to create long-term shareholder value. We believe when we look back in a few years, it will be viewed as the catalyst for another step change improvement in EOG's financial performance. Our fundamental strategy of returns-driven capital allocation remains consistent, and consistency is key prioritizing reinvestment and high-return projects is the driver behind the steady improvements we've made year after year. As a result, we are now in a position to follow through on our commitment to return additional free cash flow to shareholders. Looking ahead, you can expect our priorities to remain consistent, investing in high returns, generating significant free cash flow to support a sustainable and growing dividend while maintaining a strong balance sheet followed by opportunistic return of additional free cash flow to investors and bolt-on acquisitions. Now here is Billy. Billy Helms : Thanks, Ezra. The first quarter of the year was about execution. We exceeded our oil target producing more than the high end of our guidance range because wells that were offline due to the winter storm, Uri, recovered a bit faster than expected. As a result, our first quarter daily production declined just 3% compared to the fourth quarter last year. Our capital for the quarter came in under our forecasted target by 6%, mainly due to improvements in well cost across the company. The savings realized during the first quarter are in addition to the tremendous 15% reduction last year. EOG is on track to reduce well cost another 5% this year, despite some potential inflationary pressure as the industry activity resumes. Similar to previous quarters, these results are driven through innovation and efficiency gains in each phase of our operation. A closer look at our operations will help explain why we are confident, we can once again lower well cost. Our drilling teams are consistently achieving targeted depths faster with lower cost. The constant focus on daily performance and reliability of the tools and technical procedures is creating this continual drive towards lower cost. Some of the benefits this year stemmed from larger groups of wells per pad simply requiring less rig move cost per well and increasing efficiencies locked offline cementing. The larger well pads also complement our completion operations through the increased ability to utilize the technique we call Super zipper. We began our initial experiments with this technique back in 2019, and it has since advanced to consistently deliver the expected well results at lower cost. We have also learned that super zipper is particularly well suited to optimize the efficiencies of our five electric frac fleets. However, conventional spreads gain efficiencies as well. This practice involves using a single spread of pressure pumping equipment to complete four more wells on a single pad. We split the equipment's capacity in half simultaneously pumping on two wells, while conducting wireline operations on the remaining wells. We piloted and perfected a super zipper logistics in our Eagle Ford play and the collaboration between operating areas has accelerated its adoption throughout the company. And in cases where a minimum of four wells cannot be physically be located on a single pad, the engineering teams are working to develop new techniques where we can still utilize this improved completion practice. Completion costs are also benefiting from reduced sand and water costs through our integrated self-sourcing efforts. The savings we realized by installing water reused pipelines and facilities saves about 7% of well cost compared to third-party sourcing and disposal. Longer-term, we expect water reuse and disposal infrastructure will continue to lower lease operating expense in each area as well. Lease operating expenses also benefited from lessons learned through the pandemic this last year. The number of wells one lease operator can maintain has increased by as much as 80% by optimizing the use of innovative software designed and built by EOG. The software prioritizes lease operator activity throughout the day using our mobile and real-time software infrastructure. Our experienced last year inspired a number of new ideas to further high grade at least operators work activity throughout the day, which we believe may continue to expand productivity in day-to-day field operations. Slide 35 of our investor presentation illustrates the consistent progress we have made year-after-year on productivity all powered by innovative ideas, generated bottom up by employees. Each of our operating - active operating areas functions as an individual incubator to test out new ideas, many of which have our homegrown innovation from EOG employees and rollout companywide, if successful. That's one of the primary reasons, our well cost improvements every year are never won silver bullet, but a list of small to medium-sized individual improvements across all elements of total well costs that results in sustainable cost reduction. As a result of the innovation spreading throughout the company to reduce capital and operating cost, I have strong confidence that the cost structure and capital efficiency of the company will continue to improve. Here's Tim to review our financial position. Tim Driggers : Thanks, Billy. Yesterday's special dividend announcement marks another milestone in the growth of EOG's profitability and cash flow. We achieved this milestone through the disciplined execution of consistent long-term return focused strategy for capital allocation supported by a strong balance sheet. Over time, the strategy has produced increasing amounts of free cash flow. The top priorities for the allocation of that free cash flow remain sustainable dividend growth and debt reduction. The shift to Premium in 2016, drove a significant improvement in returns, profit margins, and cost enabling the significant increase in the dividend over the last four years. Since 2017, the dividend has grown from $0.67 per share to $1.65 per share, now an annual commitment of almost $1 billion. Going forward, our goal is to continue growing the regular dividend. We have never cut or suspended the dividend and we remain committed to its sustainability. With the shift to double-premium we're now focused on making another step-change improvement, and the results of those efforts will guide future common dividend increases, and the potential for special dividends. Since the shift to Premium we have also retired bond maturities totaling about $2 billion, with plans to retire another $1.25 billion in 2023 when the bond matures. Net debt to total capitalization was 8% at the end of the first quarter. A strong balance sheet with low debt has been as the heart of EOG's strategy throughout our existence. It's not just conservatism is about creating a strategic advantage. Our superior balance sheet enables us to acquire high-return assets at marvelous cycle prices where the exploration acreage like the Eagle Ford or for the new players we're working on today bolt-on acquisitions are companies like the Yates acquisition five years ago. A strong balance sheet also gives us the financial strength to be a partner of choice in our operations, whether it is with marketing or export agreements, service providers or even other companies and other countries in locking - unlocking new plays. Strong balance sheet extends to ensuring ample liquidity, which we have also secured with no near-term debt maturities, $3.4 billion of cash on hand and a $2 billion unsecured line of credit. Now, EOG is positioned to address other free cash flow priorities by returning additional cash to shareholders. The $1 per share special dividend follows through on these consistent long-tailed priorities. At $600 million this special dividend is a meaningful amount, while also aligning with our other priorities. After paying the special dividend we will have $2.8 billion of cash on hand, a full $800 million above our minimum cash target. This is a healthy down payment on the $1.25 billion bond maturing in two years. Going forward, our free cash flow priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to monitor the cash position of the company, oil and gas prices and of course our own financial performance. As the excess cash becomes available in the future, we will evaluate further special dividends or at the right time opportunistic share repurchases or low-cost bolt-on property acquisitions. I think it goes without saying you should expect us to avoid expensive corporate M&A. You can count on EOG to continue following our consistent strategy to maximize long-term shareholder value. Now here's Bill to wrap up. Bill Thomas : Thanks, Tim. In conclusion, I would like to note the following important takeaways. First true to the EOG culture our employees have fully embraced doubling our investment hurdle rate. As we drill more double-premium wells, we expect our performance will continue to improve, our decline rate will flatten, our breakeven oil price will decline, our margins will expand and the potential for free cash flow will increase substantially. Second, while our new double-premium hurdle rate alone will drive significant improvement it represents just one source. We never quit coming up with new ways to increase productivity and lower costs. Innovative new ideas and improved technology are developing throughout the company at a rapid pace, and we will continue to result in even higher returns in the future. And finally our special dividend this quarter, we're demonstrating our commitment to generating significant free cash flow and using that free cash to improve total shareholder returns. We are more excited than ever about the future of EOG, and our ability to deliver and maximize long-term shareholder value. Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Scott Gruber : Yes. Good morning. Bill Thomas : Hello, Scott. Scott Gruber : So, the most common question we received, I know you touched on it a bit in the prepared remarks which is the framework that you guys used to determine that the $1 special dividend was the right amount, now is the right time. Can you just elaborate on that a little bit more around the framework and the timing, obviously, folks are trying to get a sense of whether the special dividend can repeat in the future? Bill Thomas : Yes, Scott. Certainly, we're demonstrating our commitment to our shareholders by returning significant amount of cash back to them. And the $1 per share, I think is a very significant number, and large enough to be very meaningful. And I'm going to ask Tim to kind of go through some of the numbers to give you a little bit of the background on the reason that we pick this number. Tim Driggers : Thanks, Bill. So, going back to our priorities over time, it's consistent within our priorities. If you look back to our regular dividend has increased to 146%, since 2017, that's one of our highest priorities. We reduced debt by $2.1 billion. So that set us up to be in a position to now return more cash to the shareholders. When we looked at our cash position, we were sitting with $3.4 billion of cash. So returning $600 million at this point in time, as Bill pointed out, is a significant amount, and it follows through on our long-held plan to return cash to the shareholders. So it simply following through on what we've been committed to for a long time. Bill Thomas : I want to add, Scott. Going forward, our free cash flow priorities and framework haven't changed. And so, you have to put the special dividend in context with our total framework. And just a reminder, we've already said this, but our first priority is a sustainable dividend growth. We believe the regular dividend is absolutely best way to give cash back to shareholders, and we certainly are working on that and have worked, we got a great history of doing that. And then the next one is debt reduction and we've got a little work left to do that as Tim noted in his opening remarks. Our next options are the special dividend and certainly and favorable times what we have right now those are the things that we are doing. And then we'll also - we want to keep in mind the potential for opportunistic share repurchases in downturns, counter cyclic opportunities and share repurchases. And then after that, we also want to be able to consider high return bolt-on acquisitions, and these are acquisitions that go in our best operating areas obviously where we've got a lot of synergy, and a lot of ability to move quickly and drill wells. And some of them could be in our new exploration plays where we can capture a very high potential acreage at very low cost. And so, we'll just continue to evaluate all these options and work with this framework, and we'll evaluate the best use of cash on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We have a dynamic business environment, all the time. So it's important to have the flexibility to use the cash in a way that creates the most shareholder value. Scott Gruber : Got it. And then my follow-up relates to the growth strategy in 2022 and beyond. The oil markets have healed next year and you guys have been very explicit around the factors you're looking at, and you laid out the 8% to 10% growth case on your last call. But there seems to be some discussion around - now around the potential for a middle ground, if you will, maybe some growth case below that 8% to 10%. So I just wanted to hear your latest thoughts around 2022, if the oil markets have healed, and it's time to grow again. What is the right growth cadence? What factors are you looking at to determine that rate of growth if the markets have healed, is there a middle ground somewhere between 0% and 8% to 10%, or is it just if it's time to grow, we're going to grow at 8% to 10%? Bill Thomas : Yes, thanks, Scott, for that question. We want to make sure we're really clear on that. And I think we have, we're not going to grow until demand is recovered to pre-COVID levels and which is it's on the way to do that. I think everybody can see that, and we want to make sure that obviously world inventories U.S. inventories are below the five-year average. And then we're looking for spare capacity to be certainly a lot lower than it is right now. And that just means, not a lot of oil shut into match supply and demand. And every year, the market factors that year going into that year will determine our plans. And so, we want to be flexible, and we want to be able to - and we will modify our growth plans to fit those market conditions. If we need to grow at a lower rate or no growth at all like we are doing this year, whatever that right growth plan is, whatever fits the market conditions that's what we want to do. Above all, everything else we are committed to staying very disciplined and not forcing oil into a market that's not ready. Scott Gruber : Got it. Thank you. Appreciate the color. Operator : The next question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Arun Jayaram : Yes, I guess my first question is kind of to dovetail on the special dividend talk. Bill, this year you've guided to $3.4 billion in free cash flow, $1.5 billion for dividends, another $750 million for debt you've already paid down? So that leave a little bit more than $1.1 billion of free cash flow, and I know you're above your minimal cash target. So I guess the question is, how are you gauging the market for bolt-ons versus potentially if the oil price holds up here in terms of looking at more cash return this year? Bill Thomas : Yes, thanks, Arun. We take the - we evaluate where we are every quarter. I can't give you any specific on anything, but we evaluate where we are every quarter, and we're constantly looking at bolt-on potential and evaluating that. So we want to make sure we leave room to fully consider that something that would make a very significant difference in the future of the company, upgrade our high-quality premium, double-premium inventory, we want to do that. So, we're very fortunate we've got a lot of cash and we've got a lot of \u2013 hopefully, we believe a lot of cash coming. So that's a lot of great opportunities for us to consider additional special dividends, bolt-on acquisitions, et cetera. And we keep in mind, as Tim talked about, we want to keep in mind our debt reduction targets in a year and then and excuse me, in 2023, and also be able to continue to think about growing our regular dividend. So we'll just keep all those in the proper framework and you just need to know that we're committed to doing the right thing at the right time for the shareholders to be able to maximize the total shareholder value. Arun Jayaram : Great and my follow-up, Bill you cited this is being the company's best free cash flow quarter in history. But I wanted to see if you could provide a little bit more detail on how the unique pricing conditions for natural gas given winter storm, Uri some of your leverage to JKM. How that contributed to the free cash flow? How would you call that out? I know there are some incremental costs, but what was the puts and take on the gas price this quarter? Bill Thomas : I'm going to ask Tim to give some details on that. But just before turning it over to Tim, everybody needs to know the special dividend had nothing to do with the storm in the natural gas process. Well Tim, you'll give some detail? Tim Driggers : Sure. When you boil everything down the effects of Uri was about $40 million to cash flow, and net income in the quarter. Obviously, they're a big component in there, but that's the bottom line. It was very immaterial to our cash flow, our net income. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Scott Hanold : Thanks. First and foremost, I want to - I appreciate you're very direct commentary on your desire not to grow, and what the plan is. So hopefully that does clear the air a bit. What I'm wondering is strategically if we do stay in sort of the current environment, whether it's '22, or even beyond you all do build a lot of free cash flow. I mean we're talking what something around $3 billion even after your base dividend annually. Do you all see if there is a benefit into setting up a more predictable return to cash, cash return to shareholders, like some of your other peers did. Do you think there is a benefit to that predictability? Or would you rather see that more opportunistic? Bill Thomas : Yes, Scott. We were always in a very dynamic business environment. So it's important, we believe to have the flexibility to use of cash in a way that creates the most shareholder value. We are - one of the reasons we don't - the biggest reason we don't want to get into a strict formula because we don't want to be put in the position to where we're growing oil say at 5% when the market clearly does not need more oil. So we want to be in a position to where we can do the right thing at the right time and to maximize the use of the cash in our plan to maximize shareholder value. Scott Hanold : Thank you for that. And my next question, maybe this one's for Ezra. You all talked about shifting to double-premium that's generated significant increases to EURs, that Page 8 shows just a massive uptick. Did you all have any color on how much of that is organic versus mix shift? I would assume the shift to relatively more Permian has relative to say, Eagle Ford has buys that upward. But do you have a sense on how much is mix shift versus organic? Ezra Yacob : Yes Scott, thanks for the question. This is Ezra. Yes, definitely in the Permian we have a higher percentage of those 5,700 double-premium locations are located in the Permian, but part of that is simply just because we have so many targets that are capture there in the Delaware Basin. What I would say is we have a fairly wide variety and fairly distributed variety of double-premium wells across our entire portfolio, including the Eagle Ford, the recently announced Austin Chalk, Dorado play, and the Powder River Basin as well. Operator : The next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I apologize. I was just taking off my headset. Bill or Ezra, I wonder if I could press on Scott's point. I'm afraid I'm not quite where Scott isn't thinking this draws a line under the growth story. So my question is real simple. You currently have one of the lowest free cash flow yields in the sector arguably a reflection of your share price, but my point is that everyone has got the capacity to spend more money. What happens to your 10% return at $50 oil, if the whole industry follows, you're leading goes back to a 10% growth rate? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Doug. I want to make it really clear. We're not stuck on 10% growth rate, or 8% growth rate. We are totally focused on making sure we do the right thing at the right time. So we, the oil price does not guide how much we're going to grow. It's the market fundamentals. And so we're really focused on that we've laid out a - I think a strong set of fundamentals that we're focused on and we will adjust our plan each year, which means our growth plan each year to those market fundamentals, and maybe certainly and we - next year that we don't grow at all. We may grow at 4%, 5%. We'll just have to see what the market's fundamental show. Doug Leggate : That's actually great answer, Bill. It's not seven stone is kind of what I was really trying to get to. My follow-up is Ezra very quickly. 10 years of inventory double-premium at the current pace, if you do choose to go back to growth one assumes that 10 years shrink some. So can you talk about the sustainability, and how that hold up plays into again - how you think about that activity level? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. Ezra Yacob : Yes. Doug. That's a good question. Similarly, as we've done over the past few years, we're consistently focused on getting better year-after-year. And so by driving down well costs through sustainable well cost reductions, some of which Billy spoke to in opening remarks, but also through applying technology and innovations to increase the well productivity gains, we're able to convert some of our existing inventory every year into that double-premium metric. In addition of that we have few other avenues. The first, which Bill has touched on is bolt-on acreage acquisition opportunities in areas of preexisting development, but then also our exploration effort. And as I talked about in the opening comments our exploration effort is really focused on, again making another step change to our current inventory. It's focused on adding low decline, high impact plays that really increase the overall return profile of the company. And again, regardless of any growth rate when you're reinvesting in higher return opportunities and adding lower-cost reserves to your company, you're really driving down the cost base to the company year-after-year and that's essentially what translates into our corporate financials and allows us to lower that price required for a double-digit ROCE every year. Operator : The next question comes from Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Neal Dingmann : Guys, my first question is around how you look at your reinvestment rate? I'm just wondering, number one, could you talk about at sort of current strip, how you see the reinvestment, and again let's assume another $5 or so higher, what would that do to that? Bill Thomas : Yes. Neal. Thanks for the question. We're going to ask Billy to comment on that. Billy Helms : Yes. Thanks, Neal. You know for the reinvestment rate, we're always looking at as Bill already mentioned earlier, what's the market look like and what is the need for all in. We're not - certainly not going to grow into a market that need the oil as he pointed out and just trying to make sure re-emphasize that point. And then in going forward each year, we will do the same thing, we always do. We kind of see where the market is, and what the prices are and what are opportunities are to develop our assets, and we balance that against the cash needs of the company. So, it's not really a straight formula, it's more about where the market is at that current time. Neal Dingmann : I'm glad to hear that. I wish more others would say the same. And then just a follow-up. Could you talk about, I would call this question more on sort of your regional allocation process. I know Bill, you talked about sort of the new hurdles, the Premium locations, but I'm just wondering, how does that factor in when you've got some exciting, but not quite as developed areas like in the PRB. But I think it have a high potential, but if you just strictly looking at maybe what they produce immediately might not compete. So I'm just wondering how do you factor in some of those high-potential wells with this plan? Billy Helms : Yes, Neal, this is Billy again. Let me take a stab at that. So as we look at all of our assets, that's the beauty of having a decentralized culture where we are focused on multiple plays across our portfolio. You have plays that are in different phases of their life cycle as you might think about it as you just said it like the Eagle Ford is a more mature play. It's had a growth for about 10 years. It's further down that maturity window than say that the Delaware Basin. And then the Powder River Basin is certainly in early maturing or early growth phase play. So each one of those we certainly go in with the idea of delineating the play first, putting in the infrastructure to drive down our cost over time, and then maximize returns. So each one of those have a different lifecycle that commands a different amount of investment and overall though, the company is able to maintain a very steady pace of activity and future value creation through that the way we operate the company. Operator : The next question is from Leo Mariani of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Leo Mariani : I am spending here. So everything that just based on your guidance, your CapEx is picking up on here in the second quarter. I just wondered what was sort of driving that, I wasn't sure what was time causing up? Billy Helms : Yes, Leo, this is Billy. So the guidance on the CapEx, it's up a little bit in the second quarter relative to the first quarter is simply the timing of when wells are available to be completed. So we'll have a little bit more completion activity in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter. That's simply yes. I think in general will have about 50%, 52% of our CapEx spend in the first half. The remaining to be spent more ratably through the rest of the year and the volumes will be really pretty much keeping with that 440,000 barrels a day, per quarter average the rest of the year. So it's a - we will be maintaining 440,000 barrels a day each quarter going forward. Leo Mariani : Okay, that's helpful for sure. And just wanted to ask on the exploration plays. If I'm not wrong, I think you guys are certainly devoting more capital there particularly to the drill bit in 2021 here. I just wanted to confirm you guys kind of drilling out multiple plays at this point. I think you did a little bit of that in the last couple of years as well. And as a result maybe just can you kind of speak to high level, what your competences, and being able to prove some of these up in the next year? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Leo. This is Ezra. I appreciate the question. Yes, on our exploration plays, you're right, we're - we've allocated about $300 million to the exploration effort this year. Over the last few years, we've done a little bit of drilling, it was dominantly kind of leasing, putting some of the acreage together and then, of course, there was a pullback here in 2020 due to the reduction in capital allocation associated with the downturn in prices and COVID. But this year we are back to drilling multiple prospects. We're at a point where the prospects have started to move at different phases, I would say. We're drilling exploration wells across some of the prospects, across others we're into more of what I'd call appraisal wells, and we're feeling very confident with where we're at, the results that we're seeing, and we hope to be able to provide some results on that soon. Operator : The next question comes from Jeanine Wai of Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeanine Wai : Maybe a question for Ezra, following up on exploration. You're in Oman now, and I believe we saw last month that you paid a nominal amount foreign interest in the Beehive oil prospects offshore Australia. So can you talk about what attracted you to Australia? And do you still have interest in other international plays? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Jeanine. That's a great question. This is Ezra. Yes, the opportunity there in Australia, as you mentioned, it's on the North West Shelf, obviously, everyone knows a very prolific hydrocarbon region. It's a shallow water opportunity that we've stepped into there, as you mentioned for a very low upfront cost. It's exposing us to a prospect that we think has the opportunity, the potential to be impactful to our company. It - we're forecasting it has the potential to really compete with our domestic returns, and what we have - the opportunity that we have here in Australia is really an outgrowth of our experience in Trinidad where for nearly 20 years, we've been operating in the shallow waters offshore of Trinidad, and really this is a geologic province, a type of play where the industry has really moved away from. And so we found ourselves as kind of a niche operator, and we've developed not only operational procedures but also some geologic techniques, where we think we can come into some of these shallow water prospects and make very, very good returns. The attractive thing about Australia again is not only does it fit into our experience level from the operations and technical perspective, but it has many off-take and oilfield service availability there. And of course the low cost of entry to an exciting amount of upside in the prospect. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Interesting, while we looking for - my second question, and I apologize, and for beating the horse again on the - but on the special dividend the first section in the market is simply that net cash returns are consistent of formulaic. You can't capitalize on evaluation, you don't get credit for it, et cetera. With that in mind, you mentioned that you evaluate the health in the business every quarter, probably more frequently than that, and specifically when it comes to the special dividend can you just clarify, is it really a matter of just holding $2 billion minimum operating cash plus $800 million to $1.25 billion for this 2022 maturity? And then everything else kind of get paid out in due time, and it kind of needs to be meaningful. I know you also mentioned a couple of times having optionality for high return bolt-ons is also one of the priorities. So if you have any kind of commentary and a comfortable placeholder for that would be really helpful. Thank you. Bill Thomas : Jeanine, Tim's given I think some answers for some of those on there. Yes, we want to keep ample cash on the balance sheet to run the business and that's around $2 billion. And then we have set aside, are looking at plans to reducing the $1.25 billion bond in 2023. So that's all fits in, and that's part of our evaluation of how we use the cash and when we use the cash. But really the special dividend just fits into the framework that we've already laid out in our commitment to giving back cash to shareholder. So we will look at our cash position, look at a bolt-on potential opportunities. They can truly be any size from a very small, we've done in the past $20 million - $30 million deal, but they could certainly be bigger than that, too. So we'll take all that, and working into our framework and evaluate where the company is, and the outlook for the business, and our goal is to continue to return cash to shareholders through that framework. Operator : Q - Charles Meade : Charles Meade : Yes, good morning Bill to you and your whole team there. I really just have one question, and it goes back to the some of your prepared comments Bill and more specifically share repurchases. Yes, I recognize that hasn't been your MO in the past, and they kind of have a bad reputation maybe because usually share repurchases wind up being pro-cyclical. In the way you talked about it you said for you, you would look at it in an opportunistic ways, the word I remember and you said in a downturn. And I guess my question is, it's easy to see a downturn in retrospect, right. Six months ago, you guys had a three handle on your stock. But it's hard to recognize when you're in it. So is there any guidepost that you can share about how you would recognize when you're in one of those downturns, so it's time to be opportunistic, or is it just one of the things, you know what, when you see it? Bill Thomas : Yes Charles, I think you know, it goes right along with the supply-demand and market fundamentals analysis that we do. We can - we've gotten more sophisticated. We've got a very sophisticated model now developed through our information technology, and we're gaining a lot of confidence in it on being able to kind of be on top of the oil market and where it's headed and certainly the oil price that's the biggest indicator. But we, I think we'll be able to determine when is the right time, when is the opportunistic counter-cyclic time to maybe consider share about buybacks. And of course now we have a lot of cash on the balance sheet and we want to continue to watch that and keep that who will have an opportunity when we do have a downturn to have cash to do that, if that happens. Operator : The next question comes from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Neil Mehta : Good morning, team and congrats on a good quarter here. The first question is Bill any updates on permitting on federal lands? And how that process has been to apply for new permits? And in general in your conversations with Washington does it seem like some of the risks around the federal lands exposure in the Delaware has diminished. Billy Helms : Yes, Neal, this is Billy Helms. So on the permits, the federal permit, certainly we were very active in obtaining permits prior to administration change just to protect our activity levels as since this moratorium has been lifted, we are receiving a steady stream of permits. The permit stream is coming very well. We're receiving permits in all of our areas too. So I think the working relationships we've been able to maintain with the regulators is, and working through the process with them has benefited, if it is real well. So we're not really seeing any restrictions there. And I think the Biden administration clearly as said that activity, he wants to maintain activity on valid leases. So we're very comforted by the fact that we'll be able to continue then. Neil Mehta : And the follow-up is just on the macro. You guys talked a little bit about the tools that you have to evaluate direction of oil price and the way things are trending. Bit curious if you could unpack what you're seeing real-time? And how you're thinking about the commodity price moving from here for both for oil and for natural gas? Billy Helms : Yes. Neil on oil and as we already talked about the fundamentals are definitely improving. It's been a little bouncy on the COVID recovery and oil demand, but we are seeing very, very steady improvements. I think we're up to maybe 95 million barrel a day. Demand right now we think maybe by the end of the year that we'll get to pre-COVID levels of somewhere around 100 million barrels a day. We'll just have to watch it and see. The inventories are dropping. And we think you know there'll be fairly consistent draws on inventory from here on out, especially during the summer pickup activity. And so that's all looking really good. And then the spare capacity you know is going fine. It's been extended in drawing out a little bit further than what it started out to be at the beginning of the year, but we believe again as demand picks up that's spare capacity will be put back online. I'm going to give you the data when everything is okay. We'll just have to watch and see it, but certainly everything is going in the right direction. And I think the market as oil prices have responded to that. I think it's that what we're saying, and seeing it's not different than what the consensus view is. On natural gas, we're mildly bullish. Inventories are low, and supply is less and demand is higher this year than the supply. So we're going to be entering the summer and particularly the fall of the year, and it was pretty low inventories. So depending obviously is always depends on the weather on gas. And so, we'll just have to see how all that turns out, but we're optimistic on gas also. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Scialla of Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Scialla : Yes, good morning, everybody. You highlighted for quite a long time, your ESG sustainability ambitions. Just wanted to see where you stand on the price on carbon, or carbon tax? And do you see any economic opportunities in the energy transition for EOG? Bill Thomas : Yes, Michael I'm going to ask Ken Boedeker to talk on that. Just before he starts so - the carbon tax or issues like that we're going to leave those up to the legislatures and not come out with our opinions on that. We'll work with whatever transpires on that. So, Ken you want to talk about other opportunities? Ken Boedeker : Yes, we really have no interest in lower - in our lower return business that this might lead to, but we've really made excellent progress in reducing our emissions over the last four years, and you can see that with our intensity rates coming down as indicated in the attached slides that we've got on the presentation there. We're focused on reducing our own emissions with projects that have competitive returns before we consider a second phase of applying technology such as carbon capture to reduce our emissions. And we do believe that we can use 1% to 2% of our capital budget every year to make a substantial progress towards our goals of no routine flaring by 2025, and it's been endorsed by the World Bank, and our ambition of Scope one and two net-zero by 2040. Michael Scialla : Okay, thank you. And Bill, you mentioned some of the things you're doing to lower well cost, the larger pads and the Super-Zippers. Some of your competitors have talked about three-mile laterals in the Permian. I think you guys have done some two-mile plus laterals in the Eagle Ford, but do you see a trend toward three-mile laterals, particularly in the Permian or if not, what are the issues that would prevent that? Bill Thomas : Yes, thanks, Michael. So on the three-mile laterals, you're right. We've done several, I'd say between 2.5 and three-mile laterals and multiple plays where it makes sense. And we do own probably more predominantly in the Eagle Ford, and then we've had some in the Bakken and also in the DJ. So, but there are unique circumstances that allow that to happen for us, and they're more driven by geology in that particular area, but also the access issues on the surface. I think just as a general rule, I'm not sure that it always makes sense to go through a three-mile lateral. I think you have to take into account the efficiencies have been able to complete that last mile of lateral economically compared to two-mile lateral those kinds of things and a lot of it does depend on the geology. And we spend a lot of detail time working through the geology and how to best approach every single well location we have. So there are some limitations on where you can do that effectively, and so it's not a broad-brush approach. Operator : The next question comes from Vincent Lovaglio of Mizuho. Please go ahead. Vincent Lovaglio : Thanks for having me on. I wanted to ask on the double-premium locations. You might have touched on it last quarter, but if there is anything unique to the geology across these plays that one's itself to higher productivity, but also the lower decline described in Slide 8? And if so, how that might affect your pursuit of new opportunities that are double-premium? Why you guys are differentiated in that pursuit, and also on the development of those opportunities? Ezra Yacob : Yes Vin, this is Ezra Yacob. That's a great question. And yes, what we're highlighting there in the slide deck. It really comes down to what you touched on with the unique geology. These are the double-premium plays are usually in areas where we've really refined our target down to get - in our existing portfolio down to get rock quality that is higher, better permeability and really the big step change is, as we look forward into the exploration prospects as we've talked about before. We're looking for new plays that historically haven't really been drilled routinely with horizontals. We're looking for a higher quality of rocks that we can apply the horizontal drilling, and completions technology to, and really, it's the higher permeability, higher porosity that lends itself to the shallower declines. And we think that this is not only going to be a step change for our performance as a company going forward. But really potentially those are going to be the new reservoirs the industry eventually is looking at to apply horizontal drilling to in the future. Vincent Lovaglio : Perfect. Thanks. And maybe second, any additional color that you can maybe give on unconventional EOR? Just where it stands in the Eagle Ford right now thoughts on flexibility across other plays? And then maybe how that could improve your environmental footprint going forward? Thanks. Ken Boedeker : Yes, this is Ken. As far as EOR goes in the Eagle Ford right now we've high graded our EOR process, and we have some of our units that are in blow down and other units that were continuing to inject into. EOR is much more challenged in higher gas price environment with our double-premium return. So we are evaluating it for other areas based on that across the company. Operator : The next question comes from Nitin Kumar of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Nitin Kumar : Hi, good morning, gentlemen and first of all congratulations. The market is definitely receiving the special dividend very well. My question is perhaps a little different from some of the other ones that have been asked. Over time, I was looking at Slide 9 you've migrated to this double-premium strategy. With the macro environment is favorable as it is, what happens to the single premium or the lower half of your core inventory here? Ezra mentioned exploration pace is going to have returns as high as 80%. So just wondering, is there an opportunity to with A&D market opening to monetize some of those, or how should we think about that part of your inventory? Bill Thomas : That's excellent question and we appreciate it, and I appreciate your compliments. Yes, we are always evaluating property sales, and I'm going to ask Ken Boedeker to comment on that in general for the company. Ken Boedeker : Sure, thanks, Bill. We're always high grading our portfolio and divesting of those properties with minimal double-premium potential remaining. And we've actually sold about $7 billion in assets over the last 10 years, and we will continue to high grade our assets as we see the market giving them fair value. Bill Thomas : And certainly you know in the last few years, it hasn't been a seller's market, but it is - it will turn as people get short of inventory and we think that the premium, the single premium assets that we have you know, even those are probably some of the best inventory in the industry. So those, certainly have a lot of value. Nitin Kumar : Okay. And they don't - with $60 oil and cost where they are today, they don't compete for capital within your program? Bill Thomas : Yes, that's correct. 30% rate of return at 40% doesn't compete in our program right now. It needs to be 60% rate of return at 40% flat. It's a definitely a huge shift in our returns. And that's what we've been talking about for the last several quarters in our script and in our slides detail a lot of really good information. But certainly, the shift to double-premium is, we believe by far the highest reinvestment standard in the industry, and it is a clear separator for EOG, and it will drive exceptional performance for the company going forward. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Thomas for any closing remarks. Bill Thomas : In closing, our excellent first quarter results are a testament to EOG's ability to generate significant shareholder value. We're proud of all of EOG employees and their outstanding contributions to continuously improve the company. Our excitement about EOG's ability to improve returns and increase value has never been greater. So, thanks for listening, and thanks for your support. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",

And it's time for opening remarks and introduction. I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers, please go ahead, sir. Tim Driggers : Good morning, and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing second quarter 2021 Earnings and Operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements.  The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG 's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions, as well as reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures, can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call or in the accompanying investor presentation slides may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential, not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines.  We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our earnings release issued yesterday.  Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman, and CEO; Billy Helms, Chief Operating Officer; Ezra Yacob, President; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Jeff Leitzell, EVP, Exploration and Production. Lance Terveen, Senior VP Marketing, and David Streit, VP Investor and Public Relations. Here's Bill Thomas. Bill Thomas : Thanks, Tim. And good morning, everyone. EOG is focused on improving returns. Results from the first half of the year are already reflecting the power of EOG shift to our double premium investment standard.  Once again, we posted outstanding results in the second quarter. We delivered adjusted Earnings of a $1.73 per share and nearly 1.1 billion of free cash flow repeating the record level of free cash flow we generated last Quarter.  Our outstanding operational performance included another beat of the high end of our oil production guidance, while capital expenditures and total per-unit operating costs were below expectations.  We're delivering the exceptional well productivity that continues to improve. In addition, even though the industry is in an inflationary environment, EOG continues to demonstrate the Company's unique ability to sustainably lower costs. Our performance clearly proves the power of doubling our reinvestment hurdle rate.  Double premium requires investments to earn a minimum of 60% direct after-tax rate of return using flat commodity prices of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. I'm confident our reinvestment hurdle is one of the most stringent in the industry and a powerful catalyst to drive future outperformance across key financial metrics, including a return on capital employed and free cash flow.  As double-premium improves our potential to generate free cash flow, we remain committed to using that cash to maximize shareholder value. The regular dividends, debt reduction, special dividends, opportunistic buybacks, and small high return bolt-on acquisitions are our priorities.  In the first half of this year, we reduced our long-term debt by 750 million and demonstrated our priority to returning cash, significant cash to shareholders with a commitment of 1.5 billion in regular and special dividends. We also closed on several low-cost, high potential bolt-on acquisitions, and the Delaware basin over the last 12 months.  Year-to-date, we have committed 2.3 billion to debt reduction in dividends, which is slightly more than a 2.1 billion of free cash flow we generated. Looking ahead to the second half of the year and beyond, our free cash flow priorities and framework have not changed. As we generate additional free cash, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders in a meaningful way. We are focused on doing the right thing at the right time in order to maximize shareholder returns.  Over the last 4 years, we made huge progress, reducing our GHG and methane intensity rates, nearly eliminating routine flaring and increasing the use of recycled water in our operations. We're focused on continued progress towards reducing our GHG emissions in line with our targets and ambitions.  This quarter we announced the carbon capture and storage pilot project, which we believe will be our next step forward in the process of reaching our net 0 ambition. Ken will provide more color on this and other emission reduction projects in a few moments.  Driven by EOG's innovative culture, our goal is to be one of the lowest cost, highest return, and lowest emission producers, playing a significant role in the long-term future of energy. Now, here's Ezra to talk more about how our returns continue to improve. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Bill. While we announced our shift to the double premium investment standard at the start of this year the shift has been underway since 2016 when we first established our premium investments standard of 30% minimum direct after-tax rate of return using a conservative price deck of $40 Oil and $2.50 Natural gas for the life of the Well. In the 3 years that followed, our premium drilling program drove 45% increase in earnings per share, a 40% increase in ROCE in an oil price environment, nearly 40% lower compared to the 3-year period prior to premium. This comparative financial performance can be reviewed on Slide 15 of our investor presentation.  In addition, premium enabled this remarkable step-change in our financial performance while reinvesting just 78% of our discretionary cash flow on average, resulting in $4.6 billion of cumulative free cash flow. The impact from doubling our investment hurdle rate from 30% to 60% using the same conservative premium price deck, is now positioning EOG for a similar step-change to our well productivity and costs, boosting returns, Capital efficiency, and cash flow.  Double Premium wells offer shallower production declines and significantly lower finding and development costs resulting in well payouts of approximately 6 months at current strip prices. The increase in capital efficiency resulting from reinvesting in these higher-return projects is increasing our potential to generate significant free cash flow.  This year, we're averaging less than $7 per barrel of oil equivalent finding cost. Adding these lower-cost reserves is continuing to drive down the cost basis of the company, and when combined with EOG's operating cost reductions, is driving higher full-cycle returns.  Looking back over the last 4 quarters, EOG has earned a 12% return on capital employed with oil averaging $52. We are well on our way to earning double-digit ROCE at less than $50 oil, and it begins with disciplined reinvestment, and higher return double premium drilling. While EOG has 11,500 premium locations, approximately 5,700 are double premium wells located across each of our core assets. We're confident we can continue to grow our double premium inventory through organic exploration, improving well costs and well productivity, and small bolt-on acquisitions, just like we did with the premium over the last 5 years.  In the past 12 months, through 8 deals, we have added over 25,000 acres in the Delaware Basin through opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions at an approximate cost of $2500 per acre. These are low-cost opportunities within our core asset positions, which in some cases receive immediate benefit from our existing infrastructure.  Premium and now double premium established a new higher threshold for adding inventory. Exploration and bolt-on acquisitions are focused on improving the quality of the inventory by targeting returns in excess of the 60% after-tax rate of return hurdle.  EOG 's record for adding high-quality, low-cost inventory, predominantly through organic exploration, is why we do not need to pursue expensive large M&A deals. 2021 is turning into an outstanding year for EOG. Our exceptional well-level returns are translating into double-digit corporate returns. And our employees continue to position EOG for long-term shareholder value creation. Here's Billy with an update on our operational performance. Billy Helms : Thanks Ezra. Our operating teams continue to deliver strong results. Once again, we exceeded our oil production target, producing slightly more than the high end of our guidance, driven by strong well results. In addition, capital came in below the low end of our guidance as a result of sustainable well cost reductions. We have already exceeded our targeted 5% well cost reduction in the first half of 2021. We now expect that our average well cost will be more than 7% lower than last year. As a reminder, this is in addition to the 15% well cost savings achieved in 2020.  We continue to see operational improvements outpace the inflationary pressure in the service sector. Average drilling days are down 11%, and the [treated] (ph) lateral completed in a single day increased more than 15%. We are utilizing our recently discussed super-zipper completions on about a third of our well packages this year, and I expect that percentage to increase next year. In addition, our sand costs are flat to slightly down year-to-date.  We have a line of sight to reduce the cost of sand sourcing and processing and expect to start realizing savings in the second half of 2021, and into 2022. Water re-use is another source of significant savings, and we continue to expand and re-use infrastructure throughout our development areas.  Finally, we have renegotiated several of the expiring higher-price contracts for drilling rigs, and expect to see additional savings the remainder of this year and next. We also used the strength of our balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities to reduce future costs in several areas.  As an example, last summer we pre-purchased the tubulars needed for our 2021 drilling program when process were at their lowest point. EOG is not immune to the inflationary pressures we're seeing across our industry.  But this forward-looking approach helps EOG mitigate anticipated cost increases. As a reminder, 65% of our well cost are locked in for the year and the remaining cost, we're actively working down through operational efficiencies. As usual, we have begun to secure services and products ahead of next year's activity with a goal of keeping well cost at least flat in 2022. But as you can rest assured that with our talented and focused operational teams, our ultimate goal is to always push well cost down each year.  The same amount of effort is being placed on reducing our per-unit operating cost with the results showing up in reduced LOE, driven mainly by lower workover expense, reduced water handling expense, and lower maintenance expenses.  Savings are also being realized from our new technology being developed internally to optimize our artificial lift. We have several new tools that help us reduce the amount of gas-lift volumes required to produce wells without reducing the overall production rate. These optimizing tools not only reduce costs, but also help reduce the amount of compression horsepower needed, which ultimately reduces our greenhouse gas footprint as well. These and other continual improvements are great testament to our pleased, but not satisfied, culture.  This quarter, we can also update you on our final ESG performance results from last year. We reduced our greenhouse gas intensity rate 8% in 2020, driven by sustainable reductions to our flaring intensity.  Operational performance in the first half of this year indicates promise for future further improvements to our emission's performance in 2021, putting us comfortably ahead of pace to meet our 2025 intensity targets for GHG and methane, and our goal to eliminate routine flaring. Achieving these targets is the first step on a path towards our ambition of net-zero emissions by 2040. Water infrastructure investments also continue to pay off. Nearly all water used in our Powder River Basin operations last year was sourced from reuse.  For Company-wide operations in the U.S., water supplied by reused sources last year increased to 46%, reducing freshwater to less than 1/5 of the total water used. These achievements and along with the insight into ongoing efforts to improve future performance, will be detailed in our sustainability report to be published in October. We're starting to fill in the pieces on the roadmap to get to net-zero by 2040. Here's Ken with the details. Ken Boedeker : Thanks, Billy. Earlier this year, we announced our net-zero ambition for our scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions by 2040. Our ambition is aggressive, but achievable and we expect it will be an iterative process requiring trial and error. This approach mirrors how we develop an oil and gas asset.  We pilot creative applications of existing and new technologies to determine the most effective solutions to optimize efficiencies by minimizing costs and maximizing recoveries of oil and natural gas. Here, we are aiming to maximize emissions reductions. We then apply the successful technologies and solutions across our operations where feasible.  Our net 0 strategy generally fall -- generally falls into three categories, reduce, capture, or offset. That is, we are focused on directly reducing emissions from our operations, capturing emissions from sources that can be concentrated for storage, and offsetting any remaining emissions.  Reducing emission's intensity from our operations is a direct and immediate path to reducing our carbon footprint. Our approach is to invest with returns in mind and seek achievable and scalable results.  We made excellent progress in the last four years through initiatives to upgrade equipment in the field, invest in pilots using existing and new technologies, and leverage our extensive big data platform to automate and redesign processes to improve emissions efficiencies.  As a result, since 2017, we have reduced our GHG intensity rate to 20%, our methane emissions percentage by 80%, and our flaring intensity rate by more than 50%. We recently obtained permits to expand the successful pilot of our closed-loop Gas Capture Project, which prevents flaring in the event of a downstream interruption.  We designed an automated system that redirects natural Gas back into our infrastructure system and inject the Gas temporarily back into existing Wells. The project requires a modest investment to capture a resource that would have otherwise been flared and stores it for further or for future production and beneficial use.  The result is a double-premium return investment that reduces flaring emissions. Our well-head gas capture rate was 99.6% in 2020 and rollout of additional closed-loop gas capture systems will hope capture more of the remaining 0.4%. Turning to our efforts to capture CO2, we're launching a project that will capture carbon emissions from our operations for long-term storage.  This project is designed to capture and store a concentrated source of EOG's direct CO2 emissions. We believe we can design solutions to generate returns from carbon capturing and storage by leveraging our competitive advantages in geology, facility design and field operations.  Our CCS efforts are directed at emissions from our operations, and we are not currently looking to expand those efforts into another line of business. We will provide updates on our pilot CCS Project as it progresses. EOG is also exploring other innovative solutions for GHG emissions reductions.  Over the past 18 months, we have deployed capital into several fuel substitution projects to power compressors used for natural gas pipeline operations and natural gas artificial lift. Compressors are the largest source of EOG 's stationary combustion emissions. By replacing NGL-rich field gas with lean residue gas.  EOG can reduce the carbon intensity of the fuel, which lowers CO2 emissions and improves engine efficiency. Using lean residue gas also earns a very favorable financial return by recovering the full value of the natural gas liquids versus using those components as fuel.  Another fuel substitution test we conducted recently was blending hydrogen with natural gas. While it is still in the early stages, we are analyzing the test data to evaluate the emissions reductions that would be possible from this blended fuel at an operational and economic scale.  We're very excited about this part of the business, just like cost reductions, well improvements, or exploration success. This is a bottom-up-driven initiative. EOG employees thrive on this type of challenge.  We create innovative solutions and applied technology to solve problems, improve processes, and optimize efficiencies while generating industry-leading returns. The EOG culture has embraced our 2040 net-zero ambition and we are focusing our efforts to minimize our carbon footprint as quickly as possible. Now, here's Bill to wrap up. Bill Thomas : Thanks, Ken. In conclusion, I'd like to note the following important takeaways. First, by doubling our reinvestment standard, the future potential of our earnings and cash flow performance are the best they've ever been.  Results from the first half of this year demonstrate the power of double-premium and the beginning of another step change and performance. Second, EOG is not satisfied. We're committed to getting better. Sustainable Cost reduction and improving well performance are driving returns and free cash flow potential to another level.  At the same time, the same innovative culture that is driving higher returns is also improving our environmental performance Third, our commitment to returning cash to shareholders has not changed. As we have already demonstrated, returning meaningful cash to shareholders remains a priority.  And finally, as Ezra transitions into the CEO role, I could not be more excited about the future of the Company. The quality of our assets, and the quality of this leadership team are the best in Company history, all supported by EOG 's talented employees, and unique culture that continues to fire on all cylinders. The Company is incredibly strong and our ability to get stronger has never been better. The future of EOG is in great hands. Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q& A Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions]. Questions are limited to one questions and one follow-up question.  We will take as many questions as time permits. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Leo Mariani : Hey guys, you obviously -- you highlighted some success on the small bolt-on deals here. And I guess just from my perspective, it seemed like those were very, very economic, just very cheap per acre costs at around 2500 per acre.  It is - a lot of it's just a function of the fact that these are very small deals and in captive to EOG existing acreage and infrastructure, which just gives you the natural ability to buy things without a lot of competition. And I just wanted to get a sense of how repeatable these type of bolt-ons can be for you guys going forward. Bill Thomas : Yes, thanks, Leo. I'm going to ask Ezra to comment on that. Ezra Yacob : Leo, you described that very well. These are smaller deals, as I highlighted. It's 25,000 acres across 8 different deals that we've captured and put together over the past 12 months. And these are low-cost opportunities in our core positions within the Delaware Basin.  And typically, these are things that are either contiguous with our pre-existing acreage position or very, very close to our acreage position. And so there's not a lot of outside competition. A lot of times, by all regards, we're the partner that makes sense to go ahead and get these deals because like I said, we have the surrounding wells information, seismic, and oftentimes some of these deals can go immediately right into our existing infrastructure. We highlighted the last 12 months but we wanted to give a sense of the type of scale and the impact that these low-cost opportunities can have when we're focused on them. And these deals are pretty continuous throughout all of our plays and throughout the year. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. And I guess I also wanted to ask about your comment around seeing a less than $7 per BOE F&D year-to-date. Clearly, you attributed some of the factors there where you talked about how your well costs are coming down as part of it, and also the move to double-premium. But maybe you can provide just a little bit more color, I mean, I guess that less than $7 seems like a very low number out there. Are there any other just key factors where maybe there's more of a mix shift to certain plays where perhaps your higher concentration of certain zones in the Delaware this year, and I know you guys are also drilling some gas wells in South Texas that might be helping, just any color around some of the key drivers for getting it to under 7? Bill Thomas : Hi Leo, Billy Helms will comment on that. Billy Helms : Yeah. Good morning, Leo. It's strictly a function of moving to our double premium strategy. We saw a similar change if you remember back when we shifted to premium a few years ago and we're seeing that same compounding effect as we shift to double premium. The quality of our wells improves.  And as you noted, we have a history of continuing to focus on lowering well cost and just our continued effort in those areas. So it's not really attributable to one basin or the other, it's just a function of the impact of shifting to double-premium across our portfolio.  And I might add, as we look to add wells to the inventory of double-premium wells, [they will all be] (ph) in that same category to compete on both returns and finding costs. Leo Mariani : Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question is from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities, please go ahead. Neal Dingmann : Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. My first question is really just around when you talked about shareholder return, obviously that seem to be the hot topic these days. Billy, I'm glad you don't do this, but my thoughts about if you guys would ever -- there's been others out there that have guaranteed a type of return, or amount, or something like that you guys seemed to want to stay more flexible, but I would just love to hear more color on obviously, you guys have [Indiscernible] amount of free cash flow coming in, that's not the issue, I'm just wondering how you think about if you put any sort of guarantees on the type or amount going forward. Bill Thomas : Yeah, Neal. We've outlined a very clear framework and we've consistently delivered on our priorities. And so maybe the best way to think about the future is to look at what we've done in the past. And I want to ask Ezra to give more color on that. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Neal. In our investor presentation there on slide 5 & 6, I think we can reference that. This year we've been very successful executing on all of our cash flow priorities in the framework that we've laid out.  We've been able to increase the regular dividend by 10%, which we feel is our primary motive of capital return. Secondly, we're able to reduce our debt earlier this year by $750 million by retiring a bond. And then third, we just paid a $600 million special dividend on July 30th of this year, which we had announced during the last earnings call. So our year-to-date free cash flow commitment is $2.3 billion, which is slightly more than the 2.1 billion we generated. And going forward, our framework and priorities have not changed.  Lastly, we also highlighted in the opening remarks, as we just spoke about a little bit with Leo, some of the small bolt-on acquisitions we've done, which is one of the avenues to growing our inventory, and that's really the -- where the entire process begins, is having the depth in quality of inventory to continually improve the business.  And with our shift to drilling these double-premium wells, the free cash flow potential, the Company continues to expand and as it does, and as we realize the cash, we're well-positioned to continue executing on our priorities. We're committed to creating the most shareholder value and our cash return strategy is really a reflection of that. So, as the Company continues to improve, we're excited about that potential. Neal Dingmann : Agree, guys. I really like the cash return strategy and then just one follow-up. Exploration, your opportunities is a really -- you guys continue to stick out there. You obviously continue to be the leaders. Mentioned a number of things that have you excited. Could you just remind us again, I think the last was it, I forget Bill, was it maybe 13 or 15?  Was it unique projects here in the U.S.? Could you tell us maybe or just talk about the upside potential you see for that business this year, going into 2022 for the exploration upside. Bill Thomas : Neal I think what we've outlined is we've got about 15 exploration wells built into the CapEx this year in the U.S. So I am going to ask Ezra to give us some more color on that. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Neal. The exploration prospects are all moving forward. As we discussed on the last call, the prospect have all started to move at different phases, really as a result of some of the slow down during COVID and during 2020.  As Bill just mentioned, we're planning on drilling 15 wells outside of the publicly discussed assets. Some of these, in some of the prospects, our initial exploration wells. Some of them are more what we'd call appraisal wells, evaluating the repeatability of these plays.  We're still leasing across many of the plays as well. And as we've discussed, the opportunities are really targeting a higher quality rock and what's typically been drilled horizontally That's an outgrowth of a lot of technical work we've done across multiple basins to combine modern drilling and completions technologies, and apply those to reservoirs that have been traditionally overlooked.  And really, we're very happy with our progress to date and we look forward to sharing additional information at an appropriate time. Neal Dingmann : Great details. Thank you, all. Operator : The next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate : Thank you, guys. I think this is the first time I've had a chance to see Bill. Congratulations on your retirement. And Ezra, excited to see what you -- how you move forward with the business. But I wonder, Bill if I could ask you just to maybe a little bit of a retrospective here as you walk out the door, so to speak. There has been a lot of changes in the business model, growth transitioning to free cash flow, and so on. So I'm just wondering if you can offer any thoughts as to how this business should look going forward, both at the sector level and that EOG level. As you look back on your tenure and the changes that have taken place [Indiscernible]. Bill Thomas : Yeah, Doug. Well, thank you very much. And you're right. I mean, the business has evolved over the last year since the shale business really started. And it's obviously it's moving in an incredibly great positive direction right now that the focus on returns, that we've always been I think a leader in focus on returns and we're super excited about that.  The capital discipline, spending well below cash flow and generating high returns, and giving a significant amount of cash back to shareholders, I think is certainly all very positive. And so I think really we're entering a super new era.  And I think it's more positive than it's ever been before. I think we, as an industry, are going to generate better returns and going to give more back to the shareholders. And I think we're in a more positive macro-environment than we've been in since really the shale business started. I think OPEC + is solid. I think the U.S. will remain disciplined. And so I think the industry is in for a long run of really good results. Doug Leggate : We've been bumping heads with you over the years, Bill, so congratulations again, and good luck. Ezra, my follow-up is maybe for you. EOG has obviously been an organic story for many, many years and you've touched on exploration again today, but Yates was one of the, I guess, the step-out acquisitions that you did and if you look at your portfolio position today. There's clearly a large asset potentially for sale right in your backyard and a very high-quality acreage position you could argue, why would M&A not be a feature of the business at some point, and maybe I go so far as to say would you rule yourself out of being interested in that shell package. Thank you. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Doug. No, we're not evaluating any large acquisition packages at this time. We're focused on these small high-return bolt-on acquisitions. And as discussed in opening remarks, the larger expense of M&A deals, the opportunity struggled to compete with the existing return profile that we have within the Company due to either high PDP costs, the high acreage costs, or both.  Oftentimes the acreage being marketed might be additive to the quantity of our inventory, but not additive to the quality. And as we've discussed we're always working to improve the quality of our assets.  We're having great success with the small bolt-on acquisitions. We're feeling very confident with our ability to increase the quality of our deep inventory through our organic exploration program. And so we're excited about our prospects there. Doug Leggate : Very clear. Thanks, Ezra. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank please go ahead. Paul Cheng : All right. Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Two questions, please. First one, maybe that's -- Bill you can help us to frame it to understand that decision than maybe better.  If we look at last Quarter when you announced the specialty that they're making you set a number of key conditions and that's all being met such as in January, substantial free cash flow, you don't have much of the debt maturity in the near-term, and your cash is already in excess of what you think is a reasonable level which is to finite.  If we look in this Quarter, basically all those conditions are still being met. But do you decide not to pay the special dividend? So, we're just trying to understand that what is the additional consideration in that decision. And also, if you can talk about between buyback and special dividend at this point of the cycle, which is more peak variable for you or how you look at the differences? So, that's the first question.  The second question, yes, relate to, I think that you guys question many of the basins, you are not interested in large-scale M&A which is understandable. But it makes sense, however, that to work with some of your peers to pull together the asset to form a really large joint venture.  So everyone still has their own equity ownership. You don't pay any premium, but you will be able to allow to use your technical know-how to apply to even a larger scale asset and drive even better efficiency gains. Do you think that it makes sense for EOG for that kind of structure? Thank you. Ezra Yacob : Yeah, Paul. On the first question, I think it's super important and I think we've already shared this. Our -- we've got a very clear framework and we've consistently delivered, as you pointed out on that framework, and significantly given a lot of money back to shareholders.  And going forward, our framework and priorities are not changed at all. So, as we generate additional free cash flow, we're committed to returning cash to shareholders in a very meaningful way.  It's really all about doing the right thing at the right time. As the Company continues to improve, we're excited about our potential to increase total shareholder return. And in the framework, we do have the option for opportunistic buybacks as long as -- along with special dividends, and so we look at opportunistic buybacks as Bill Thomas : being able to have the opportunity to consider buying back shares and counter-cyclic environments where the market is not well and our sought process is significantly undervalued. Well, that would be an opportunity to consider buybacks. In good times we think the special dividend is the way to go and that's what we're executing on now, and that's what we're hoping to continue to execute in the future. On the second part of your question, on the large-scale M&A, I'm going to ask Billy to think through that question and give his ceiling from that. Thanks, Bill. On the large-scale M&A, as Ezra just talked about a minute ago, certainly we're not interested in adding quantity to our inventory, but it's more about the quality of the assets we have. And as we think about forming maybe a potential larger JV, that same approach needs to apply. As we look across the fence, if our assets are in, what we consider the core acreage position in the play, adding in acreage outside of that ring-fence would dilute our efforts. We've also taken, as you know -- taken a lot of efforts to build out infrastructure to make our -- to lower our unit cost and continue to improve our returns, and we build out that infrastructure to meet the volume expectations that we have for developing our acreage.  That may or may not apply as you add in additional acreage outside of that. I think each Operator looks at how to make the most efficient use of the acreage and their capital as they can, and forming JVs doesn't necessarily improve overall Company metrics.  So I think while we've looked at bolt-on as a way to shore up a lot of our core area acreage, I think that is a very applicable part of maybe thinking about JV expansions. Continuing to come up in your base areas where it adds the same quality, doesn't dilute your quality of the assets, but just expanding in a basin may or may not do that. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Arun Jayaram : Yeah. Good morning. Tim, maybe starting with you. I just wanted to get maybe some of the order of operations around a potential incremental cash return beyond the dividend. Last quarter, you mentioned that EOG likes to keep a $2 billion minimum cash balance plus fund, the $1.25 billion bond maturity. So that suggests that you'd like to get to 3.25 billion of cash and anything beyond that is available for cash return beyond the dividend? Tim Driggers : Certainly, you can do that math, but it's more than that with us. As Ezra and Bill talked about further, we have to look at all of our priorities and the timing of those priorities to determine when and if there is another special dividend, or share repurchases, or bolt-on acquisitions. All those things are in play at all times.  And the 2 billion is not the end of the month number, it's during the cycles, so cash can vary tremendously during a month. The 2 billion is the low point during the month, it's not necessarily the end of a month. So you have to keep that in mind as well but yes, you can do that math. But that's not all there is to it.  We have to look at all of our priorities and where we're at in the cycle. And as it has been pointed out on Slide 6, we've already distributed more cash than we brought in, in the first half of the year. So we're well on our way to achieving that. As we move through the second half of the year, we'll look at what other cash is generated and we'll evaluate how to use that cash at that time. Arun Jayaram : Great. And maybe just a follow-up to Paul's question. Could you give us maybe some feedback you've gotten from some of the shareholders on the special dividend and your thoughts on the pros and cons of moving to a formulaic type of approach around cash return and even especially in terms of buyback? Bill Thomas : Yeah, Arun. This is Bill. We've gotten enormously positive responses from every shareholder on the special dividend and that was a super hit. And they like our framework, when you really think through it, it's not really a complicated framework.  It's a framework where we want to be in a position to maximize total shareholder returns. And as I've said, be able to do the right thing at the right time. If you look at the history of what we've been doing really over the last several years, we've increased the regular dividend by 146%, and now we're working on special dividends.  As we go forward, it is certainly our goal to continue to return meaningful cash back to the shareholders through the process. So, really, it's a pretty straightforward process if you think through it and the framework is pretty simple. And it's just a matter of giving us the ability to have the options to do the right thing to maximize total shareholder return. Arun Jayaram : Great. Bill, thanks a lot. Operator : The next question is from Michael Scialla, with Stifel, please go ahead. Michael Scialla : Hey, good morning, everybody and Bill, I'd like to offer my congratulations on a great career as well. I know it's too early to give details on 2022, but want to see if you could speak to at least at a high level given your outlook for flat to lower well costs next year. If you still see barrels held off the market by OPEC +, would you just look to hold production flattish, and could you do that with equal to lower capital than you spent this year. Bill Thomas : Well, thank you very much again we appreciate your comments. It's a team effort in EOG. I'd tell you what, we've got a lot of great employees and a super management team. It's a team effort and it's been an honor to be able to work with everybody.  About 2022, it's really too early to talk about growth. We need to watch the pace of demand and recovery on the spare capacity drawn down. So we don't want to really speculate on anything specific for 2022, but I want to ask Ezra to make some additional color on that. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Michael. As Bill said, it's pretty early on 2022. It's still pretty early to discuss any type of growth. EOG is -- we're committed. We're not going to grow until the market clearly needs the barrels, and we've outlined what we're looking for. We're committed to staying disciplined.  And currently, we want to see demand return to pre-COVID levels, low spare capacity, and we want to see inventory data below the five-year average. Every year, market factors are going to determine the plan for that year.  And we're going to remain flexible and modify our plans to fit the market conditions. That be said, we have made great progress this year on our total well cost reduction. And going forward, that's strengthening the underlying capital efficiency of the Company and continuing to lower the cost base of the Company.  And so as we move forward, regardless of any type of growth rates, we've set the Company up with this double-premium investment plan to continue to expand the free cash flow generation potential of EOG. Michael Scialla : Okay. And I guess, really just my question there was, if you were to hold the production flat, it looks like the capital required to do that is not going up, at least over the next 12 to 18 months as you see the world now, is that fair to say? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Mike. That's certainly fair to say. I mean, we're reducing costs all the time and improving well productivity. So, we're hopeful that our maintenance costs in the future will be lower than it is today. And that's certainly directionally what we've done in the past, and that's hopefully what we're going to do in the future. Michael Scialla : Okay, great. And then I just want to follow up with Ken on a -- you mentioned the CCS pilot you have there. Is there any more detail you can offer Ken in terms of -- it sounds like it's EOG specific, at least at this point?  Can you talk about what the source of emissions are? Where you're focused within your footprint. And are you looking at storing CO2 in depleted fields or tilling out partners just any more detail you can give us there? Ken Boedeker : Sure. Thanks for that question. At this point in time, we really don't anticipate any partners on our pilot project, but with our geologic and operational expertise, we'll evaluate partnering on future projects on a case-by-case basis.  This project is really part of our broader strategy of reduced capture and offset. And it's focused on capturing our CO2 emissions in an area where we can generate a return via some tax incentives, and have a concentrated stream of CO2 that can be aggregated to an injection well for permanent and secured geologic storage, in an interval of thousands of feet below the surface. And that's pretty much what we're giving out at this time. Michael Scialla : Very good. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from [Indiscernible] Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst 2 : Good morning. To put you on the spot a little bit. You highlighted the various well cost categories, tubular sticks out as being both significant and also exposed to inflation. You tackled the problem last year with pre-purchasing. Can you throw out some ideas that the organization has come up with to attack that cost category? Ezra Yacob : Billy, do you want to comment on that? Billy Helms : Yeah, good morning, Bob. Obviously, yes, steel costs are going up, which is affecting tubular costs. This last year, we were very fortunate to take advantage of pre-purchasing the tubular we needed for this year's program and benefited greatly from that.  As costs go up in the future, we use the same approach and try to take an opportunistic look at when to secure tubular for the next coming drilling program. And so, we'll continue to look at that. Undoubtedly, it's likely that the costs for tubular will be higher next year than they are this year, which is why in that slide number 10, we tried to give you some color. On other ways, we're trying to keep our well cost flat to down going into next year and those come from the efficiencies we're seeing across the operation from drilling times to the implementation of our Super-Zippers technology on the completion side to newer contracts at lower rates for some of the services we have. So it's a mixture of things we use to offset those inflationary pressures that we see in the different parts of our business. Unidentified Analyst 2 : Okay, that's clear. And just as a quick follow-up, could you contrast Super-Zippers the way you think about them versus say, a traditional zipper frac that we might think of where even a dual frac? Billy Helms : Sure. So our Super-Zipper technique is very similar to what the industry calls [Indiscernible]. The differences would be in how we actually implement it on a well-to-well basis. We keep very close control over the injection rates and pressures of individual wells within the Super-Zipper operation.  So it's a very scripted and very detailed procedure that allows us to control the rates and pressures, just like we're doing a conventional frac with any other fleet. But the advantage is of course being able to double the amount of stages you get in a particular day by attacking the locations two at a time.  And we really are advancing that technology quite a bit. Last year, we probably did less than 10% of our wells, across the Company benefited from Super-Zipper, this year, it's probably directionally closer to a third of the wells. And we expect that percentage to increase going into next year. We think it's going to give us tremendous cost advantages next year as we go into the program. Unidentified Analyst 2 : Great, thanks for that. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets, please go ahead. Scott Hanold : Thanks. And Bill again. I also want to give you congratulations on your tenure. Obviously, you all navigated a lot of ups and downs over the past few years fairly successfully. So congrats for that. I just have one question, and you all seem to be doing better than expected. I mean, certainly, it seems like production, especially oil production on the upper end of your range. And can you just give us some general thoughts, I know you're not in a position where you're going to talk to 2022 and how you think about growth?  If you are running a little bit ahead based on the outperformance of your wells, would you think about tapering as you get into 2022 a little bit just to maintain the flattish kind of production you all expected this year? Ezra Yacob : Yeah, Scott, again, thank you so much for your comments. I'm going to ask Billy to comment on the remainder of this year and particularly the Fourth Quarter. Billy Helms : Yeah. Good morning, Scott. So, certainly, we're very pleased with the progress we've made on both reducing our well cost and the performance we're seeing from the wells we are bringing to production this year.  It's a testament to the strategy of shifting to the double-premium standard again. So, as you go into the rest of the year, we started out the year with a little bit higher activity level, we had a little bit higher rig count start of the year and this tapered off and we're running at a pretty consistent rate now and expect that to continue through the end of the year.  And then next year as Bill elaborated, it's hard to anticipate what we'll need this year, but I think the performance that we're seeing this year will continue into next year, certainly. And the pace of activity will be dictated by what we see in the market conditions. So that's the color I could give you. But our performance will continue to at least stay flat or improve. Scott Hanold : Understood. Thank you for that. Operator : The next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs and Company. Neil Mehta : Good morning, team. And congratulations, Ezra. Congratulations, Bill. Bill, last Quarter, you talked a little bit about the analytics that you are building around monitoring the oil macro. I would love your latest real-time thoughts, a lot of moving pieces here. OPEC, demand uncertainty, barrels, U.S. supply, how are each of these parameters evolving here as you guys are evaluating them? Bill Thomas : Yeah, Neil, as we've all seen, where definitely demand is on a strong recovery, it's a bit lumpy, obviously due to the virus resurgent in a few areas, but we expect -- even with that, we expect pre-COVID demand to be reached by early '22. Inventories are already below the 5-year average, really in the U.S. and in the world. So that has already been checked. And on the supply side, as I said before, we believe that the U.S. will stay disciplined and that there'll be small growth in the U.S. next year, but not much growth.  And we've seen OPEC +, they look to be very solid. So they will continue to bring back on their shut-in volumes since fair capacity as needed gradually. If the recovery continues, like we expect, we see the spare capacity to be very low by the Second Quarter or by the middle of next year. We'll just have to watch and see how it goes but overall, we see a very positive macro-environment. Neil Mehta : The follow-up is just, as you think about the U.S. production profile, maybe you can get a little bit more granular in terms of how you're thinking about those volumes. But the question we continue to get asked is, where are we in terms of resource maturity?  Has the best of efficiencies been driven out of the shales? And maybe you talk about the Permian, the Eagle Ford, and the Bakken. What are you seeing in each of those plays? Where are we in terms of efficiencies? And then is the slowdown in U.S. production being driven by resource maturity or is it really being driven by capital discipline? Bill Thomas : Yeah. We see we run the numbers on all the different groups from the privates to the publics to the majors, and in general, particularly in the private, we see definitely well productivity is going down, not up.  So, it takes a lot more wells for that group to maintain production or even think about growing it. And overall, in the other groups, not specifically EOG, but we generally see well productive -- well production to be flat to not improving over time.  And then -- so I think that is a function of resource maturity. I think when you get in down-spacing, and spacing, and in timing and all that, I think it's going to subdue that the productivity.  And so literally, in the biggest factor, of course, is in the capital discipline where you're spending tremendous amount of less cash flow than we've been spending in the previous year. So when you put all that together, we did not see and we think that discipline will remain with a route. We not -- we did not see the U.S. growing significantly next year. So that's a very positive, I think, for shareholders and positive for the macro. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Bill. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Thomas for any closing remarks. Bill Thomas : In closing, I'd like to say thank you to all the EOG employees who continue to make EOG so successful. It's truly a privilege and an honor to be on the same team with each one of you. As Ezra transitions into the CEO role and Billy steps up to President and Chief Operating Officer, along with the rest of the senior management team, I could not be more excited about the future of the Company. So to all shareholders and future shareholders, we want to tell you thanks for listening and certainly thank you very much for your support. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir. Tim Driggers : Good morning and thanks for joining us. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release in EOG's SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures can be found on EOG's website. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chief Executive Officer, Billy Helms, President and Chief Operating Officer, [Indiscernible] EVP Exploration and Production. [Indiscernible], EVP Exploration and Production. [Indiscernible], Senior VP Marketing, and [Indiscernible], VP Investor and Public Relations. Here's Ezra Yacob. Ezra Yacob : Thank you, Tim. Good morning, everyone. EOG is delivering on our free cash flow priorities. Yesterday, we announced an 82% increase to our regular dividend to an annual rate of $3 per share, a $2 per share special dividend, and an update to our share buyback authorization to $5 billion. These cash return announcements reflect EOG's consistent outstanding performance and are the direct result of our disciplined approach to high return investment. During the third quarter, we set new quarterly earnings in cash flow records, adjusted Net Income of $1.3 billion or $2.16 per share and free cash flow of $1.4 billion. The strength of our current and future earnings in cash flow that supports both dividend announcements can be traced back to 2016. Amid a potentially prolonged low commodity price environment, we made a permanent upgrade to our investment criteria.  Our premium hurdle rate was established, not only to protect the Company's profitability in 2016, but all future commodity cycles. The discipline to only invest in new wells that earn a minimum 30% direct after-tax rate of return, assuming a $40 oil price for the life of the well continues to improve our capital efficiency, profitability, and cash flow. Our employees immediately embraced the challenge of this new investment hurdle. And by the second half of 2016, EOG was reinvesting capital and paying the dividend within cash flow. We've generated free cash flow every year since. From 2017 to 2019, we generated enough free cash flow to significantly reduce net debt by $2.2 billion, while also increasing the dividend rate 72%. We also expanded our inventory of premium wells by more than 3 times.  While adding inventory that meets the minimum premium threshold increases quantity, our goal through technical innovation and organic exploration is to add higher quality inventory. Our employees empowered by EOG 's unique culture, applied innovation and efficiencies to raise the return of much of the existing inventory, while adding higher rate of return wells through exploration. The premium standard established in 2016, and the momentum that followed provided a step change in operational and by extension, financial performance, which set the stage for the second upgrade to our reinvestment hurdle rate, Double premium. Double premium, which is a minimum return hurdle of 60% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil was initiated during the depth of last year's unprecedented down-cycle. That capital discipline enabled EOG to deliver extraordinary results in a $39 oil price environment last year. Using such stringent hurdle rates prepared the Company, not only for 2020, but for our stellar results this year. There is no clear indication of the impact premium, and now double premium has had on our confidence in EOG's future profitability than the 82% increase to our regular dividend announced yesterday. Combined with the 10% increase made in February of this year, we have doubled our annual dividend rate from a $1.50 per share to $3 per share. After weathering 2 downturns during which we did not cut nor dispend the dividend -- suspend the dividend, the new annual rate of $3 per share reflects the significant improvement in the EOG's capital efficiency since the transition to premium drilling. Going forward, we are confident the double premium will continue to improve the financial performance just like premium did, 5 years ago. We're also confident in our ability to continue adding to our double premium inventory without any need for expensive M&A by improving our existing assets and adding new players from our deep pipeline of organic exploration prospects, Developing high return, low cost reserves that meet our stringent double-premium hurdle rate expands our future free cash flow potential and supports EOG's commitment to sustainably growing our regular dividend. EOG's focus on returns, disciplined growth, strong free cash flow generation, and sustainability remain constant. Just as our free cash flow priorities are consistent, so remains our broader strategy and culture. EOG's competitive advantage is our people.  And today's announcements are a reflection of our culture of innovation and execution. Looking towards 2022, oil market supply and demand fundamentals are improving, but remain dynamic. While it's unlikely the market will be fully balanced by the end of 2021, we will continue to monitor macro fundamentals as we plan for next year. We are committed to maintaining production until the oil market needs additional barrels. Under any scenario, we remain focused on driving sustainable efficiency improvements. We are well positioned to offset inflationary price pressures to help keep our well costs flat next year. To summarize this quarter's earnings release and 3 points. First, our fundamental strategy of investing in high return projects consistently executed year-after-year is delivering outstanding financial results.  Second, we're still getting better. As we continue to expand our opportunity set to add double-premium inventory through sustainable well cost reductions in our organic exploration, EOG is set up to improve performance even further. And third, we are well-positioned to execute our high return reinvestment program in 2022 to deliver another year of outstanding returns. Here's Tim to review our capital allocation strategy and our free cash flow priorities. Tim Driggers : Thanks, Ezra. As we have been progressing premium the last 5 years, our capital allocation decisions have been guided by a set of long-standing consistent priorities. First, is high return disciplined reinvestment. Our returns on capital investment have never been higher. Our market fundamentals remain the number 1 determinant of when to grow. Second is a regular dividend, which we believe is the best way to return cash to shareholders. We paid a dividend for 22 years without suspending or cutting it. At the new level of $3 per year, we can comfortably form both the dividend and maintenance CapEx at $40 WTI. The combination of our low-cost structure, high returns, and strong financial position will sustain this higher regular dividend. This resilient financial position is backstopped by our third priority, a pristine Balance Sheet with almost 0 net debt. We remain firmly committed to a strong Balance Sheet. It's not conservatism, it's a competitive advantage.  Fourth, we regularly review other cash return options, specifically special dividends and share buybacks. Yesterday we declared a special dividend for the second time in 2021 and updated our share buybacks authorization. Share buybacks have always been part of our playbook and will remain an opportunistic cash return alternative. We are cognizant of the challenges of successfully executing a share buybacks in a cyclical industry. We now expect there will be periods in the future when the stock will be impacted by macro factors, such as the commodity cycle, geopolitical events, and other unforeseen events like the COVID pandemic in 2020. The updated $5 billion authorization provides the flexibility to act and take advantage when the right opportunity presents itself.  We believe our strategy for the use of other cash return options is well designed to deliver value through the cycle. Finally, we're not in the market for expensive M&A in a simply a low return proposition. We can create much more value through organic reinvestment and our shareholders can do better with their excess cash our premium strategy generates back in their hands. Since our shift to premium in 2016, EOG has generated nearly $10 billion of free cash flow. With that cash flow, EOG has reduced debt $1.5 billion. Increased the cash balance by $3.6 billion. And we'll return more than $5 billion to shareholders by the end of 2021, this is a significant amount of shareholder value driven by premium. Today, EOG is positioned to translate that value creation into even more cash returns to shareholders. In the third quarter, we generated a record $1.4 billion of free cash flow, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to $3.5 billion, which is equal to the total return of capital paid and committed this year to our regular dividend, to special dividends, and debt repayment. You can expect us to continue returning cash going forward. There might be times when we strategically increased or decreased the cash balance, but over time, the cash will go back to our shareholders. Here's Billy. Billy Helms : Thanks, Tim. As a result of the -- to the consistency of our operating performance, we delivered another quarter of outstanding results. I couldn't be more proud of the engagement of our employees and their culture of continuous improvement. Their execution of our 2021 plan has been near perfect. For the third quarter in a row, we produced more oil for less capital. That is, we exceeded our production targets while spending less than our forecast for capital expenditures. Well, productivity driven by our double premium hurdle rate continues to out perform while our drilling and completion teams pushed the [Indiscernible], on new sustainable cost savings and expand those efficiencies throughout our active operating areas. Examples include in-sourcing and re-designing drilling equipment, adopting innovative techniques to reduce nonproductive time, expanding super zipper completion operations, and reducing sand and water-sourcing cost.  Our ability to continue to lower cost and deliver reliable execution quarter after quarter is tied to common set of operating practices that together form a sustainable competitive advantage for EOG. First, we are a multiplay Company, with activities spread across 4 different basins in the U.S. As conditions change, we have the flexibility to shift capital between place to optimize returns. Second, we are organized under a decentralized structure. Decisions are made by discrete focused teams, closer to the operation, rather than dictated by headquarters. Our culture is non-bureaucratic and entrepreneurial. We empower our front line employees to make decisions, bringing them to drive innovation and efficiency improvement. Third, we have established strategic vendor relationships with our preferred service providers.  We are typically -- we're not typically the biggest beneficiary of price reductions during downturns. We also tend to not be on the leading edge of price increases during inflationary periods. Fourth, we have taken ownership of the value-added parts of the drilling, completions, and production supply chain by applying our operational expertise, proprietary technology to improve efficiency and lower cost. Examples include sand, water, chemicals, drilling fluids, completion design, drilling motors, the marketing of our products, and much more. As a result, our operating teams have complete ownership of driving improvements in every step. And finally, we apply a world-class information technology to every part of our operations. Our data-gathering and analysis capabilities improve -- continue to improve, which we leveraged to better manage day-to-day field operations for more efficient use of resources, as well as discovering new innovations. As a result of these strategic advantages, we are confident in achieving our target of 7% well cost savings this year.  This is an incredible accomplishment given the state of inflation. As we move into next year, we're on track to lock in 50% of our total well cost by the end of this year. We have locked in 90% plus of our drilling rigs at rates that are flat to lower than 2020 and 2021. We've also secured more than 50% of our completion crews at favorable rates. While it is still early, the savings from these initiatives and other improvement efforts will continue to be realized next year, helping us offset the risk of additional inflation. And thus we remain confident that we will be able to keep well cost at least flat in 2022. Now, here's Kent. Ken Boedeker : Thanks, Billy. Last month we published our 2020 sustainability report. As detailed in this report, we are focused on reducing emissions in the field. Our flaring intensity rate decreased 43% in 2020 compared to 2019, which drove an overall 9% reduction in greenhouse gas intensity. We continue to make progress toward our goal of zero routine flaring across all our operations by 2025, with our more immediate goal of 99.8% wellhead gas capture this year. We also made significant progress on methane last year, reducing our methane emissions percentage by 1/3 to less than 1/10 of 1% of our natural gas production. Since 2017, we've reduced our methane emission intensity percentage by 80%. Our sustainability report profiles that technology and innovation that contributed to these improvements and illustrates why we are optimistic about future performance on our path to net-zero by 2040. Examples of how we are addressing emissions in the field include closed loop gas capture, which helps us continue to reduce flaring. We're leveraging information technology and our extensive data analysis capabilities from both mobile platforms and our central control rooms to better manage day-to-day operations. In addition, we're piloting technology in the field, such as sensors and control devices that complement our already robust leak detection program. These are just a few examples of the initiatives we have underway. Like all efforts to the EOG, our sustainability strides are bottom-up driven. Creative ideas to improve our ESG performance come from employees working in our operating areas every day. We have a long list of solutions we expect to pilot and profile in the future. Our record of significantly reducing our GHG intensity over the last several years speaks for itself, and we're committed to continuing to improve our emissions performance. Now here's Ezra, to wrap things up. Ezra Yacob : Thank you, Ken. Our record-breaking operational and financial results throughout this year, and the cash returned announcements we made yesterday deserved to grab some headlines. However, the real story behind our performance is consistency of strategy supported by our unique culture. At the start of the call, I said there is no clear indication of the impact premium and now double premium has had on our confidence in EOG's future profitability than the annual $3 per share regular dividend. And while establishing the premium standard back in 2016 shifted us into a different year, culminating in the magnitude of our cash return this year. Our fundamental strategy executed year-after-year by employees united by unique culture dates back to the founding of the Company. That's ultimately what gives me confidence that EOG's best days are ahead. We are a return-focused organic exploration Company that leverages technology and innovation to always get better. Decentralized, non-bureaucratic. Every employee is a business person first focused on creating value in the field at the asset level. Our financial strategy has always been and remains conservative, not just to offset the inherent risks in a cyclical business, but to take advantage of them. We're committed to the regular dividend and believe it is the best way to create consistent and dependable long-term value for shareholders. We have a proven track record that our strategy works and going forward, investors can expect more of the same consistent execution year after year. Thanks for listening. We'll now go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions]. Questions are limited to 1 question and 1 follow-up question. We will take as many questions as time permits. [Operator Instructions]. If you find your question has been answered, you may remove yourself by [Operator Instructions]. We'll pause for a moment to give everyone an opportunity signal for questions. Our first question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning. 2 questions, please. First, you have the authorization for the buyback, but quite frankly, I don't recall EOG ever done any buyback for the past 20 years. So can you talk about what is the condition or criteria to -- for you to actually act on it? And in theory, if you're going to buy it when the market is suffering the downturn, does that mean that you should have a really strong bond in circling into the downturn maybe at a net cash position, so -- in order for you to be able to afford it. My last [Indiscernible] saying that at the top the pandemic, your share pie as really attractive, but I'm not sure that you have the [Indiscernible] or that the will to do the buybacks at that point. That's the first question. The second question is on the hedging, you have been quite aggressive, putting in a lot of natural gas hedges. Curious that with your low break-even requirement and very strong Balance Sheet, why put on hedges so aggressively onto some degree even though you have a physical barrel of [Indiscernible] that to support you. But is that the fundamental basic you said you could become a speculation on the direction of the commodity prices. When you're doing it that way? Thank you. Ezra Yacob : Yes this is Ezra. Paul, thanks for the question. Let me start by outlining a little bit on the buyback and then I'll hand it to Tim Driggers for a little more detail on it. You're right, we're buyback authorization. We've had one previously and we haven't exercise that, in quite some time. What we've done right now as we've refreshed it to a size that's a little more commensurate with the scale of our Company today. And we plan to exercise the buybacks in more of an opportunistic way, rather than something problematic is how we expect to be able to use it and I'm going to ask Tim to provide you a little more details on exercising it. Tim Driggers : Sure. Turn my microphone, I'm sorry. First of all, we will evaluate buybacks like any other investment decision, how does it creates long-term shareholder value? So that will be the first thing we'll have to look at every time we make this decision. Specifically to answer your question about could we have started during the pandemic but didn't have the financial wherewithal to do that, you're exactly right. At that point in time, oil was negative, the price oil was negative and we had two bonds coming to -- totaling $1 billion. So had we been in the shape we're in today, that would've been a perfect time to buy shares. But we weren't in that same position we are today. That's how -- that's why continuing to work on the balance sheet and positioning ourselves for the future has been so important to EOG. So we should not ever have that situation again. We have positioned the Company to be able to opportunistically take advantage of these situations. Ezra Yacob : And following on the second question regarding our hedges, specifically gas, but really in general, our hedging strategy hasn't changed at all. As you know, we invest on a very, very stringent hurdle rate, our premium and now double-premium rate. That's based on a $40 oil price, but it's also based on a $2.50 natural gas price for the life of the well. And so when we can opportunistically look to lock in some hedges north of $3, we feel very good about the returns that we're generating going forward on the gas price. In general, we like to have a bit of hedges put on whether oil or gas, just give us a little bit of line of sight into our budgeting process as we enter into a new year. And so really that's the commentary on both the gas and the oil hedges. Operator : The next question will come from Arun Jayaram. Please go ahead. Arun Jayaram : Good morning. Ezra, the 2021 cash return to equity holders as tally just under 30% of CFO, if you add in debt, it's around 36% of your CFO. I know there's no formal framework in place, but how should investors be thinking about cash returns on a go-forward basis and could this 30% be viewed at some sort of the benchmark? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Arun. This is Ezra. No, I wanted to -- I would not take that as any type of benchmark. I think we've been very clear for the last couple of years in talking about our framework for cash return, really just our free cash flow priorities. The emphasis -- the priority really is on a sustainable growing regular dividend. We think that's the hallmark. It's forward-looking and that's the hallmark of a very strong Company. Hopefully, it sends a signal to everybody the -- of our confidence in the growing capital efficiency of our Company. Obviously, we've talked about some low cost property bolt-on acquisitions. We've highlighted those on the last call and in the slide deck today. we've obviously covered a very strong, not just strong, but really a pristine Balance Sheet.  And then to the last part of -- really the other part of your question is our other cash returns options for excess-free cash flow, which is the special dividend, and then as Tim was just mentioning, some of the share repurchases. And as we've said, we're very committed to returning excess-free cash flow. We have stayed away from a specific formula because, we'd like to be able to -- we try not to run the Company on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We tried to take a longer view of things. We realized that there are times when potentially the cash on hand may need to move up or down. But regardless of it over the long term, I think we've demonstrated, especially this year, that we're very committed to returning that excess free cash flow. Arun Jayaram : Great. And my follow-up, with the dividend increase to $3 on an annualized basis, as well that will represent just over $1.75 billion in annual outlays to equity holders for the dividend, how should investors be thinking about future growth? Does this temper how we should think about longer-term production growth given the higher mix of dividend payments? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Arun. The step-up this year in the regular dividend is really a reflection of what we've been doing for the last 5 years in reinvesting this -- in the premium wells. We've been seeing it slowly but surely show up in our financial performance as we've lowered the cost basis of the Company. And the confidence going forward really is what we're seeing with our change in focus over the past 18 months to these double -premium wells. We feel that it's providing another step change in operational performance that should filter through to a step change in financial performance as we've witnessed with that change to premium. And then our inventory, of course, is spread across multiple basins. We have 5,800 of these double -premium locations and over 11,000 of the premium locations, and we're adding to that every day.  Our employees are working through either low -- identifying low cost bolt-on acquisition opportunities, sustainable well-cost reductions, as we've highlighted this quarter's stronger well productivity, and then, of course, our low - cost entry into organic exploration opportunities to further expand both the quantity and the quality of that inventory. So I think as we continue moving forward and sticking to our game plan of investing in double premium, it has the potential to continue to expand the free cash flow potential of EOG and thereby continue to provide an opportunity for us to remain committed to sustainably growing our dividend. Operator : Our next question will come from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeanine Wai : Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. Our first question is on the special dividend. In terms of the timing and the process for that, when you looked at the potential to announce one, what did you see this time around that perhaps you didn't see last quarter when you decided to forego a special dividend? Tim Driggers : Jeanine, this is Tim, so as already been stated, we are committed to our free cash flow parties and that has not changed. So we look at all the factors every quarter to determine when is the right time to do either special dividend, or nail the share buybacks, or increase the regular dividend. So when we looked at our cash balance at September 30, was sitting at $4.3 billion. That gives us -- that leaves us well-positioned to pay off our bond in 2023 and provide this $2 special dividend. So it's a combination of all those factors and we felt this was a meaningful amount of cash to return at this time. Jeanine Wai : Okay, great. And then my second question, maybe following up on Arun 's question on the base dividend. The large increase in the base, it seems like it's a catch-up to close the gap between what the business can support given the premium and double premium wells like you just said, and what was actually getting paid out. So I guess in terms of the timing also on the base, we're just curious how much of a factor the potential that you now see in your exploration plays factored into the decision to increase the base. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Jeanine, this is Ezra again. It's not just the exploration plays, it's really just our confidence and being able to expand the overall inventory, the quality of the inventory into that double premium. And some of it comes from the announcements that you saw on this quarterly on the quarter results, the stronger well productivity supporting better than guidance volumes, the better than guidance capex driven by sustainable well cost reductions. When I think about that, I think about our existing inventory increasing in performance and quality. And then I think about converting some of our premium wells into double premium status. And then of course we have identified small bolt-on acquisitions where we can continue to grow and expand that inventory level for us. And then as you highlighted, we've got the organic exploration mix.  We're drilling 15 wells this year that we've talked about that are not in the publicly disclosed place. Those places are at various states of either initial drilling, collecting of data, or evaluating as we've talked about on other calls, repeatability production performance of those plays. And so we're very excited and confident in our ability to continue to expand. And as I said increased the quality of our double premium inventory. And ultimately that's what gives us the confidence to be able to see that we can continue to lower the cost base of the Company, increased the capital efficiency of EOG, and continue to support a sustainably growing base dividend, which is our commitment. Operator : Our next question will come from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Scott Gruber : Yes. Good morning. In your deck, you mentioned a carbon capture pilot project, which is interesting. Ezra, can you speak to your early ambitions in carbon capture? Are you looking strictly at the [Indiscernible] are you investigating pure storage? And what level of resources having committed internally to the initiative? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Scott. I appreciate the question. I'm going to ask Ken Boedeker to address it. Ken Boedeker : Yes, Scott. We're continuing to make good progress on that initial carbon capture project that we've talked about. We've finalized many of the below-ground geologic studies and we're currently working on the engineering and regulatory portions of the project. As we work our way through these steps, we'll get more clarity on timing. But right now we hope to initiate CO2 injection in late 2022. In terms of capital that we're allocating towards it, it's roughly 2% to 3% of our budget is going to be allocated towards all of our ESG projects, is what we see. Scott Gruber : Ken, and as you investigate the opportunity, how are you thinking about participating in the value chain, would you be interested in entering transports? Obviously, it's an exciting opportunity, but it gets more capital intensive where you kind of broaden participation. Just how are you thinking about the broader opportunity in participating across the value chain? Ken Boedeker : Scott, we're really not going to change the business that we're in. We're looking at carbon capture right now to significantly reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions at this point. That business is a much lower return business than what we see with our development that we have. So we'll keep an eye on that but our real goal for carbon capture is just reducing our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions which we've made significant progress on in the last several years. Operator : Our next question will come from [Indiscernible] with KeyBanc, please go ahead. Leo Mariani : Hey, guys. Just looking at the guidance here for fourth quarter, we can certainly see some pretty significant growth on U.S. gas. Obviously, looking at gas prices right now, we're at multi-year highs at this point in time. Should we see that as a bit of a signal that EOG is perhaps flexing up a little bit on the natural gas side to try to capture what it probably some fantastic returns at the current prices here. Billy Helms : Yes, Leo. This is Billy Helms. So on the capex side, certainly part of our program as we laid out earlier this year, was just advanced some of Dorado prospect in South Texas, as you know, it's a very competitive gas play with rest of the place in the U.S. And we've been very pleased with the results here. But we may -- we remain disciplined to only completes the 15 wells we targeted and laid out at the start of this year. It's really a little bit early to be talking about what we're going to look like next year. But obviously with the results we're seeing, we're very pleased with the results being -- meeting or exceeding the top curves we have laid out, that certainly gives us an option to look at increasing activity there. Billy Helms : It's a little bit early yet to be saying what we're going to do next year, but we're very pleased with what we're seeing. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. And obviously in your prepared comments, you still spoke about the fact that probably be challenging to meet all the necessary conditions at year-end '21 that you all have laid out to put any type of real oil growth back in the market at this point in time. But I guess we -- I've certainly heard some rumblings lately that perhaps we might already be in pre -pandemic demand levels here as we work our way into November. I think OPEC+ has a plan to reduce its spare capacity pretty dramatically by mid '22. Just wanted to get a sense if you think perhaps in the mid to second half part of '22, there's a good shot at hitting the conditions that EOG laid out to potentially put a little growth back in the market. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Leo. This is Ezra. As Billy said, typically we don't provide guidance for the following year on this call but in general, our focus on 2022, the potential for that and us, as you highlighted, the things that we're looking at, we're focused on remaining disciplined and that hasn't changed. As we look into 2022, they are the 3 items that you've referenced that should signal a bit of a balanced market. First is demand, which has probably surprised to the upside a bit with just how quickly we've approached pre-COVID levels. The second is going to be the inventory numbers, which for us we'd like to see at or below the 5-year average, which they're currently there right now. But that brings up that third item that you spoke to, which is the spare capacity. And we'd like to see that spare capacity back to low levels more in line with historic trends. So as we sit here today, 2022 is looking like a year of transition. Spare capacity is going to come back online at this scheduled rates. That should translate into rising inventory levels and if things move forward, we could be looking at a balanced market sometime in the first half of '22. For us, for EOG in a scenario like that, we could probably return to maybe, our pre \u2013 Covid levels of oil production around that 465,000 barrel a day mark. That would represent no more than 5% growth next year. But again, that's as we are sitting here today, we will be officially firming up that 2022 plan or watching how the market develops over the next couple of months.  But as we're witnessing, bringing spare capacity back online has hit some snags as we're watching to see if that more routine startup challenges or is that more structural in nature due to under investment and those 2 factors are going to be just as important as seen, how the continued demand recovery COVID really develops with any potential future lock down, so on and so forth. So ultimately, we continue to remain to be disciplined going forward. Operator : Our next question will come from Charles Meade with [Indiscernible], please go ahead. Charles Meade : Morning, Ezra, to you and the whole EOG team there. You actually anticipated a large part of my question with your answer to the last one. But maybe just to dial in on it a little more closely, how far out do you think your view holds or your ability to look at the balance or unbalance in the oil market? And then once you did see a call to increase your oil activity, how long would it be before we actually saw it in the public markets in your quarterly financials? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Charles. Thanks for the question. I'll answer the first part of it and then ask Billy to provide a little bit more color also. How far out we can see the balance or the imbalance? To be perfectly honest, we're watching a lot of the same things that all of you are. Those 3 things that we highlighted. Demand has recovered pretty aggressively, I would say. I think it's surprised everybody. And then the inventory numbers in concert with the spare capacity coming back online. And the spare capacity again, if you simply look at the schedules that have been laid out and everybody sticks to the schedules and the supply actually comes back online. That would contemplate sometime in the front half of the year. But as I highlighted, and everyone has been seeing, there are some challenges or hurdles to getting all that spare capacity back online. As far as the -- the color on what we would be looking at, perhaps Billy can speak to it. Billy Helms : Yeah, Charles. For as far as how long it would take before we would see any response basically showing up in our financials. If you just simply look at, when we see the signal and the time we deploy rigs and get the wells completed, non-production takes usually 3 to 4 months. So you'd start seeing it no earlier than that, but probably sometime a quarter or 2 after. So to have a meaningful difference in financial performance. Charles Meade : Got it. So, if I'm understanding you correctly, it's -- it would be 2 quarters, maybe you start to see it nearly 3 quarters before there was a real Delta. Billy Helms : That's correct. Charles Meade : Great. And then just one quick follow-up for Tim. And I think you partly address this in your earlier comments. In the past, I recall you guys have talked about a target of $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet. With this new $5 billion share authorization in a slightly different posture about wanting to have some dry powder, does that mean that your target for $2 billion in cash, and I recognize you're not always going to be at the target, but does that mean that the target has gone north of that? And if so, has it gone to 3 or 4 or what's your thinking? Tim Driggers : No, we haven't changed our target. We will continue to monitor that through the cycle and see there's all sorts of factors we have to take into consideration for the cash balance. As you know, working capital changes, for example, as prices swing up and down, so that's a big consideration. But no, it has not changed -- the authorization has not changed our philosophy on the cash balance. Operator : Our next question will come from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Neal Dingmann : Good morning, all. I don't want to belabor this just on the growth and reinvestment. But Ezra just want to make sure I'm clear on this, you guys have been quite clear about returns. I just want to make sure that I'm certain around the priority about the moderating reinvestment rate in order to drive the cash returns. Is that what I'm hearing over growth? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Neil. When we think about moving forward, we've done a lot on reinvesting in building this Company to take a bit of a step away from the commodity price cycles by focusing in on the premium wells and now double premium strategy. The growth for us has always been an output of our ability to reinvest at high rates of return, through 2017 to 2019 during a period of rapid growth for the industry. In fact, we're reinvesting only at a rate of about 78% and still generating free cash flow every year, and putting that towards an aggressively growing base dividend. So the strategy for us hasn't really changed. I think we've talked about potentially watching the macro environment a little bit more to help formulate our plans year-to-year. And that's where it falls in line with what we've been discussing over the last couple of questions. We still remain very committed to that. We don't want to push barrels into a market that's oversupplied or doesn't need the barrels. And so we'll be looking for the right time to see if the market needs our barrels before contemplating any return to growth. Neal Dingmann : Very good, very clear. And then follow up on -- that earlier about you. It looks like you all had been added a little bit of gas hedges. Is that in relation to -- does that mean that you're you've been increasing the focus on the Dorado play given what natural gas prices are doing, so I guess I'm just wondering, is that are the 2 correlated or are you adding to that activity in the Dorado? Billy Helms : Yeah. Neil, this is Billy Helms. As far as the volume of gas hedges and then what we've been doing there, really it's not focused strictly on Dorado, it simply goes back to our premium strategy that as we just laid out, it's based on a $40 oil and a $2.50 gas price. We saw the opportunity to lock in gas prices is above $3. So it gave us encouragement of locking in returns over the next several years at those prices. We have gas production quite a bit as you know in Dorado, but also quite a bit in other places as well. So it just helps ensure locking in returns over a multi-year period. Operator : Our next question will come from Scott Hanold with RBC. Please go ahead. Scott Hanold : Yes. Thanks. I'm going to try, Ezra, I know you'll probably give me the answer that you'll talk about the budget next year. But if I could talk about a more big picture, if we all think of just a base maintenance spending levels into 2022. Would -- has the capital changed too much from what you all did this year? Like what would be the puts and takes from that? Because it seems like your well-cost, you're going hold pretty steadily. So is your maintenance capex case this year somewhat similar to what it would be next year all else being equal or are there anything else to consider? Ezra Yacob : Yeah, Scott. This is Ezra and we'll talk about next year's budget, next year. So that a little bit facetiously for you, but quite frankly, I think we haven't updated our maintenance capital number yet. We'll provide that number commensurate with our plans laid out next year. But I think what you can see is that our team continues to make great progress and sustainable well cost reductions through their efficiency gains on applying innovation and technology. And I think Billy highlighted pretty well that we feel very confident that we achieved our first initial goal, I should say 5% well cost reduction and were in line to reduce our cost 7% this year. And we feel that a lot of those costs are what's going to insulate us against some of the inflationary pressures out there. Scott Hanold : And how about just on -- was there anything unusual you'd say this year that we should think about next year in terms of exploration play or ESG spending? Is that -- is there any reason for us to think about that any differently? Ezra Yacob : No, Scott. Really over the last few years, a lot of our percentage dedicated towards exploration and ESG have been pretty consistent. Operator : Our next question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate : Good morning, everybody. Ezra, I think your share price reaction today, I think, you can see the market's response to be greater cash returns. I'm wondering, why is it reluctant, seemingly still from EOG to provide a framework around the proportion of cash returns. It seems to be a persistent body or perhaps the recognition of sustainable free cash flow, which at the end of the day is what defines the value. I'm just wondering why there is reluctance not to commit to at least lay out framework as to how you think about the go-forward cash returns as opposed to one of those special dividend? Ezra Yacob : Yes. Doug, It's a question that we've been answering and we feel that we have provided a framework for our free cash flow priorities. It's as you mentioned, the sustainable growing base dividend to strengthen the Balance Sheet, these low-cost property acquisitions, and then more on point with your question, the other cash returns options which are special dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. And in a lot of ways, when we look back, I think we've shown our commitment to that. Not only this year with committing to $2.7 billion return in dividends over a year-to-date free cash flow generation of about 3.5 billion.  But I think we added a slide into the deck that shows longer-term what we've been able to do in providing just over $5 billion of free cash flow returns since 2016 on about $10.9 billion of free cash flow were generated. And so I think we've laid out a framework, I think our 2 announcements this year on special dividends totaling $3 per share on the specials, really demonstrates our commitment to it and as far as having the ability for our investors to see through and capitalize on that number. I think we've demonstrated our commitment to the point where the investors can capitalize on some of our excess free cash flow. To us, we still remain committed to delivering on those free cash flow priorities. We do want to continue to make decisions based on what we think will create the most significant long-term shareholder value. And that means sometimes not necessarily running the business on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but really taking a longer-term approach. And so locking ourselves into a formula that might have to change as conditions change, is really at the heart of our reluctance to do that. Doug Leggate : I understand that. I guess, it's a moving piece. Maybe my follow-up is related then. I want to talk specifically about the buybacks. There's been a lot of reference to the '16, '19 period. And you know the history; it was a subsidized environment. You doubled production. Saudi was taking oil off the market, and we will see how that ended. We know what the response to the industry has been, but I want to get specifically to your view of mid-cycle and how you think then about the relative priorities around mid-cycle. What is your definition of mid-cycle? And how should we think about growth versus growth per share, given the buyback commencement? Ezra Yacob : Well, Doug, I don't think I'm comfortable getting into mid-cycle metrics on here. But what I would tell you is we continue to think of this buyback as opportunistic. We think, again, with our authorization in place, we want to use it in a way that we feel confident we're going to be generating long-term shareholder value. More often than not for us, that's going to tend towards special dividends. And we're going to reserve our buyback authorizations to be used really just in times of dislocations and use it opportunistically rather than a more programmatic method. Operator : Our next question will come from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research, please go ahead. Bob Brackett : Good morning. It looks like you turned a couple of pads on in Dorado in the third quarter. Any color or commentary there; hitting expectations, exceeding? Ken Boedeker : Yeah. Bob, this is Ken. As Billy said earlier, we have turned on several wells in the last few months and the color is all of them are at or above our type curve and what our plans were, going into the year. We do have one-drilling rig act even in the play right now and we're really moving rapidly up the learning curve. Again, just to reiterate, this play has really double premium returns and it's competitive for capital with our oil plays. Bob Brackett : Great. Thanks for that. Operator : Our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Neil Mehta : Good morning, Tim. Ezra, every new CEO has an opportunity to put their own thumbprint on the business and recognize that you're part of the prior leadership team as well, but just talk about your early observations as the new leader of the organization. Any subtle changes that you're making and talking about your messages to your internal and external stakeholders that you want the market to be aware of? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Neil, appreciate the question and the opportunity. I think the bigger thing for our investors, our employees, everyone who is listening to the call is that EOG has got a proven track record. Our strategy works the shift to premium strategy has put us on a different trajectory and the shift to double premium is going to as well. The culture of EOG, the people that EOG has always been our competitive advantage, and that will continue to be that way. Honestly, Neil, the most important thing we can do as a leadership team, is put our employees in a position to succeed, where they can really contribute to the best of their abilities. And that's where we try to do every day and that's going to translate into not only our operational performance, that would you see the results of this quarter, but to our financial performance as well. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Ezra and the follow-up is I appreciated the slide that shows the breakdown of the well costs in how you guys are ahead of your competition in terms of managing and medicating some of these inflationary pressures. As you step back and think about the U.S. oil industry broadly, do you think this is ultimately going to be a challenge, these inflationary pressures, to restart the shale machine? And which of these bottlenecks or do you worry about the most in terms of being a constraint on the ability for the industry to grow again? Billy Helms : Yeah, Neil, this is Billy Helms. Certainly as industry is seeing, we're seeing quite a bit of an inflationary pressure mainly in three areas that would say steel process. So tubulars, labor which is certainly affects all industries. And then fuel, those are probably the three inflationary pressures that are throughout our industry and really throughout the all industries. The one thing that I think is going to be, or maybe two things, two top priorities would be probably steel. I think availability of tubulars is something that I think most companies are struggling with or dealing with, I guess. And then, the other one would be labor and just getting enough people to manage the activity levels. Just to maybe give you a little bit color then on where EOG sits. Each year we try to get ahead of the curve and lock in a certain amount of our services to secure activity. But in this case, also protect us from inflation.  For instance, in 2021 we protected about a 65% of our well costs going into the year. As a result of that, plus the improving efficiencies, we're able to reduce our average well costs by about 7%, as that stated earlier. During the year though, we also took advantage and renegotiated many of our services at lower rates and locked in through and through the end of next year. So going into 2022, we expect to have about 50% of our well cost secured and with over 90% of our drilling rigs secured at lower rates and also 50% of our frac fleets secured. We expect to see inflation certainly in arms of such as steel, labor, and fuel just like everybody else. But by doing that, we've given ourselves visibility into areas of also improving efficiencies that we expect to offset much of this inflation. So we're still confident, we can keep well cost. At least flat going into next year. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Scialla with Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Scialla : Hi. Good morning. It's a high level question. Ezra, on your long-term outlook, as you think about the energy transition, how are you thinking about oil versus natural gas? Is there any preference there in or any of the exploration plays focused on gas or they all on oil? Ezra Yacob : Yes. Thank you, Michael. Long term, we believe the hydrocarbons are going to have a -- be a significant part of the energy solution long term. Obviously, we need to do as an industry a better job with our emissions profile. But when you think about oil and natural gas, they both go to different markets dominantly, your natural gas essentially is more on your power side and potentially in direct competition with things such as coal and your renewables. And then your oil transportation. Your oil obviously is a little more focused on transportation. In general when I think longer-term, I think the energy transition is going to be significantly slower than often times you hear about. And we're very bullish on the prospects for both. As far as the exploration plays goes as we've said in the past, dominantly the exploration plays are all oil-focused. Michael Scialla : Okay, thanks for that. Ken, you had said on your CO2 pilot -- excuse me, your CCS pilot. I think you said you plan to inject in late '22, that seems to suggest you would not need a Class six permits. I'm wondering, is it fair to say you're reinjecting CO2 into an EOR project? And when you say it's not really economically competitive with your upstream business, are you planning on capturing 45 tax credits with any of your projects? Ken Boedeker : Michael, this is Ken. To answer your question on the tax credit side, we are planning on capturing was 45Q tax credits. Our goal in terms of foot class or permit that we would secure. We believe that we will initially secure a class 2 permit that can be converted, will go through all of the regulatory requirements to be able to convert it to a class 6 later in its life. But that's what the plan is for our CCS project at this point. Operator : Our next question will come from Paul Sankey of Sankey Research. Please go ahead. Paul Sankey : Hi, guys. Just very quickly on -- can you talk about your LNG or what downstream natural gas strategy? Thanks. Billy Helms : Hey, good morning. This is Helms. Paul Sankey : Hey. Billy Helms : Thanks for your question. And good morning. We're -- the team is definitely executing. You've seen several of our slides that we've put back, talking a lot about our transportation position is so incredibly valuable. We can move gas from all our different basins, from the Permian Basin, from the Eagle Ford, we talked a lot about Dorado earlier. And then with that and it gets access as you look along the Golf Course and you look at the LNG demand, especially that's growing over time. Obviously, you know, we've got a position there that we started. And just really speaks to being a first mover, especially, when you think about LNG. We went through a whole BD effort, kind of 17 and 18, we got the contracts finalized in 2020. And in 2021, obviously, we're definitely seeing the value of that contract. So being a first-mover is absolutely important. And yes, we're going to continue to look at new opportunities from an LNG standpoint, very well-positioned. Again, it gets back to our transport, our export capacities, and just having that ability to transact, we can definitely be very nimble as we even think about new opportunities. Paul Sankey : Got it. And then a follow-up on the buybacks. I'm not clear. Are you saying that it's a shelf ability to buybacks shares when you want? Or are you actually going to try and get through this amount in the next 12 months? Tim Driggers : Hi, Paul. This is Tim. We do not have a timeline on when we plan to buy back the $5 billion. When the opportunity presents itself, we will be in the market. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Yacob for any closing remark. Ezra Yacob : We just want to thank each of you for participating in our call this morning and thank our shareholders for their support. As I highlighted at the start of the call, EOG's competitive advantage is our employees and they deserve all the credit for delivering another outstanding quarter. So thank you and enjoy the weekend. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir. Tim Driggers : Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliations schedules for those non-GAAP measures can be found on the EOG's website. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chief Executive Officer; Billy Helms, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Jeff Leitzell, EVB, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor & Public Relations. Here's Ezra. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. 2021 was a record-setting year for EOG. We earned record net income of $4.7 billion, generated a record $5.5 billion of free cash flow, which funded record cash return of $2.7 billion to shareholders. We doubled our regular dividend rate and paid 2 special dividends, paying out about 30% of cash from operations. And we are continuing to deliver on our free cash flow priorities this year with an additional special dividend announced yesterday of $1 per share. The last time we set an earnings record was in 2014. We earned $5.32 per share while oil averaged $93. Last year, we shattered that record earning $7.09 per share with $68 oil. That's 50% higher earnings with a 27% lower oil price. The catalyst for that improvement was our shift to premium 6 years ago. Premium is our internal investment hurdle rate that uses low fixed commodity prices to calculate the returns that drive our capital allocation decisions, $40 and $2.50 natural gas for the life of the well. While our premium strategy ensures high well-level returns and quick payouts in any given year, the more significant and durable impact is to our full-cycle development costs. The benefit of making investment decisions using fixed low commodity prices has the enduring impact of steadily improving corporate level operating and cash margins over time. That impact is now directly observable on the face of our financial statements. And last year, we raised the bar again to double premium. Our hurdle rate increased from 30% to a minimum of 60% direct after-tax rate of return using the same low fixed prices of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. The switch promises to further improve financial performance in the years ahead and is what gives us great confidence in our ability to continue delivering shareholder value through commodity price cycles. We expect to look back on 2021 like we do on 2016 as the year we made a permanent increase to our return hurdle that drove another step change in the financial performance of EOG. We also delivered as we promised operationally in 2021 with production volumes, CapEx and operating costs in line or better than target set at the beginning of the year. We were able to successfully offset emerging inflationary pressures during the year to lower well costs by 7%. 2021 was also a big year for ESG performance. We reduced our methane emissions percentage and injury rates and increased water reuse. We announced our 2040 net-zero ambition and added our goal to eliminate routine flaring by 2025 to our existing near-term targets for greenhouse gas and methane emissions rates. We continue to develop creative solutions, leveraging existing technology to make progress on our path towards our net-zero ambition. There's growing recognition that oil and gas will have a role to play in the long-term energy solution. We know that to be part of that solution, we not only have to produce low-cost, high-return barrels, we also have to do it with one of the lowest environmental footprints. As we look into 2022, the global oil market is in a position to rebalance during the year. Our disciplined capital plan aims to increase long-term shareholder value through high-return reinvestment that optimizes both near-term and long-term free cash flow. The plan also funds exploration and infrastructure projects to improve the future cost structure of the business. With the improvements we made in the business last year, combined with a higher commodity price environment, EOG is positioned to once again generate significant free cash flow. We continue to follow through on our free cash flow priorities. Our stellar fourth quarter performance allowed us to further strengthen the balance sheet, and we are returning cash to shareholders with the $1 per share special dividend declared yesterday. Combined with our $3 per share regular dividend, we have already committed to return $2.3 billion of cash to shareholders in 2022. We remain firmly committed to our long-standing free cash flow and cash return priorities, and you can expect EOG to continue to deliver on them as the year unfolds. EOG has exited the downturn a much better company than when we entered it. Higher returns with the shift to double premium, a lower cost structure, more free cash flow, a smaller environmental footprint and a culture strengthened by the challenges we have overcome together. Our culture is the number one value driver of EOG's success. By remaining humble and intellectually honest, we sustained the cycle of constant improvement that drives our technology leadership. Of all the fundamentals that consistently create long-term value, none of them matter without the commitment, resiliency and execution from our employees. Now here's Tim to review our financial position. Tim Driggers : Thanks, Ezra. EOG generated record financial results in the fourth quarter with adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion and free cash flow of $2 billion. Capital expenditures of $1.1 billion were right in line with our forecast while production volumes finished above target. For the full year, adjusted earnings were a record $5 billion or $8.61 per share. This yielded return on capital employed of 23%, while oil prices for the year averaged $68 per barrel. Perhaps most important than setting records is what drove our outperformance. 2021 illustrated EOG's success at driving down our cost structure. ROCE would have been 10% or better at oil prices as low as $44. Keep in mind that back in 2016, when the premium investment standard was introduced, the oil price required for 10% ROCE was in excess of $80 per barrel. The dramatic improvements will be made to the profitability of our business reflect the benefits of using the highest investment threshold in the industry. The bottom line financial impact of double premium is just beginning to show up. But like our original switch to premium, it will grow over the coming years. Our goal is to position the company to earn economic returns at the bottom of the cycle, less than $40 oil and generate returns that are better than the broader market on a full cycle basis. Free cash flow in 2021 was a record $5.5 billion, and we deployed this cash consistent with our long-standing free cash flow priorities. We doubled the regular dividend rate, which now stands at an annual $3 per share and represents a 2.7% yield at the current share price. We are confident in the sustainability of our high-return low cost business model to support a dividend that has never been cut or suspended in this more than 20-year history. We solidified our financial position, finishing the year with effectively 0 net debt. We were also able to address a dental cash return priorities. We paid 2 special dividends for a combined $3 per share. We also refreshed our buyback authorization, which now stands at $5 billion. We will look to utilize this on an opportunistic basis. In total, EOG returned $2.7 billion of cash to shareholders in 2021. This represents 28% of discretionary cash flow and 49% of free cash flow, putting EOG among E&P industry leaders for cash return in 2021. Looking ahead to 2022, our disciplined capital plan and regular dividend can be funded at $44 oil. At $80 oil, we expect to generate about $11 billion of cash flow from operations before working capital. The $4.5 billion capital plan represents about a 40%] reinvestment ratio, resulting in more than $6 billion in free cash flow. This, of course, is on an after-tax basis, as we expect to be a nearly full cash taxpayer in 2022 as we were last year. We are in an excellent position to continue to deliver on our free cash flow priorities in 2022. EOG declared a $0.75 regular dividend yesterday, which is our highest priority for returning cash to shareholders. The size of the regular dividend is evaluated every quarter. As the financial performance and cost structure of EOG continues to improve, we expect that will be reflected in continued growth of the dividend. Turning to our second priority. This period of high oil prices allows us to further bolster the balance sheet. To support our renewed $5 billion buyback authorization and prepare to take advantage of other countercyclical opportunities, we plan to build and carry a higher cash balance going forward. We expect there will be opportunities in the future to create significant shareholder value by deploying a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity at the right time. Finally, we also announced an additional cash return to shareholders yesterday with a $1 per share special dividend to be paid in March. Along with the regular dividend, EOG has already committed to return $2.3 billion of cash to shareholders in 2022. We are fully committed to continuing to deliver on all of our free cash flow priorities. Here's Billy. Lloyd Helms : Thanks, Tim. First, I want to thank all of our employees for their outstanding accomplishments and stellar execution last year. I'm especially proud of their safety performance. In addition to outstanding operations and financial improvements, we achieved a record low innovate and find opportunities to increase efficiencies and lowered the average well cost by 7%, beating the 5% target we set at the start of the year. Our drilling teams are achieving targeted depths faster with lower cost by focusing on reliability of the tools and technical procedures that drive daily performance. For example, in our Delaware Basin Wolfcamp play, our teams have improved days to drill by 42% since 2018. In our Eagle Ford oil play, after drilling several thousand wells, our teams continue to refine the drilling operation to drive consistent performance for our rig fleet, resulting in a 21% reduction in the drilling costs since 2018. And with our decentralized organization and collaborative teamwork across operational areas, we continue to generate ideas for improvement through our innovative approach to areas such as improved bit design and drilling motor performance and share them throughout the company. On the completion side, we made great starts to expand the use of our Super Zipper or simo-frac technique to about one-third of our wells completed last year. Completion costs also benefited from reduced sand and water cost through our integrated self-sourcing efforts and water reuse infrastructure. Utilizing local sand and water pipelines includes the added benefit of removing trucks from the row of contributing to a safer oilfield with lower emissions. Cash operating costs were in line with forecast. And while delivering a higher level of total production, they were nearly equivalent to our cash operating cost pre-pandemic in 2019. The savings are a result of a focus on reducing workover expenses and improvements in produced water management. These efforts will expand in 2022 to help offset additional inflationary pressure. We also had another great year improving our ESG performance metrics. Preliminary calculations indicate that we reduced our methane emissions percentage by about 25% and our total recordable incident rate by 10%. We also achieved a 99.8% target for wellhead gas capture and increased water resource from reuse to 55%. Again, these are preliminary results as our final metrics will be published in our sustainability report later this year. As we enter 2022, EOG is not immune to the inflation that we're seeing across our industry. But we have line of sight to offset these inflationary pressures through innovation and technical advances, contracting for services, supply chain management and self-sourcing and materials. Over 90% of our drilling fleet and over 50% of our frac fleets needed to execute this year's program are covered under existing term agreements with multiple providers. Our vendor partnerships provide EOG the ability to secure longer-term high-performing teams at favorable prices while providing the vendors a predictable and reliable source of activity to run their business. EOG's technical teams take ownership of various aspects of the drilling and completion operations to drive performance, improvements and eliminate downtime. As a result, we will -- we still see opportunities to sustainably improve our performance. Some of the largest efficiency gains will be in our completion operations this year. For example, we expect to utilize our Super Zipper technique on about 60% of our wells, increasing the amount of treated lateral per day. We're also enhancing our self-sourced local sand efforts, which we expect to not only secure the material needed for the year, but also offset the effects of inflation. We continue to expand our water reuse capabilities that will assist in offsetting inflation in both our capital program and lease operating expense. We remain confident that we'll be able to keep well cost at least flat in 2022. EOG's capital efficiency continues to improve as a result of EOG's culture of continuous improvement. 2022 looks to be a year of challenges and inflationary headwinds. And I'm excited about the opportunity to bring our talented employees to further improve our business through innovation and improved operational execution. Here's Ken to review the year-end reserves and provide an inventory update. Kenneth Boedeker : Thanks, Billy. Last year, we replaced more than 2x what we produced and reduced our finding and development costs by 17%. Our permanent shift to premium drilling and focus on efficiencies driven by innovation and our unique culture ease to why our capital efficiency continues to improve, and our corporate finding costs and DD&A rate continue to decline. Our 2021 reserve replacement was 208% for a finding and development cost of just $5.81 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding revisions due to commodity price changes. Since 2014, prior to the last downturn and the implementation of our premium strategy, we have reduced finding and development costs by more than 55%. With our double premium standard and the high grading of our future development schedule, we grew our reserve base in 2021 by over 500 million barrels of oil equivalent for total booked reserves of over 3.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent. This represents a 16% increase in reserves year-over-year. In terms of future well locations, we added over 700 net double premium locations across multiple basins to our inventory in 2021, replacing the 410 drilled last year by 170%. Our double premium inventory is growing faster than we drill it, and the quality of the locations we are adding to the inventory is improving. Innovation continues to drive sustainable cost improvements and operational efficiencies. And when you combine that with our focus on developing higher quality rock, we further improve the median return of the portfolio. We don't need more inventory. We are focused on improving our inventory quality. With this in mind, our double premium inventory now accounts for 6,000 of the 11,500 total premium locations in our inventory, representing more than 11 years of drilling at the current pace. Now let me turn the call back to Ezra. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Ken. In conclusion, I'd like to note the following important takeaways. First, investment decisions based on a low commodity price puts the emphasis on full cycle cost of development and demands efficient use of capital. While the benefits of such discipline are realized immediately, the larger impact builds over time. The seed to our stellar results in 2021 was the premium strategy established 6 years ago, and we have set the stage for the next step change in financial performance by instituting double premium last year. Second, we are confident EOG's innovative and technology-driven culture can offset inflationary pressures this year. Our disciplined capital plan is focused on high return reinvestment to continue improving our margins in not only 2022 but in future years as well. Third, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders. We demonstrated this through the return of nearly 50% of free cash flow last year, and this quarter's special dividend are third in less than a year. Doubling our regular dividend rate indicates our confidence in the durability of our future performance. The regular dividend is our preferred method to return cash to shareholders. And as we continue to increase the capital efficiency of EOG through low-cost operations and improved well performance, growth of the regular dividend will remain a priority. We truly believe the best is yet to come. Going forward as a company and an industry with a financial profile more competitive than ever with the broader market and a growing recognition of the value we bring to society, EOG has never been better positioned to generate significant long-term shareholder value. Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. The line is yours. Paul Cheng : First, we have been asked by many that with your CapEx plan and your production profile, if the current commodity price hold by mid-year, will you change the pan or that under what circumstances that, that plan may get revised? That's the first question. The second question is that in your future capital allocation, is 2022 the way how you will be a reasonable proxy in the future? Or we will see the percentage in the new domestic drilling, which is about 10% this year and also that the facility and the gathering and processing, those percentage will go up as a total percent of your CapEx as you're trying to prove up more new resource area? Ezra Yacob : Yes. Paul, this is Ezra. I'll answer the first question, and then I'll hand the second question over here to Billy to answer for you. With regards to our plan this year, as we've talked about, the way we're approaching our planning is not based on the oil price that we're seeing. We're really looking to see the broad market fundamentals that are underlying and supporting that oil price and other macroeconomic indicators. So when we look at our '22 plan, we think we've designed a very high-return capital program. It balances our free cash flow this year with increased free cash flow in future years. And it really starts with investing in the double premium wells. When we bring those low-cost reserves into the company's financials, it helps drive down the cost basis of the company and it continues to expand the margins. It's what allows us to continue delivering high corporate level returns as well as increase the cash flow potential of the company, and that further supports our free cash flow priorities. So the program this year is at a pace that allowed us to capture and incorporate technical learnings to continue to improve each of our assets. And that's the most important thing that we look to do every year, not only in 2022, but to go forward into future years as well. And I'll turn it over to Billy to answer the second part of the question. Lloyd Helms : Yes, Paul. On the second part of the question, going forward beyond 2022 and the percent we have allocated to new domestic drilling potential or really our exploration plays and infrastructure spend, it's been fairly consistent in the past and I expect it to be fairly consistent going forward. The largest amount of our CapEx spend will always be dedicated to our more developing -- development plays like the Delaware Basin play. And then going forward, we remain excited about the exploration potential we see in many of our new emerging plays. And we'll continue to fund those at a pace where we can continue to learn and get better just as Ezra mentioned. The infrastructure spend has always been about the same percentage each year, and I expect that will continue to be managed in the same way. We want to make sure that we get too far out in front with the infrastructure spending, but it's done at a pace commensurate with the development activity in a given area. So I expect that will continue to be the case. Operator : Our next question today comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Arun Jayaram : Yes. Global gas is clearly in focus right now. So I wanted to get your thoughts on the revamped agreement with which will provide you more linkage to JKM. I think today, you're selling about 140,000 MMBtu, and that increases to 420 over time. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of timing and shed some light on the type of realizations you get from marketing the gas to LNG? And how is the economic rent shared amongst you and Lance Terveen : Arun, this is Lance. I was just saying good morning. We're very excited about the new amendment that we have with And you're exactly right. I mean, we've got thousands that started in 2020. And I think that just really speaks to being really a first move or 2 because as you can see right now, you can look at the price realizations, you can see JKM spot prices are near $40, having that first-mover capability, moving quickly there to get that exposure is exactly right. As you mentioned in your question, it's been very impactful in a positive way as we think about our price realizations. We're very excited about the commitment. You're right, it ramps up. So we've got the 140 today that will ramp to 420 as they go into service. That's estimated to be probably with the first -- for Stage 3 in 2026. But if you remember there, we ramp up. We kind of go to the $140 today we started into the 420 as Stage 3 goes into service. And we still will maintain and we extended the 300,000 MMBtu a day sell that we have that's linked to Henry Hub. So we're excited about it. It's a brownfield facility. They've demonstrated being early on many of their projects. So we're excited to see our relationship grow from that standpoint and expect to see the price realizations materialize as well. Arun Jayaram : And my follow-up is just on the 2022 program. Ezra, you guided to 570 net wells, we want to get a bit more color on the decision to allocate more capital to the Delaware versus Eagle Ford? It looks like your Eagle Ford activity will be down, call it, more than 50% year-over-year, while your Delaware will be up 30% more, including a little bit more second bone activity. So I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color there. Lloyd Helms : Yes. Arun, this is Billy Helms. So yes, we're allocating a little bit more money to the Delaware Basin. And it's really just a function of the maturity of the Eagle Ford at this point. The Eagle Ford has been an active play for more than, I guess, 12 years and certainly has been a highly economic play for the company and continues to be. I would remind everybody that last year was the single best returns we've ever generated in the Eagle Ford play since its inception 12 years ago. And so it's still a very valuable play, but it is more mature. The Delaware Basin on the other hand is still a lot earlier in its maturity in this life cycle and still has a lot of opportunity to grow and test new horizons and expand our development capabilities over time. So it's just a lot younger in its maturity phase. So I think it naturally will command a little bit more activity on that side. Operator : Our next question today comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead. The line is yours. Doug Leggate : Last time I spoke to you, you were talking about the mix of the double premium wells in the production profile and of course the impact on sustaining capital and breakeven oil prices. So I wonder if you could just walk us through how you see that? The 32 breakeven you've given us today obviously comes with a, I guess, some element of growth in the capital. So how do you see the sustaining capital? How do you see that breakeven trending? That's my first question. Ezra Yacob : Yes. Doug, this is Ezra. Thanks for the question. Yes, our maintenance capital on the back of a 7% well cost reduction last year and then additional well improvement, combined with increasing the percentage of double premium wells. And what I mean by that is a lower cost of the reserves, bringing those into the company's financials. Our maintenance capital continues to decrease, which is fantastic for us. You're right, the $32 breakeven that we provided today is actually with our commensurate with the CapEx program that we have for this year. But the double premium wells, we can't stress enough. Not only is it -- does the impact show out on very rapid payout and a high rate of return, but really by bringing those lower-cost reserves and a lower decline into the base of the company, over time, it really does start to show up an impact the full cycle returns and free cash flow generation potential of the company in the future. Doug Leggate : So where do you think those 2 numbers are today, the sustaining capital and the ex-growth breakeven? Ezra Yacob : Yes. So we didn't release a maintenance capital this earnings call due to the fact that we've started to allocate some additional capital into the Dorado play. And so it starts to get a little bit messy as you start going from oil into a BOE equivalent as we are starting to see the phenomenal results there with the Dorado play as we dedicate additional capital to it. Nevertheless, I think what we've outlined is with the 7% well cost reduction and slight improvements on the well mix year-over-year, we've continued to drive down that breakeven. And for the full cycle return, we have a slide in our deck that shows the one way that we like to present it is the price required for a 10% return on capital employed. And you can see we made a big step change last year as we drove that price down to $44. Doug Leggate : My follow-up is a capital allocation question, and it's really -- maybe it's for Tim. The free cash flow you're showing in your slide deck of north of $4 billion a year after the special could essentially wipe out the majority of your share buyback authorization. I'm just wondering why you still feel no need to offer some kind of capital return framework? Because clearly, with the transparency of that breakeven level with the duration of your inventory and so on, valuation becomes a little bit more transparent. Therefore, buybacks could perhaps be more justifiable. So I'm just curious why you've been reluctant now to go down that route? I'll leave it there. Ezra Yacob : Yes. Doug, this is Ezra again. Just to reiterate our free cash flow priorities, first, the commitment begins with the sustainable dividend growth of our regular dividend. In '21, we doubled that regular dividend. And to us, that regular dividend is really indicative of what we're trying to accomplish. It reflects the continuing increase in the go-forward capital efficiency of the company. And it's also focused on creating through-the-cycle value and free cash flow, and that's ultimately what we're trying to do. Again, going back to what we were just talking about with the investment in the double premium wells and lowering the cost base of the company, trying to take at least a small step away from the inevitable commodity price cycles of our industry. The second free cash flow priority for us is a pristine balance sheet, which obviously provides tremendous competitive advantage in a cyclical industry. And then the third, what we're talking about right now is the additional cash return in the form of specials or opportunistic repurchases. And as we talked about, last year, we demonstrated the commitment with $2.7 billion in cash return through the form of $3 per share special dividends and are regular. And then we also retired that $750 million bond early in the year. In general, what we've talked about is we're going to use our -- reserve our repurchase opportunities to be more opportunistic than programmatic. So in times one way to think is that in times of rising share or oil price, you can expect us to prefer to do special dividends. And really, the way that we think about the share repurchase is, we measure it as an investment the same as we measure any investments across our business. So we want to make sure that it competes on a returns basis. And that's why we still prefer in an environment like this to stick with the special dividend as the priority for additional cash return. Operator : Our next question today comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Scott Gruber : Just following on that line of questioning, given that your net debt negative here at the start of the year, should we think about the cash build is largely being over This is Tim. No. First of all, we are excited to have to be in a position where we are to have a cash balance going -- our net cash balance going forward. So we will continue, as I said in my opening remarks, we'll continue to build cash on the balance sheet during these high oil price scenarios and look to -- for opportunities in the countercyclical times to deploy that cash in a meaningful way in the form of more specials or stock buybacks or just opportunistic things that come along in the countercyclical environment. So the answer, again, is no, we will be -- in these high price environment, we will be building more cash on the balance sheet. Scott Gruber : Got you. I appreciate the clarification. And then congrats on the expanded export agreement. Just thinking about the broader backdrop here, there's likely another round of LNG project sanctioning along the Gulf Coast. It seems like the industry is in an advantaged position there. How aggressive EOG on entering additional agreements, thinking kind of similar terms? Do you guys foresee and expanded JKM to Henry Hub spread that you'd want to capture? Do you think that's sustainable and you want to capture that spread? Or do you kind of look at additional agreements more through traditional diversification lens? Lance Terveen : Yes, Scott. Thanks for your question. This is Lance. I think what I can really point you to is like you think about each of our operating areas and you think about our transportation positions that we have, it really puts us : one, we're in close proximity; but two, we have the capability that we can transact very quickly. So I think first, I would point you to that. And then I'd say secondly, yes, we're always interested in new opportunities. So we'll be continuing to look at that from like a business development standpoint. And it's really going to be commensurate like you heard from Billy as you talk about -- as you think about growth, our volumes. And then as we move forward, we will be looking at new opportunities, but that will be definitely commensurate with our plans on a go forward as we look at our plan. Operator : Our next question today comes from Neal Dingmann from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. The line is yours. Neal Dingmann : Maybe for you or Tim, maybe just ask one more on the shareholder return. I know most popular question. But you guys continue now to pay out over 50% of your free cash flow. And I'm just wondering on a go forward, I know there were some out there thinking you all would even have potentially a higher payout, is that something that you're targeting? I know you're not going to have the exact metrics on how you want to pay out up to a certain amount. But is that something internally you're always continuing to sort of look at paying out over 50% or 60% or something like that on a go forward, given your strong free cash flow? Ezra Yacob : Yes. This is Ezra. We continue to evaluate our cash position with respect to dividends on a quarterly basis. And what I would say is that, you're correct, we're thrilled to be in the position where we are, where we can offer to the shareholders such a competitive regular base dividend that again, I think, is our number one priority as a way to create value through the cycles. But on top of that, we are in a great position to offer continued strength of our balance sheet to support that dividend and then continue to offer cash return -- additional cash return of excess free cash flow in the form of these specials and buybacks. We don't have a specific target that we do. We stay away from providing a formula because we want to be able to have the flexibility to do the right thing at the right time to really maximize the shareholder value in a way that is protected through the cycles. Said another way, I think we've demonstrated that over the past year. We've taken the opportunity to both strengthen the balance sheet last year. And again, last year pay out a significant amount, $2.7 billion in cash returns. And we've doubled down on that basically with this first quarter announcement with the $1.75 per share cash return this quarter. And essentially, that reflects the evaluation, the positive commodity price environment that we were experiencing in and the strength of the underlying business and our confidence in it going forward. Neal Dingmann : I notice a nice bump on the NGL guide. Maybe could you talk about it -- I've seen you obviously now have a number of wells up in the sort of liquids area. Is that what's driving the growth there? Or can you could talk about sort of plans in the Marcellus side area or area, I would say, Ezra Yacob : Yes. We actually divested of our Marcellus position a couple of years ago that was in a dry gas part of the Marcellus acreage there in Pennsylvania. With respect to some of the other opportunities that we haven't really discussed publicly, that's really exploration, as you guys know. First and foremost, we're an exploration company. We're always striving to be a first mover and organically improve the quality of our inventory. So I will provide you a little bit of color on that. Domestically, we continue to explore across the U.S., our exploration program that we've talked about for the last year or so has been progressing. We finished last year drilling 12 wells across multiple opportunities, all dominantly oil-focused and we'll be slightly increasing that number this year to about 20 as we're encouraged with some of the results that we had last year. In general, though, like I said, we don't discuss the details of the exploration other than just to say that the opportunities are low-cost entry, they're oil focused, they're reservoirs that we think can exploit with our horizontal drilling and completions expertise. And this year, we look forward to doing some more delineation and appraisal drilling. And as we've said in the past, the goal of our exploration program is not just to find oil or find reserves. It's really to add to the quality of our inventory from a lower finding cost and higher returns perspective. And so it takes time to be able to evaluate that we can actually discover these opportunities and bring them into the mix where they're really going to help lower the cost base of the company and be a significant contributor to our portfolio going forward. Neal Dingmann : And I guess just a follow-up on that. As far as the NGL guide going up, that's simply a function of the fact that we have opportunity to make an election as to how much we recover or reject going forward on several of our processing contracts -- and with the strength of much of the NGL pricing, we're simply assuming we'll be in recovery mode more than rejection mode in several of those contracts this year. Operator : Our next question today comes from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. The line is yours. Scott Hanold : And maybe just since you talked a little bit about the exploration opportunities in the U.S. Can you give us a sense of how you think about international exploration opportunities? I know you all were doing some work in Oman in offshore Australia. Is there any update there? And how do you think about international versus onshore or U.S. opportunities? Ezra Yacob : Yes. Scott, in general, as we've talked about, the international opportunities have -- they have a higher hurdle to really be considered additive to the quality of our inventory simply because we need to have access to services there. We need to have access to contracts, and we need to find the subsurface geology that actually makes it, not just competitive, but really superior to much of what we're drilling here. In Australia, to start with that one, we still have that opportunity. We plan -- we're in the permitting phase currently, and we plan to initiate drilling in that one early next year. And then in Oman, we did announce, as you recall, we had a low cost of entry into Oman. It included a 2-well commitment. And during the second half of '21, we drilled those 2 exploratory wells, one of which was a short horizontal. We completed that horizontal, made a natural gas discovery there. But ultimately, as I was just saying the prospect, we decided is not going to compete with our existing portfolio. So we won't be moving forward with that project. In general, we do feel encouraged with the international opportunities out there because we see really kind of a lack of exploration competition out there. And we see that many times, national oil companies or ministries, the owners of those lands have really started to realize that they can't rely on traditional conventional term contracts to be able to get some unconventional type prospects drilled. And so we're seeing a little bit more flexibility on the negotiation side, which gives us some encouragement. Scott Hanold : And I'm going to hit on the shareholder returns too because obviously, you all are in a very enviable position. But Ezra and Tim, you guys talk about being opportunistic and countercyclical ways with your balance sheet then -- during the fourth quarter, I guess, post things given there was a little bit of a disconnect there. Your stock was a lot lower than it is today. Why not take that opportunity then to buy back stock? Can you -- so just trying to frame for us like when you think the right opportunities to buy back stock are. Ezra Yacob : Yes. In general, Scott, we didn't see that as one of the opportunities that we're looking for there in the fourth quarter. When we talk about the significant dislocation, we're talking about something more so than that. Like I said, we consider share repurchase in the same way that we do any investment decision. It's how does it create the most long-term shareholder value. And we're in a cyclical industry, and that's why we prefer to use it opportunistically with a significant opportunity. The challenge, of course, is we recognize that being in a position to execute during the market dislocation is a challenging thing to do. However, we feel with the strength of our balance sheet and the low cash operating cost that we have, we'll be well positioned when we see the opportunity. Operator : Our next question today comes from Leo Mariani from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. The line is yours. Leo Mariani : I wanted to see if there's any update on the PRB. Certainly noticed in the slide deck that activity there is going to be down a little bit in terms of a few less wells in '22 versus what you did in '21. So perhaps you could kind of speak to how well costs have trended and kind of where that opportunity is on your list amongst the different plays? Clearly, you described a significant increase in Delaware activity this year. So how does the PRB rank? Jeffrey Leitzell : Leo, this is Jeff Leitzell. The PRB, we're really excited about where it's going. In 2021, we had a record year, both from a well performance and an economic standpoint. Last year, our team, they continue to really delineate our core areas. They completed about 50 wells and half of those exceeded our double premium threshold. So we're really encouraged by that. On top of that, we also brought on multiple record wells in the basin, both in the Niobrara and the Mowry formations, all doing this while reducing our cost year-over-year by about 10%. So the one thing that we really look at with the Powder River Basin is it's a little bit more geologically complex compared to our other basins. So it's really important that we operate at the right pace, and we don't outrun our learnings. So looking forward kind of to 2022, we plan on maintaining a similar amount of activity and as our team there really high grades our acreage, refines our well spacing and strategically build out our infrastructure, we really expect the Powder River Basin asset to be able to increase activity in 2023 and beyond. Leo Mariani : And then if I can just take another crack at the kind of exploration. So I certainly noticed that you guys are spending about by numbers of right around $100 million more on some of these U.S. plays here in '22, and you clearly talked about drilling more wells. I guess a common question I hear from investors out there is it's been a number of years since EOG has kind of announced the strategy, and I guess we'd kind of get to see a new significant U.S. oil play for the company. I know these things are hard to predict, but if I had to just kind of look at a high-level time line. I mean, do you think that's likely in '22 or maybe '23? I mean anything you can kind of say from a high level to get people some assurance that maybe these are progressing? Ezra Yacob : Yes. Leo, what I'd say is it's just really hard to predict, and I'd hate to commit to something to lead you down the wrong path. I might point to historically, we did some early drilling in the Powder River Basin, and it was a number of years before we felt comfortable We gotten that to a point where we want to talk about it publicly in a big way. And then the same with Dorado. I know there was a lot of speculation as to our Austin Chalk exploration program for a number of years. And as you can see, we waited until we had some long-term production and felt confident as to what we had there before we started really talking about it publicly. The current exploration program was definitely slowed down, even maybe a little bit more than we anticipated during the pandemic. It was just a little more difficult even to get leasing done and things of that nature. As we talked about in 2021, the plays coming out of the pandemic had really started to move it kind of various paces or various rates. Some of the wells last year that we drilled were the initial wells in these plays. In other prospects, some of the wells, we're really testing a little more delineation, repeatability, more appraisal. Because again, like I said, almost more than an exploration program, what we're trying to find is not just oil. That's not necessarily the most difficult thing anymore. It's really, as you guys can appreciate, trying to find low-cost barrels, barrels that are additive to what not only we have already discovered but what the industry has really discovered, what the world wants is access to lower-cost barrels, and that's what we're searching for. And so it takes a little bit longer to be able to really get the appraisal on these and make sure that these opportunities are really going to be additive, again, to the quality of our inventory. Operator : The next question today comes from Jeannie Wai from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeannie Wai : Our first question is maybe just back to the double premium. You added 700 new net double premium locations in 2021. And were these additions spread out across your plays? Or are they concentrated in maybe one or two of them? And where do you see the most runway for future conversions? Kenneth Boedeker : Yes. Jeanine, thanks for the question. This is Ken. We added double premium locations over a number of our active premium plays, really in line with where we drilled our wells last year, mainly in the Permian and the Eagle Ford. And this is really just an example of our culture where we're working to get better, continuing to lower well costs while focusing on increasing the recovery is what leads to significant increases in returns and really allows us to convert wells to premium and double premium through time. And our goal is to always replace at least as many double premium locations as we drill every year. Jeannie Wai : Maybe our second question, maybe 1 for Tim or Ezra. In the past, I think if memory serves me correctly, I think you've commented that after you pay off the 2023 notes that you don't really have a desire to pay down any further debt. I just wanted to check in if that was still the thinking? And I think we're just really looking for a little bit more color on how you decided that $1 per share for the special this time around was the optimal level? Tim Driggers : Yes. This is Tim. No, we have not announced any intention of paying off more bonds as they become due. We'll continue to evaluate that as we go forward, but we -- that did not figure into the dollar was a way of giving back meaningful amount of cash to the shareholders in this period. And as we said, that's a backward-looking thing, not a forward-looking thing. Operator : Our final question today comes from Neil Mehta from Golman Sachs. Please go ahead. The line is yours. Neil Mehta : I know EOG has developed some more internal macro forecasting capability. And I'd just be curious on your views on U.S. shale production in the United States. How are you guys thinking about it entry to exit U.S. oil growth? And talk about the moving pieces ranging from what you're seeing from your competitors in the private market to services constraints such as pressure pumping, your thoughts on U.S. growth would be valuable. Ezra Yacob : Yes. Neil, I'll add a bit of an overview, and then maybe I'll hand it off to Billy for some more details for you on the activity side. But in general, when we think about the growth forecasts that are out there and have been publicly discussed, we're probably a bit more on the lower end in general on the crude and condensate side. And the reason for that is I think you're seeing commitment from the North American E&P space to remain disciplined. And then you couple that with some of the inflationary and supply chain pressures. And we think the U.S. is definitely going to face some headwinds in growth on this year. And I think Billy can provide a bit more details on it. Lloyd Helms : Yes. Neil, this is Billy. I'm sure you've heard the same comments from many of our peers about the supply chain constraints in the industry is seeing across all the sectors, certainly on the drilling rig side, there's certainly most of the active super-spec rigs are being -- are deployed and active today. There's not a lot of new pieces of equipment that can come into the market. The same is true on the frac side of the business, most of the good equipment is already under employment today. And then bringing in new fleets, both on the drilling side and on the frac side, is challenged also from the standpoint of attracting labor to the market. So there's a lot of headwinds to try to -- for the industry to try to ramp up activity and grow production this year. So it will be a probably viewed as maybe a transition year also in that light. And hopefully, the industry can strengthen and get better on a go-forward basis. But this year is going to be a challenging year from that side. Neil Mehta : And then the follow-up is around natural gas, both U.S. and global. A lot of moving pieces, obviously, right now from a geopolitical standpoint. But the most of the industry has been of a lower-for-longer U.S. natural gas view. Do you see that evolving as we have more LNG linkage into the global market? If you think about global gas, especially in light of your announcement with do you see a structural change in this market until Qatar supply comes on mid decade? Ezra Yacob : Yes. Neil, this is Ezra. In general, what I would say is the U.S. has discovered a very vast supply of natural gas, and it's important that we get that gas offshore and into the global market for some of the reasons that you talked about now, not only geopolitical, but just developing nations, so on and so forth. And that's one of the reasons where we're so glad to partner and continue to take out some of our LNG. For us, the way we think about the natural gas globally is really it's going to be a cost of supply. And we say that we want to be the low-cost producer, and that might sound like we're talking about oil dominantly, but that goes for gas as well. And it's one reason we're very excited about our Dorado prospect. We think it competes in North America is basically the lowest cost of supply, especially because of its geographic location, close to so many marketing centers, including the Gulf Coast. So we're very excited and very fortunate to have it. And I think the U.S. is going to continue to be, in the long term, a significant player in the global gas supply. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Q&A session. So I'll now hand the call back to Mr. Yacob. Ezra Yacob : Yes. We want to thank everyone for participating on the call this morning, and we want to thank our shareholders for their support. As we said, EOG had an outstanding performance in 2021, and we're poised for an up great year in 2022. And it really comes down to our employees. Our employees are the keys to our success, and it's why I'm convinced are to being one of the lowest cost, highest return and lowest emissions energy suppliers that can play a significant role in the long-term future of energy. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir. Tim Driggers : Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG\u2019s SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliations schedules for these non-GAAP measures can be found on the EOG\u2019s website. This conference call also include estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC\u2019s reserve reporting guidelines. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chief Executive Officer; Billy Helms, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration & Production; Jeff Leitzell, EVP, Exploration & Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor & Public Relations. Here\u2019s Ezra. Ezra Yacob : Thanks Tim. Good morning, everyone. EOG\u2019s cash return strategy demonstrates our commitment to deliver long-term shareholder value. Yesterday, we declared a second special dividend for the year of $1.80 per share following last quarter\u2019s $1 per share. Combined with our peer-leading annualized regular dividend of $3 per share year-to-date, we have announced $3.4 billion in cash return to shareholders in 2022. EOG has a strong history of cash return. Since we began trading as an independent company in 1999, we have delivered a sustainable growing regular dividend. It has never been cut or suspended and its 23-year compound annual growth rate is 22%. Since the transition to premium drilling in 2016, our dividend compound annual growth rate has been even higher at 28% including doubling our dividend last year. Today, our regular dividend not only leads our E&P peer group. It is more than competitive across all sectors of the market. More recently, we have supplemented our regular dividend with significant special dividends, reflecting our commitment to both capital discipline and returning cash to shareholders. While we are proud of our cash return track record, we acknowledge shareholders desire for more transparency and predictability. To provide both, we recently formalized and yesterday announced our cash return commitment of returning a minimum of 60% of annual free cash flow. Going forward, our intention is to evaluate and pay the regular dividend and consider options for additional cash return every quarter. The addition of quantitative guidance to our cash return framework reflects our confidence in our business. The pandemic driven volatility in the oil and gas market is stabilizing. However, the macro environment continues to evolve with the war in Ukraine and other geopolitical events. We have proven to ourselves over the last several years that our business is resilient through the cycle, including unprecedented shocks to the industry. Credit for EOG\u2019s resilience for the steady improvement in our ability to generate free cash flow in any environment and the ability to make this free cash flow commitment to our shareholders goes to our employees who embrace our premium return hurdle rate six years ago, which requires that all investments are in a minimum of 30% direct after tax rate of return using a $40 flat oil and $2.50 flat natural gas price. Last year, we doubled the minimum return to 60%, both the premium and now double premium hurdle rates have positioned the company to have an outstanding year in 2022. In spite of the ongoing inflationary and supply chain issues facing our industry, our employees outperformed during the first quarter and are positioned to deliver on our annual capital and volumes plan. We have decades of low cost, high return inventory that support the consistent financial performance that our shareholders have come to expect and that drives long-term value. Our inventory spans multiple assets across oil, combo and dry natural gas basins throughout the country, which enables us to pursue the highest net backs by diversifying both our investment and sales market options. We also continue to explore. A year and a half ago, we announced Dorado a premium dry natural gas play, where we\u2019ve captured 21 Tcf of resource potential net to EOG. In a moment, Ken will update you on the progress we\u2019ve made on well performance and well costs and what we believe is the lowest cost and lowest emission source of natural gas onshore U.S. Our organic exploration program has grown our premium inventory by more than 3.5 times since the premium metric was introduced in 2016. So our exploration program isn\u2019t focused on adding more. We are looking for better inventory. New plays like Dorado and the potential we see in our current exploration pipeline gives us confidence we will continue to grow and improve our double premium inventory in the future as we have done in the past. While we have earmarked and committed to return a minimum of 60% of annual free cash flow, our longstanding framework and priorities for total free cash flow are unchanged, a sustainable growing regular dividend, a pristine balance sheet, additional cash return to shareholders through special dividends and opportunistic stock buybacks and low cost property bolt-ons. Sustaining and growing the regular dividend remains our highest priority and reflects our confidence in the long-term performance of the company. A pristine balance sheet is a strategic advantage functioning as a shock absorber that also provides the flexibility to exercise a buyback when the opportunity arises and to take advantage of other counter cyclical investments. Additional cash returns through special dividends and buybacks complement our other priorities and together with our free cash minimum return guidance support our goal to create significant long-term shareholder value. Now, here\u2019s Tim to review our financial position. Tim Driggers : Thanks, Ezra. Our ability to refine our longstanding cash return framework by providing quantitative guidance is made possible by EOG\u2019s outstanding operational and financial performance. In the first quarter, EOG earned $2.3 billion after adjusting items or $4 per share. We generated $2.3 billion of free cash flow. Capital expenditures of $1 billion were near the low end of the guidance range, while production volumes and total per unit cash operating costs finished better than targets. Our confidence is further bolstered because we finished the quarter in an incredibly strong financial position. Total debt on March 31 was $5.1 billion. This includes the current portion of debt of $1.25 billion, reflecting the bond matures in March 2023, that we intend to pay off with cash on hand. Cash on March 31 was $4 billion for a net debt of $1.1 billion. This yield\u2019s a debt to total capitalization ratio of 4.8%. The $4 billion cash balance excludes $2.4 billion of collateral for hedges held by our counterparties. The amount of collateral fluctuates with oil and natural gas prices. These short-term timing differences in cash flows are not considered in our calculation of free cash flow and do not influence our decision on the timing or amount of cash return to shareholders. To that end, EOG has declared special dividends so far this year totaling $2.80 per share on top of the regular dividend of $3 per share on an annual basis, totaling $3.4 billion. Our objective in establishing our cash return guidance was to make it simple, yet dynamic so that it is easily communicated and understood while remaining suitable under a range of commodity price scenarios. The actual amount of cash return each year is a product of our long standing free cash flow priorities. These have not changed. The size of our regular dividend is now the largest of our E&P peers and the strength of our balance sheet supports our ability to return a large portion of free cash flow back to shareholders going forward under a range of scenarios. The $1.80 special dividend declared yesterday, along with $0.75 regular quarterly dividend demonstrate significant progress toward our commitment to returning at least 60% of our 2022 free cash flow to our shareholders. Subject to commodity prices, the amount of free cash flow available and the Board\u2019s discretion, our intention is to return cash through special dividends or stock buybacks on a quarterly basis going forward. Here\u2019s Billy. Billy Helms : Thanks, Tim. We\u2019ve had a great start to the year. Our first quarter volume, capital expenditure and total per unit cash operating cost performance exceeded our forecasted targets. We\u2019re also pleased with our progress to-date, offsetting inflation and managing well cost. Our drilling teams continue to reduce drilling days and generate consistent performance improvements. Use of self-sourced downhole tools as well as minimizing downtime and mud losses remain areas of focus to improve performance. For example, drilling times in our Eagle Ford oil play continue to improve, decreasing 28% in the last five years. The average well is now drilled in less than five days. On the completion side, we have increased the amount of treated lateral per day by about 10% over the last year, as we further deploy the super zipper technique. We are now using this technique on more than half of the wells completed in the company and expect to increase its use further as we progress through the year. In addition, our self-sourced sand program is providing a tremendous advantage that we expect to further offset additional inflation throughout the year. When we establish our plan at the beginning of the year, we knew the unusually tight supply constraints initially sparked by the economic recovery from the pandemic would present a unique challenge. Taking these headwinds into account, this year\u2019s plan was devised with known efficiency improvements that would maintain well cost flat with last year. While we have since seen increased steel and fuel prices directly associated with the war in Ukraine, we are confident we can still deliver on the CapEx and volume targets in our original plan. Rather than accept inflation as a given, our employees remain proactive. We have a track record of lowering cost and developing efficiencies through periods of economic expansion and other drivers of inflation. Our operating teams are ever more diligent in their quest to identify new areas of performance enhancements that will lower well cost. EOG\u2019s advantage lies with our people and our culture. Today\u2019s challenges are met with innovation and value creation in the field through our multi-basin decentralized approach. This period of inflationary fuel prices is a primary driver of the 2% increase in our full year per unit cash operating costs versus our previous guidance. However, higher commodity prices also present an opportune time to enhance our workover program, which will be reflected in LOE expense. These additional workovers bring on low cost production that pay out within weeks and increase the long-term performance of our assets. All in all, we\u2019re thoughtfully managing our assets to offset a small effect from inflation. While we have flexibility to adjust our plan in any given year to respond to unique or extreme marketing conditions such as the pandemic in 2020, our capital plan is thoughtfully planned across all our assets to support the pace of operations that is optimal for each individual asset to continue to improve. We believe we have the best people, assets, and plan to mitigate any headwinds and continue to improve the company for the long term. Here\u2019s Ken to discuss the incredible improvements we made in our premium gas play, Dorado. Ken Boedeker : Thanks, Billy. A year and a half ago, we announced a major new natural gas discovery in South Texas. We named Dorado. It\u2019s a dry gas play with 21 Tcf of resource potential net EOG across stacked pays in the Austin Chalk and Eagle Ford formations. Our break even cost in Dorado is less than $1.25 per Mcf, which we believe represents the lowest cost of supply of natural gas in the United States. Dorado was the most recent double premium play to emerge from our organic exploration program. We began technical work on Dorado back in 2016, captured a large acreage position in the core of the play as a first mover during 2017 and 2018 and drill test wells in late 2018 and 2019. After pausing during the downturn in 2020, we moved Dorado into active development last year and completed 11 net wells. This year, we anticipate completing 30 net wells, nearly tripling activity. Since last year, we have doubled our production rate out of Dorado producing 140 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter of 2022. We are leveraging our proprietary knowledge built from prior plays to move quickly down the cost curve as we increase activity at a pace that allows us to incorporate learnings and savings. We completed seven net wells during the first quarter of 2022, while keeping well cost flat compared to similar designs in the first quarter of last year successfully offsetting inflation. Since our first well was drilled in 2018, we have reduced well cost over 35% and our approaching our target well cost faster than we anticipated. In addition, well performance is improving. Productivity from recent wells is significantly beating our initial forecast, refined completion techniques, and a focus on targeting have increased our performance projections on a per foot basis. This year, we have also moved to longer lateral switch combined with the improvements to per foot productivity have resulted in an 80% higher two-year cumulative production volume that our 2018 wells compounding our capital efficiency. Our preliminary plan for the play was to focus initial development on the Austin Chalk formation, and then follow that with development of the Eagle Ford. So it would benefit from well cost reductions as well as water and gas gathering infrastructure installed for the Austin Chalk. With the dramatic improvements to our Eagle Ford formation well results, we now expect to co-develop it with the Austin Chalk, which will provide additional opportunities to lower costs through scale and simultaneous operations. As a dry gas play in close proximity to multiple markets, we expect Dorado\u2019s gas will have a lower emissions footprint compared to other onshore gas supplies in the U.S. In addition, we continue to leverage company-wide expertise to build out an operationally efficient and low emissions field. As we expand development of Dorado into a core asset, it will contribute to lowering EOG\u2019s companywide emissions intensity rate. Combined with EOG\u2019s low operating costs and advantaged market position located close to several major sales hubs in South Texas, including access to pipelines to Mexico and several LNG export terminals, Dorado is in an ideal position to supply low cost, low emissions natural gas into markets with long-term growth potential. Now next up is Ezra for concluding remarks. Ezra Yacob : Thanks Ken. I\u2019d like to note the following important takeaways from the call today. First, formalizing our cash return strategy demonstrates our commitment to our free cash flow priorities that along with high return discipline reinvestment offers significant long-term shareholder value. Second, EOG is realizing another tremendous year of improvement. We are set to deliver outstanding returns while demonstrating capital discipline within an inflationary environment, delivering on both volumes and capital as announced at the beginning of 2022. Third, our most recent organic exploration announcement Dorado has positioned us with over 20 Tcf of low cost natural gas with access to multiple markets. Our progress in Dorado is on pace to make this North America\u2019s lowest cost of supply. Thanks for listening. Now, we\u2019ll go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug, your line is open. Doug Leggate : Well, thank you. Good morning, everybody. And Ezra I think I speak for everybody in saying we\u2019re delighted to see the framework you\u2019ve introduced for cash returns. I do have a question around this, however, and it is \u2013 I\u2019m just curious what\u2019s changed to move you in that direction? And I wonder if I could ask you to \u2013 you\u2019re obviously talking about percentage in free cash flow. So I wonder if you could frame some similar parameters around how you think about reinvestment rates or the planning assumptions that go around that so we can get some kind of idea as to what free cash flow ultimately looks like versus the level of spending if you see my point. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Doug. I sure do. So let me start with the \u2013 what is now, why now, and simply we feel that this is the right time for our business to come out with the additional guidance. We\u2019ve got the regular dividend increase to be competitive with the broad market. We\u2019ve got the balance sheets in a very strong position. And we\u2019re basically emerging stronger from the downturn and confident that we can deliver this minimum amount of cash return going forward. It\u2019s consistent with our long-term free cash flow priorities. So it\u2019s not really a change in strategy. In fact, in 2021, we returned about 49% of free cash flow and we paid off a $750 million bond. So when you combine those that was about 60%. And so it\u2019s a range internally we\u2019ve discussed and the announcement really just provides a bit of transparency. Now on the second part of your question with regards to how do you think about, how are we thinking about the reinvestment growth and to get to free cash flow. One thing, one reason we have given this guidance as a minimum of 60% return on free cash flow is because it\u2019s a guide that can be consistent and long term in nature through the cycle, like how we manage the business basing the guide off of a free cash flow, puts us in what we feel is the best overall position to create shareholder value through the cycle. So nothing\u2019s really changed in the reinvestment strategy. It\u2019s first, always based on returns and our ability to get better each year. There\u2019s \u2013 as we\u2019ve said in the past, there\u2019s no reason to invest in growth if you\u2019re not generating high returns and you\u2019re not doing it with an ability to improve the underlying business year after year. And what that means is, not chasing free cash flow, just because of high prices, if you\u2019re investing in something that\u2019s eroding the business long term. So you can take today, for example we could increase activity today into these high prices, but in the inflationary environment that\u2019s going to erode our capital efficiency. And then the second piece that we\u2019ve talked about as far as reinvestment our growth is based on the macro environment and market fundamentals. Does the market really need the barrels? What\u2019s supporting the global supply and demand fundamentals? Ultimately, investing in premium and double premium as you know, has made a somewhat price agnostic basing those decisions on $40 oil and 2.50 natural gas. And so it\u2019s really the capital discipline comes down to what can we do? And are we investing in a pace where each of our assets can get better year after year and ultimately improve the overall returns and company profile? Doug Leggate : I appreciate the answer, Ezra. As I said, we all welcome by what you\u2019ve done. So thank you for that. My follow-up is hopefully a quick one. So some years ago, you guys pivoted away from natural gas, Dorado, obviously, the exception today. But you also took a light off of a lot of your legacy gas assets. The world has obviously changed. So I\u2019m just wondering within the company, is there any effort or I guess, initiative to pivot back to some of those legacies \u2013 some of the legacy gas assets that are obviously still in your portfolio in light of what\u2019s going on as it relates to LNG expansion longer-term. I leave it there. Thank you. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Doug. As you said, the world\u2019s changed a lot and the company\u2019s changed quite a bit. The biggest thing for us is that introduction of the premium and now double premium reinvestment hurdle rates. So all of our gas assets now are judged and it\u2019s $2.50, flat natural gas price for the life of the well, and that really high grades our reinvestment opportunities into any of our assets, but especially the natural gas ones as we\u2019re talking about right now. Ultimately what we see with Dorado is that we\u2019ve captured a very significant resource geographically in the best spot. We think onshore U.S. with access to multiple markets. And we\u2019re very excited about being able to focus in on really that asset that we have. We think it\u2019s going to be the premier asset in North American natural gas. Doug Leggate : [Crushing] (ph) for sure. Thanks for taking my question. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles, your line is open. Charles Meade : Good morning, Ezra, and to the whole EOG team there. Ezra, kind of picking up on the point you just made. I\u2019m curious does - I get that you evaluate all your projects at 40 and 2.50, and that services the best oil projects and best gas projects. But is there any concern or discussion inside EOG that maybe evaluating projects that something so far below the strip is actually giving you a suboptimal relative ranking across oil and gas assets? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Charles. The way we look at it is we\u2019ve been fortunate. We\u2019ve been in unconventional North American exploration here for nearly two decades honestly, and what that\u2019s allowed us to do is put together a multi basin portfolio of what we think is really the deepest and highest quality asset inventory. When we switched to premium, it was really taking a long-term look at that $40 price, $2.50 natural gas price to not only help the immediate returns, the rate of return, the IRRs upfront, but really thinking about longer term through the cycles. What does it mean to really build a company where based on a commodity price, you can still be successful and create value through the cycles. Ratcheting that up to double premium in 2020 was really a reflection of our ability to have grown our premium inventory three and a half times through organic exploration since 2016. So actually I think the focus on double premium drilling and that reinvestment hurdle rate actually provides us with an optimal way to rank our assets. Charles Meade : Okay, thank you for that insight. And perhaps going back to Dorado, I caught during the prepared comments that I think that the two-year cum is 80% higher than your 2018 case and part of that is longer laterals. And I think that the base was the kind the 2018 case was 9,000 foot lateral. So is, am I making, am I in the right ballpark to thinking that if 80% higher, two year cum, some of that\u2019s longer laterals, so we\u2019re looking at maybe 40% or 50% higher productivity per lateral foot in the Dorado play versus the earlier case? Ken Boedeker : Yes, Charles. This is Ken. We haven\u2019t really given out a number on how much higher the productivity is. If we look back to those 2018 wells, they were shorter laterals in the 6,000 to 7,000 foot range. We\u2019ve now have some extended laterals even past our original 9,000 foot range that we thought we\u2019d get. And those things both the improved performance and the lower cost have really driven that finding cost down to almost the $0.40 target that we\u2019re showing on Slide 11 there. Charles Meade : Yes. But no, you don\u2019t care to offer any comments on the productivity per lateral foot, I guess, and that\u2019s fine. Thank you. Ken Boedeker : I guess Charles, just what I would say is, it is \u2013 our wells are beating our type curves that we have and those type curves do have a fairly low decline over the first several months of production. So we are seeing them beating our type curves. And if you look at it, we\u2019ve really only drilled 30 of our 1,250 wells in that place. So we\u2019re continuing to learn. Charles Meade : Thank you, Ken. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Arun Jayaram : Yes. Good morning. My first question is just on the supply chain, you guys are holding the line on CapEx. A number of your peers have raised CapEx expectations. So I was wondering if you could comment what\u2019s unique about the way you\u2019re managing the supply chain to give you confidence on delivering the $4.5 billion CapEx budget, and do some of these supply chain headwinds we\u2019re seeing within the industry. How does that influence your thoughts about 2023 given shortages of OFS equipment labor and just broader \u2013 just challenges on things like OCTG? Billy Helms : Yes, Arun. This is Billy. Let me start by providing maybe an overview of how we\u2019re managing the year\u2019s capital program. Then I\u2019d like to get Jeff to add some color and then I\u2019ll circle back to 2023. Let me first start by saying that we kind of look at each year the same way. As you know, we would \u2013 I would tend to bucket this in maybe three or four different areas. One, we self source a lot of materials that insulates this from a lot of the supply chain issues, we also do a lot of innovation in efficiency gains. The third bucket might be the pace of the adoption of these new efficiencies across the company. And then may be finally flexibility with our multi-basin approach. So just to elaborate on that a little bit more, at the beginning of the year, we constructed our plant, certainly recognizing the inflation we saw from the recovery of post-COVID. And we were confident in looking at that, we could offset inflation and maintain flat well cost. What we didn\u2019t anticipate was the war in Ukraine and that additional pressure and increased inflation we saw in commodities such as fuel and steel, but we\u2019re still working to offset this additional inflation through our efficiencies and new innovations. These improvements in efficiency gains are certainly happening, largely in the areas where we have the most activities such as Delaware basin and Eagle Ford. But I would also say that the pace of the adoption of these new technologies, the rapid adoption of the super zipper technology across the company is happening faster than we expected. So we also have the advantage of being in multiple basins. So that gives us a lot of flexibility to shift activity between areas. So we\u2019re very comfortable that we can maintain our plan, delivering our original volumes and within our stated CapEx goals, we laid out the start of the year. So with that, maybe I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff to give you some more details. Jeff Leitzell : Yes, good morning, Arun. This is Jeff Leitzell. So as Billy stated, our ability to counter these inflationary pressures and some of the supply chain constraints that you talked about, it\u2019s really just a huge credit to our team\u2019s operational execution, their innovative culture and really continuing to improve on the efficiencies. So just to give you a little bit of color and some examples, start off with our drilling operations, our teams continue to increase their efficiencies and that\u2019s primarily with EOG\u2019s in-house motor program and our proprietary bit cutter development, which we can kind of design both of these uniquely around all the formations we drill in each of our plays. And our Eagle Ford operations, they\u2019re just a perfect example of this. We\u2019ve increased the drilled footage per day by over 17% this year. And this is one of our more mature plays that we\u2019ve been drilling in for 13 years. So really to EOG, no matter how far along we are in development, there\u2019s always improvements that can be made. And then on the same topic there with the Eagle Ford, they\u2019ve just done an outstanding job of reducing their drilling fluid costs also, even as diesel prices have risen and that\u2019s primary base in those fluids. We\u2019ve done this by optimizing the density and the additives and the drilling fluid in each area, really to try to reduce those fluid losses, which has resulted in a per barrel savings of about 20% so far in 2022. And then just a couple more basic examples in completions, our field team, they continue to see really good improvements there and they\u2019ve increased their overall completed lateral per foot per day by 10% compared to 2021 for the total company. And as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, one of the main drivers in this is really our continued implementation of super zipper operations. So we talked about last year, we were about a third of our activity with super zipper and this year we had a goal of trying to get to 60%. And we\u2019re just about there right now. So this is really significant because pretty much every additional well that we super zipper, we realize the savings of up to $300,000 per well or that equates to about 5% of the total well cost. So another kind of new process on the innovation side that we\u2019ve been implementing and testing is something called continuous frac pumping operations. So just a little bit of a rundown, typically in any completion operations, you have some unplanned maintenance and in order to be proactive, our field teams have started planning some of that scheduled maintenance periods of about three to four hours every three days. And what this has helped us do is really minimize any of that unplanned maintenance and really greatly \u2013 increase our overall efficiencies. So in the past quarter, really primarily in the Eagle Ford, we\u2019ve started some testing in the Delaware basin, but we\u2019ve been able to increase our completed lateral per foot per day by roughly 30%. So that\u2019s really just a huge time in cost savings there. And what we plan on doing is we optimize this process, we\u2019ll continue to roll it out to all of our operating areas. And then lastly more on the supply chain and material side of things, I just wanted to touch on a couple of our savings from the water and the sand cost side of things. In the Delaware basin, our team continues to reduce their water costs by optimizing the reuse process, which right now is approximately 90% of all their sourced water. And they\u2019re really doing this just through increasing the automation of all of our infrastructure and reducing the overall treatment cost per barrel, which we realized about a 9% reduction in each barrel of reuse water for 2022. And this is pretty significant, not just for CapEx, but also on the operating expense because every barrel we\u2019re allowed to reuse, is one less that we have to dispose of. And then finally here, over on the sand logistics side, EOG, we\u2019ve been in the sand business in self sourcing for about 15 years now. And we continue to reduce those costs across the company. For example, out in the Delaware basin, we continue to advance our abilities to get that sand closer to the wellhead and ultimately reduce the amount of trucking needed. And plans are, we\u2019re going to open up a second plant in the second half of next year. And we really anticipate to see some pretty good savings from Q1 through the rest of the year of about 20% per pound. So these are just a few of the many examples of how our operations teams just performing and really giving us great confidence that we\u2019ll be able to counter a lot of these inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints through 2022. And as Billy will talk about here 2023. Billy Helms : Yes, Arun, just to summarize maybe I know that\u2019s a lot of detail for you but obviously, we\u2019re very proud of the efforts of our employees to continue to fight against the rising well cost in this period of inflation. As we move into 2023, it\u2019s really early to talk about specifics about next year, but let me just kind of give you an overall impression of how we think about going into any year. Certainly we have a long history of managing through inflation to maintain or lower well cost that gives us confidence to be able to meet our goals. And we have two fundamental things that we think about. One is our contracting strategy and how we approach that is for example, this year is just a reminder. We have about 50% of our well cost secured with contracts, with service providers that provide about 90% of our drilling fleet. And about 60% of our frac fleet locked up under existing contracts. Not all of those service contracts are set to expire at the end of this year. So we try to stagger those as we go through a year to make sure that we have some continuity going into the preceding year. And then the lastly would be, as Jeff mentioned there, innovation and efficiency improvements. So we are already confident. We\u2019re seeing ideas that we can continue to push and explore to continue to reduce cost and offset inflation going into next year. So we\u2019re always chasing those kind of things. I know that\u2019s a lot of color, but it\u2019s certainly something that we\u2019re very proud of our employees and their efforts, and just want to make sure you fully understand it. Arun Jayaram : Yes, appreciate the detail, Billy. My follow up is \u2013 maybe for Ezra or Tim, you guys have now committed to a 60% minimum return of free cash flow kind of framework. I wanted to get your thoughts on the other 40% bucket and what the priorities are between the balance sheet additional cash return and the bolt-ons. I know last quarter, Tim did message EOG\u2019s intention to build more cash on the balance sheet for countercyclical opportunities at other points in the cycle. So I wanted to \u2013 if you could give us some updated thoughts on that? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Arun. This is Ezra. I can start right there with where you left off, pardon me, let me say that. We\u2019re just thrilled to be in a unique position here to be able to strengthen the balance sheet and return $2.4 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2022. But ultimately, with the remaining 40%, it comes back to the fact that we\u2019re committed to delivering on our free cash flow priorities and doing the right thing at the right time to maximize long-term shareholder value. And it does include that balance sheet. And some of the things with the balance sheet we\u2019ve discussed in the past is, to have cash available just for running the business for operations to have cash for the small bolt-on acquisitions. As you mentioned to have cash available for the $5 billion stock repurchase authorization, which we\u2019ve said, we prefer to look at that as an opportunistic repurchase rather than something more programmatic. And then the last thing with regards to our balance sheet and cash on hand would also be our commitment there to retiring a bond, a $1.2 billion bond that\u2019s coming due here in the first quarter of 2023. So really, as we started off with the guide of returning a minimum of 60% of free cash flow, it\u2019s really not a change in strategy by any means. It\u2019s just a to provide a little more transparency a little more clarity, we\u2019ve heard some of our shareholders who have asked for a bit more transparency and clarity on the cash returns, and that\u2019s really what the change in messaging is, but our strategy remains very consistent. Arun Jayaram : Great. Thanks, Ezra. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine, your line is open. Jeanine Wai : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. Our first question, maybe if we can just hit back to Dorado, nice update on that. In the slides, you highlight potential export markets. Can you talk about how much midstream capacity EOG has currently or maybe what you see down the line in order to get Dorado gas to those sales points? Lance Terveen : Yes. Jeanine, good morning. This is Lance. Yes. As you think about Dorado and takeaway there, we\u2019re very well connected. I mean you can see that in Slide 11. Obviously, you can see the proximity to market. But as we talk about capacity, yes, we have sufficient capacity there, plenty of running room as we look forward and just really want to highlight too, as you think about the proximity to those markets especially the demand growth that\u2019s expected to see in the potential that\u2019s equally important. What we\u2019re excited about is you think about the proximity, less than a 100 miles to get to the Agua Dulce market. And then the connectivity that we have even to get up into the [indiscernible] Houston Ship Channel market. And as you look forward on over the next five years, you have the potential to see an additional potential of like 5 Bcf a day of new demand growth. So the proximity, the connectivity that we have, and obviously as you\u2019ve seen as evidence to our other plays, as we think about capacity, we\u2019re always very forward-looking and making sure that we have enough ongoing capacity as we think about our program. Jeanine Wai : Okay, great. Thank you. And then maybe just following-up on Arun\u2019s question. Ezra, we appreciate all the details you just provided about the cash build up there. And I guess just generally speaking, and I know it\u2019s never the simple about back solving to a cash number, but is net cash or is that like a suboptimal place for the business or would you be perfectly fine with the balance sheet getting to that point? Thank you. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Jeanine. No, we don\u2019t believe that\u2019s a suboptimal place in an industry like ours, that\u2019s proven to be cyclical in nature obviously. And at times very volatile even our current cash position, I\u2019d say, the cash on hand is a percent of market cap, places us roughly in the upper half of the S&P 500. And we think that\u2019s a fantastic position to be in, especially when you think about a cyclical industry like ours. Jeanine Wai : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Leo, please go ahead with your question. Leo Mariani : Hi guys, wanted to follow-up a little bit on the gas macro here, obviously, very topical these days. In the past, I know EOG has spoken about kind of a longer-term oil growth target kind of 8% to 10% per annum. Do you guys feel that at this point in time just giving the changes in the world that U.S. gas is really just going to be higher for longer and you think it would be appropriate to maybe do something similar on the gas side as well. And obviously you kind of talked about the accessibility of your gas to LNG markets down there as well. So just wanted to get a sense if you guys are actively working on perhaps expanding activity over the next few years of Dorado and trying to get that gas international markets. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Leo. This is Ezra. Let me maybe make a few comments and then Lance can follow-up on some more detailed LNG perspectives. In general, what I would say, from the macro perspective, I know this will sound a little bit repetitive, but we based our decisions on investment and gas. The same as we do on investment in oil, and that\u2019s on the premium price deck. So for us, it really comes down to the first question is returns. How quickly can we invest in an asset and still generate high returns year-over-year, still continue to improve upon the asset. And what that means is lowering the finding and development cost every year and bringing, adding lower cost reserves to the base of our company. That\u2019s how we drop the cost base of the company and basically expand the margins going forward. With regards to global supply and demand that comes in second, same as on the oil side. I wouldn\u2019t say that we have an optimal level growth because obviously there\u2019s associated gas, but then we\u2019ve got these pure dry gas plays. So we look at them a little bit agnostically. Long-term, how we do feel, going out longer and thinking about the long-term global energy solution, we do feel the gas is going to play a significant role in that. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re very committed to the $2.50 price that we evaluate the reinvestment on, because we think that\u2019s globally going to be a very competitive and compelling price to be able to base the investments on. Lance? Lance Terveen : Yes, Ezra. Yes, Leo, good morning. Maybe just add a little bit more color too, as you think about just LNG and kind of LNG off-take, but I mean the \u2013 it\u2019s an exciting time and it\u2019s been excellent having some exposure, especially as you think about our JKM exposure and the first mover advantage that we have, because the pendulum like you\u2019re saying \u2013 you\u2019re seeing in the environment today, the pendulum the swinging, you\u2019re seeing more of a demand pool. And so as we think about that, especially from a customer standpoint, I mean we\u2019re very well-positioned. I mean the way we think about it, there\u2019s really three important components of it. And one of them that\u2019s critical is investment grade status and the pristine balance sheet that we have that absolutely puts us and differentiates us. And then as you think about the control that we have with our firm transportation, when we think about LNG off-take, it\u2019s not just from Dorado, but we have firm off-take that can get us from each of our major plays. And then also when you think about supply flexibility too, I mean we have a lot of scale and a lot of flexibility. And so we\u2019re excited about it. Obviously you saw the deal that we\u2019ve done with Cheniere, that\u2019s expanding and increasing our sale that we have there. We feel that that\u2019s very strategic. That helped commercialize Stage 3, which were anticipating hopefully by the end of 2025, I think expected maybe an early 2026. All kind of in line with what we\u2019ve been talking about for a long time. We\u2019ve been working LNG since 2017 and entered into our first agreements in 2019, and then just recently expanded that again. So yes, we definitely have a constructive views. We think about LNG and all those components that I just talked about earlier, we feel puts us very advantage because we can transact quickly and we can move with scale because we have the supply flexibility as well. Leo Mariani : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Definitely sounds like you guys are looking at more deals. Also just wanted to ask about the earlier targets that had put out kind of pre-Ukraine of flat well costs year-over-year. I\u2019m certainly aware that you guys have efficiencies and you\u2019re working really hard on this, but at this point, I mean if you think that\u2019s still a realistic goal just given inflation. I think I heard you say that you got about 50% of the well cost locked up in 2022. Billy Helms : Yes. Leo, this is Billy Helms. Yes. We tried to address that certainly in the last answer we had, but I guess the bottom line is we\u2019re very confident. We\u2019re going to be able to keep our well cost flat this year and we\u2019re going to work hard to do it next year. So it\u2019s early to say what next year\u2019s going to be, but we just have line of sight on so many improvements we can continue to make in our business to fundamentally offset inflation. So we\u2019re very confident in this year\u2019s CapEx and volume targets. Leo Mariani : Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Neal, please go ahead. Neal Dingmann : Yes. Thank you. My first question, as we\u2019re maybe on exploration, I\u2019m just wondering what would it take initial success maybe on a large acreage position such as what webcast or whatever for you to announce another plate or really just a broad question, what generally do you all like to see before publicly rolling out and talking about the next best opportunity you\u2019ll have. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Neal. We like to have confidence in what we\u2019re talking about and bringing out to the public and what that means for us these days and we\u2019ve talked about it a little bit before is these days it\u2019s not just a matter of trying to find oil or gas that has become relatively not too difficult. The challenge for us is to make sure that it\u2019s additive to the quality of our inventory. Like I said earlier, we believe we\u2019ve got the \u2013 really the highest quality and deepest inventory across a multi-basin portfolio as far as North American E&P companies go. And so trying to add to that, trying to add to the double premium rates of return program is challenging and what it takes is long \u2013 some longer-term production results, before we going back to Dorado and the Powder River Basin before we announced those basins to the public, we had some pretty significantly long production results to really make sure that we had captured what we had anticipated capturing. Last thing, we wanted to do is mislead anybody. And so especially looking at some of the new plays that we\u2019re talking about with these hybrid reservoirs, these things are relatively new in nature to the industry. And so gathering some longer-term production results and appraisal wells to really define the extent to these plays is very important and critical before we\u2019d be comfortable talking about them. Neal Dingmann : Got it and great details. And then my follow-up Ezra for you or Billy, just on OFS inflation and maybe logistics, you all continue a great job of mitigating even better than most OFS inflation. I\u2019m just wondering on \u2013 when you look out remainder this year in the 2030 of things sort of stay like they are now. We\u2019ve heard some issues of sand and different things in the Permian, maybe bring it up now Northern life in Wisconsin. Could you talk about \u2013 are you all \u2013 I guess, two questions. One, are you all locking in and continue to do sort of longer term whether that be on the sand, pipe or other side. And then number two, just wondering, would you \u2013 when you think about \u2013 would you have \u2013 if you have opportunities like you did like year or two ago about drill pipe, if those persist, I assume you\u2019ll continue to go after and do some opportunities like that. Billy Helms : Yes. Neal, this is Billy. Certainly, it\u2019s a very dynamic situation we\u2019re dealing with here, but part of the reason we have so much confidence in being able to offset inflation, especially the inflation that the industry is seeing today really goes back to the involvement or engagement of our employees and how committed they are to achieving the goals that are set out. And you might \u2013 for example, talk about sand, especially sand in the Permian. And Jeff kind of went through some of this in detail earlier. The big overlying reason that we have so much confidence is we took ownership. We took control of that many, many years ago. I want to say about 15 years ago. And certainly through that taking ownership, we\u2019ve learned a lot in the past and we continue to look for ways to reduce that cost. And lately, it\u2019s been by getting sand closer to the wellhead. As we move to locate near wellhead, so kind of close to the end user sources of supply, and we can move closer and closer and continue to reduce our cost both on the cost of the sand itself, but also transportation to the wellhead. All the logistics that you see are diminished. We take trucks off the road. It\u2019s just good many, many different ways. We also stay very engaged on the material side, tubulars and those kind of things. We work with meals really across the globe directly. We don\u2019t really go through distributors per se. We work directly with the mills and that way we are able to establish the relationships and capture opportunities at the right time. So it\u2019s just that further engagement in all aspects of our business that allows us to do that and the creativity of our employees that allows us that opportunity. So that\u2019s why we still remain so confident. Neal Dingmann : Very good. Thank you, Billy, for the details. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, Neil. Neil Mehta : Thank you. Team, I have one micro question and then one macro question. The micro question is, as you think about your growth assets the Delaware, the PRB, and Dorado. How do you think about the relative capital allocation and how would you prioritize them based on returns and cost of supply? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Neil, this is Ezra. It\u2019s great to have such high quality inventory across multiple basins. It makes our job with capital allocation and portfolio management, I\u2019m exciting. The way we approach each of them is, looking at where they\u2019re individually at in the life cycle play and basing off on returns. And so even though, the Eagle Ford in there, certainly not a growth asset anymore. But by right sizing that program last year, I think we highlighted this in February. Last year, we turned in the highest rate of return drilling program we ever had in that play. When you think about a play like the Eagle Ford, that\u2019s really a trailblazing type of asset for the entire industry to see how to continue to make one of these resource plays, long life resource plays even better year after year after 12 or 13 years of drilling it. So when we think about the Delaware basin, the Powder River basin, and Dorado just at the high level, we would say the Delaware basin is kind of in the sweet spot, as far as drilling activity, our knowledge base, infrastructure. And the PRB and Dorado are a little bit behind that. We definitely slowed down, as Ken had mentioned, we paused drilling in Dorado during 2020, and we did the same in the Powder River basin. And so we\u2019re early in the life on those plays and so the capital allocation of those two really progresses with the build out of infrastructure and at the pace of which we can incorporate our learnings and continue to make the wells better. Neil Mehta : That makes a lot of sense. So the second is a big picture question, you guys have been doing a lot of work on the oil macro, and it\u2019s obviously a very dynamic environment. But there are two questions associated with it. One is, what do you think the long-term implications of potentially structurally lower Russian production capacity will be for the U.S. producers and for global oil producers. And the second is, how are you thinking about exit to exit U.S. oil production this year? Given some of the constraints that you talked about earlier on the call? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Neil. I\u2019ll start with the second one and reiterate our position on exit to exit U.S. oil hasn\u2019t really changed since February, when you look at kind of the range of forecasts that are out there. We\u2019re on the lower end is the way that we set it in February and that\u2019s what we would stick to today. We think the supply chain constraints and the inflationary issues, the discipline that you\u2019re seeing in North American E&P sector, we think that the U.S. exit to exit oil production growth is going to be on the lower end of most of the forecasts. Longer term with the structural implications for Russian capacity for U.S. and global and how that plays in. We\u2019re watching that the same as everyone else. We have \u2013 it\u2019s a volatile situation. There are things developing as we speak, including the sanctions that are being discussed. And how are those Russian barrels actually continuing to flow and how are they getting discounted and where are they showing up and what is that doing? Ultimately, I take a bigger step back and just say for the last few years, Neil, we\u2019ve been pretty consistent with our model that chronic underinvestment and exploration in our industry is really going to lead to generally lower supply, under supplied for the global supply and demand market longer term. That\u2019s why we continue to explore and we continue to explore for lower cost, higher return assets. And we think that really \u2013 as we\u2019ve said in the past, there\u2019s only a handful of North American E&P companies that have the asset quality, the size, the scale to compete on a global scale with that cost of supply. And on top of that, deliver the barrels with the lower environmental footprint. And in the future, those are the companies that the world\u2019s going to want to fill in additional barrels. And especially, with our operational results in this first quarter, we think, we know \u2013 we feel that EOG is a leader of that group of North American E&Ps. Neil Mehta : The under investment point is definitely playing out. We appreciate it, Ezra. Ezra Yacob : Thank you, Neil. Operator : We have time for one more question today. And our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul, your line is open. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning. Two quick question. One, I think you sort of follow-up to Neil\u2019s question. So does the Russian invasion [indiscernible] change the way how you look at the global market and perhaps that your production outlook or development plan for the company? I think you\u2019ve been saying that you guys will be ready to grow if you think that\u2019s a need from the market. And you will be growing at maybe in the future 8% to 10% annual kind of growth rate on the maximum. So wondering if those kind of yield has been changed in any shape or form because of the recent events. The second question that you talk about Powder River basin. So what will it take for that development pace to accelerate. Ezra Yacob : Yes. Paul, this is Ezra. I think I can answer both of those questions almost in the same manner. When we came out with the 8% to 10% growth, which was maybe close to 20 months ago now. That was \u2013 and I think we said at that time, it\u2019s dynamic, at that time that 8% to 10% model was reflective of what we could do to optimize near-term and long-term free cash flow with the current inventory and our current knowledge base. And as you can see, things continue to change for the better for us. We continue to drive down costs. We continue to drive forward each of our, let\u2019s call them, emerging place with the Powder River basin and Dorado. And so when we talk about what\u2019s a good growth rate going forward, it comes back to those two things that I started off the call with Doug with the first his optimizing our returns, investing at a pace where we can really create long-term shareholder value. And you do that through adding lower cost reserves to the base of the company. So driving down the cost base of the company, while also reinvesting so that you can turn your cash over quickly. Our wells this year, it\u2019s strip price since we base it on a $40 investment. What that really translates to wells that pay out on average in two to three months right now on the strip price. So it\u2019s a fantastic place to be, and it\u2019s really strengthening the base of the business and the company going forward. With regards to the PRB, it falls under the same type of line. It all depends on how we build out our infrastructure in that basin and moving out of pace to be able to incorporate our learnings to drive down the well costs. Last quarter, I think we highlighted, we had dropped the Niobrara well cost pretty significantly over the past year 2021, which was just tremendous results. And as we continue to see progress like that, we feel more confident to go ahead and allocate more capital to that portfolio \u2013 to that basin. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Operator : That is all the time we have for questions today. So I\u2019ll now have the call back to Mr. Yacob to conclude. Ezra Yacob : Yes. We\u2019d like to thank everyone for participating on the call this morning. And thanks to our shareholders for your support. We especially want to recognize each of our employees for their commitment to excellence and on delivering such an outstanding start to the year for EOG. Operator : Thank you everyone for joining our call today. This concludes our call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone. And welcome to the EOG Resources\u2019 Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer, EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir. Tim Driggers : Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG\u2019s SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures can be found on EOG\u2019s website. This conference call also include estimated resource potential, not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC\u2019s reserve reporting guidelines. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chief Executive Officer; Billy Helms, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Jeff Leitzell, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor Relations. Here is Ezra. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday we declared a third special dividend for the year, demonstrating our commitment to deliver long-term shareholder value through our cash return strategy. The $1.50 dividend is supported by another outstanding quarter. We posted adjusted earnings of $2.74 per share and nearly $1.3 billion of free cash flow. So far this year, we have declared $4.30 per share of special dividends. Combined with our peer-leading annualized regular dividend of $3 per share, we are on pace to pay out a minimum of 60% of annual free cash flow. What continues to differentiate EOG is our people and our assets. We have cultivated an inventory of premium and double premium wells that provide a 20-year runway for the company through our focus on organic exploration, supported by a decentralized organizational structure. Our multi-basin portfolio is predominantly the result of having seven North American and one international cross-functional exploration teams that work independently, but collaborate on shared learnings. Our role here in Houston beyond capital allocation is to facilitate those shared learnings across all eight teams. The result is a robust exploration pipeline that continues to both improve the quality of and expand our more than 20-year inventory of premium and double premium wells. Our portfolio includes the Delaware Basin, which remains the largest area of activity in the company and is delivering exceptional returns. After more than a decade of high return drilling, our Eagle Ford asset continues to deliver top tier results while operating at a steady pace. And our emerging South Texas Dorado dry natural gas play and Powder River Basin Mowry and Niobrara combo plays are contributing to EOG\u2019s success today and laying the groundwork for years of future high return investment. In addition, we have tested our Mowry and Niobrara plays in the northern Powder River Basin. Our initial results have demonstrated the untapped potential of this oilier part of the basin as a compliment to the outstanding performance in the southern part of the basin. EOG\u2019s current multi-basin portfolio, offering exposure to both geographic and product diversity alongside several other prospects in our exploration pipeline will continue to expand EOG\u2019s premium inventory and provide through the cycle value creation. Disciplined reinvestment within any given play depends on where we are in the development life cycle of that play. Our multi-basin and portfolio of high return assets, all competitive against our premium hurdle rate, provides invaluable flexibility to invest at the pace that allows each play to get better. It also allows us to plan around basin level market dynamics, impacting services and infrastructure to minimize inflation and bottlenecks. We are able to optimize reinvestment across our total portfolio to add reserves at low refining costs, lower the overall cost base of the company, and continue to improve EOG\u2019s company-wide capital efficiency. This quarter, we are highlighting, iSense, our continuous methane monitoring system that we piloted in the Delaware Basin and are now deploying in our most active development areas. iSense is yet another example of how EOG\u2019s decentralized model, not only fosters innovation across eight teams, but also compounds the impact of innovation by taking ideas born in one operating area and expanding them across multiple basins. From the latest information technology-driven solutions to reduce emissions, to innovation focused on drilling and completions operations, to procurement of casing and sand EOG is unique in its ability to leverage its culture and operating structure to get incrementally better every year. The tremendous inventory and cost improvements we have made over the last several years, provides high confidence in the low breakevens and operational flexibility of our business. This confidence in our business, along with the strength of our industry-leading balance sheet, [indiscernible] this quarter to terminate a significant portion of our oil and natural gas hedges. Going forward, we expect to hedge significantly less than the 20% to 30% of volumes we typically hedged in prior years. The current operating environment is challenging given the volatility of commodity prices and inflation headwinds. Through it all our employees have remained focused on execution and have improved the business. Our second quarter performance is proof of that. We delivered more oil for less capital and in the face of a unique inflationary environment, our forecast for capital expenditure this year remains unchanged. EOG\u2019s, consistent execution, low cost structure, reduced hedge position and transparent cash return strategy based on a regular dividend that we have never suspended or cut that has grown 21 of the last 24 years and is now competitive with the broader market, puts EOG in its strongest position ever to deliver significant value to shareholders through the cycle. Here is Billy with an operational update and early look at 2023. Billy Helms : Thanks Ezra. We posted outstanding results in the second quarter. Our performance included exceeding the midpoints of our production guidance while capital expenditures and total per unit operating cost beat forecasted targets. So once again, more oil for less capital. I\u2019d like to thank our employees for their dedication and persistence to execute and deliver such outstanding results. As we have guided to all year, our oil growth year-over-year will be about 4% to return our production to pre-COVID levels. Halfway through the year, we\u2019re on track to deliver that objective and have done so against a challenging supply chain backdrop. The upper price pressure on steel, fuel and labor continues due to ongoing supply constraints initiated by COVID and extended by the war in Ukraine. The impact of this has resulted in inflationary headwinds that have meaningfully exceeded our initial expectations earlier this year, making it increasingly challenging to maintain flat well cost. However, our employees continue to innovate and deliver efficiencies that offset a significant portion of this inflationary pressure. For example, in our Delaware Basin drilling operation, our down-hole drilling motor program is providing solid performance improvements, generating a 13% year-over-year increase in the foots drilled promoter run. The motor program and other improvements, are reducing drilling times versus last year. In the Eagle Ford, our drilling teams have improved the footage drilled per day by 11% versus last year, while also managing drilling parameters to reduce the cost of drilling fluids by 10%. In our completion operations, we had previously discussed the company\u2019s plans to increase the use of super-zipper completions, which are 40% faster than normal zipper operations. We have now utilized this technique on about 65% of EOG\u2019s completed wells year-to-date, which is yielding an 11% improvement in the lateral footage completed per day. Super-zipper completions combined with our focus on more efficient operational practices, has increased the amount of pumping hours per day by 24%. In addition, we continue to progress our self-sourced sand program and expect to further reduce sand cost in the second half of the year and extend those savings into 2023. All in all, we now expect our well cost to see a modest, single digit increase over last year. And most of this increase will be seen in the second half of the year. However, we\u2019re able to leverage our operational flexibility within our multi-basin portfolio, such that our capital and volume plan remains unchanged. Now turning to the macro backdrop, oil field service capacity remains extremely tight and is further constrained by the limited availability of materials and experienced labor, driving uncertainty in the cost of services, not only for this year, but also for 2023. These constraints are more concentrated in areas with the highest activities such as the Permian Basin. EOG\u2019s multi-basin portfolio provides us the flexibility to manage these constraints by optimizing activity between our multiple plays to maximize our return on investment. Just as in the past EOG will play to its strengths to mitigate where possible the inflationary pressure and operational constraints facing us. We\u2019re currently taking steps to secure services for next year, and we\u2019ll know more about the 2023 outlook next quarter. Regarding production growth, it\u2019s too early to discuss next year\u2019s plans with any degree of precision. However, it is important to recognize we will maintain our discipline. And as we see things today, would expect low, single digit oil growth similar to this year. On the natural gas side, we\u2019re excited about the results of our South Texas Dorado play and its ability to play an increasing role in supplying the growing demand of petrochemical and LNG markets along the Gulf Coast. As we allocate future capital based on returns, this play will command additional investment, not only to meet the growing demand, but also for infrastructure needed to capture the value chain from the wellhead to the market center. These investments not only generate healthy returns, but ultimately lead to lower well cost and lower long-term unit operating cost. We also expect to fund our emerging and promising exploration plays as we improve the company for the future. Now here is Ken to give you an update on our emissions reductions effort. Ken Boedeker : Thanks, Billy. This quarter, we are providing details on our continuous methane monitoring project, which is an example of the progress we\u2019re making in our emission reduction efforts. Over the last several years, our leak detection and repair program, or LDAR has advanced from sound, sight, smell surveys to surveys using more accurate optical gas imaging, to today\u2019s deployment of scalable solutions of the latest technology, continuous methane monitoring. This technology detects potential leaks and provides real-time alerts to help accelerate repairs and will provide data and trend analysis to potentially prevent future methane releases. We\u2019ve been evaluating continuous methane monitoring technology for a few years. There are several third-party systems and technologies available to monitor and detect potential methane leaks, which use intermittent or continuous monitoring technology. About 18 months ago, we began a pilot project using a solution we built in-house named iSense, which is a fence-line monitoring solution that uses methane sensing technology to continuously monitor facilities and provide real-time alerts of potential leaks to a central control room. We tested iSense against monitoring solutions in use and available in the market today and confirmed that our sensor detected methane release events consistent with these third-party systems. The results from these tests confirmed that iSense is the most effective solution for EOG to use, to detect and accelerate leak repairs while also being scalable and economic. Like so many of our innovations, this technology is being spearheaded by our employees across the company. Since the pilot, our employees are rapidly deploying iSense in the field, prioritizing areas of highest potential impact. The initial installations are focused in the Delaware basin and currently cover about 60% of our production. We expect that most of the remaining Delaware basin production will be monitored by iSense by year-end. We\u2019ll continue to roll out iSense in other operating areas next year. Using our proprietary system allows us to own the data creation, flow and storage, which is a priority with all our information systems, owning the iSense data and retaining direct control of its collection provides invaluable flexibility to improve both data quality, as well as the tools to analyze and integrate iSense data with existing operational data from our production facilities. This data, along with our ability to monitor our operations for many of our four control rooms will enhance the 24/7 capability to continuously identify, prioritize and repair leaks. In the future, when data from iSense is paired with other real-time production data, we expect to be able to make improvements in the design of facilities to minimize releases. We\u2019re also optimistic that we will be able to more readily predict the likely size and source of a methane release. Leveraging technology to enhance our methane leak detection and repair program is another great example of EOG\u2019s culture of continuous improvement throughout all our operations. Our employees have embraced the company\u2019s a mission reduction efforts and I\u2019m excited to see how EOG\u2019s culture of innovation and technology will continue to drive creative solutions. Now here\u2019s Jeff to discuss the progress we\u2019ve made in our premium combo play in the Southern Powder River Basin. Jeff Leitzell : Thanks Ken, our emerging Mowry and Niobrara plays in the Southern Powder River Basin have made significant progress recently. The powder returned to steady development last year, after a pullback in 2020, driven by the pandemic. Results in 2021 were stellar with respect to both well performance and well cost reduction. Strong results to-date combined with the benefit of infrastructure investments have positioned the Mowry and Niobrara plays to command more capital in 2023 and beyond. The Powder River Basin is an established operating area for both EOG and the industry that has experienced several chapters of development over its history. The latest chapter for EOG kicked off in 2018 when we moved the Mowry and Niobrara plays into commercial development, we identified nearly 1,500 net premium locations between both targets over our 130,000 net acre position in the Southern part of the basin. Since 2018, we have made great strides in fine tuning our technical model to improve the predictability and performance of the wells. We\u2019ve delineated the different parts of the basin, hydrating the specific landing zones. The basin has stacked potential similar to the Permian with two widespread well-known, very robust source rocks in the Mowry and Niobrara. Amongst those two source rocks are hybrid opportunities, such as silt zones and sand zones, a whole section of reservoir that really lends itself to horizontal drilling and completions. We have also made targeted infrastructure investments in recent years, which have helped lower the cost structure in each play. We have added nearly 40 miles of water pipeline in 2.5 million barrels of water storage capacity. Our water infrastructure investment in the PRB has allowed us to source about 90% of our water used in our operations from reuse, reducing costs for both water sourcing and disposal. We have also invested in infrastructure to enable local sand sourcing, the installation of a high pressure gas gathering system has been instrumental in achieving a 99.8% gas capture rate. The infrastructure is also benefiting our operating costs, per unit lease, operating expense in the powder is among the lowest in the company. The PRB is farther from market than some of our other premium plays. However, the Mowry and Niobrara have several advantages that more than make up for it. First and foremost, the wells have some of the largest per well reserves in the company on a barrel of oil equivalent basis. In the Southern PRB, the Niobrara and Mowry formations are more combo that is they produce a mix of oil and natural gas. While the laterals are also longer at 9,500 feet, which contributes to the higher recoveries while performance is mostly due to the quality of the reservoir and composition of the products with a large component of natural gas that supports higher recoveries. To-date, EOG has completed about 40 net Mowry and Niobrara wells in the Southern PRB. This year, we anticipate completing 15 net Mowry and Niobrara wells and expect to significantly increase that activity next year. As a result of our exploration work on the entire Powder River Basin hydrocarbon system over the last few years, we have also built an additional 110 net acre block in the north, extending our acreage in the productive fairway to 90 miles. The Northern area is a historically underexplored part of the basin. And after recognizing the potential in the area, we corded up acreage adjacent to our legacy 8 acreage through a series of trades and small bolt-on transactions, utilizing reservoir data for multiple plays. We identified landing zones in the Mowry and Niobrara formation with favorable petrophysical and geomechanical properties and began testing. We drilled four successful delineation wells, which we believe are industry first in the area. While it is still early in the delineation, we\u2019ve confirmed the development potential of our Northern Powder River Basin acreage to add to our future premium inventory. The Mowry and Niobrara combo plays in the Southern Powder River Basin stand today, well positioned to compete for capital within the portfolio and combined with our position to the north, the basin has significant investment potential for years to come. Next up is Lance to provide some color on our marketing position in the Powder. Lance Terveen : Thanks Jeff. As we look further downstream, the investment in infrastructure that has lowered the cost structure in the Southern Powder River Basin also allows us to apply our time tested marketing strategy of establishing multiple connections to provide market pricing diversification. Today, we hold sufficient processing, transportation and fractionation capacity for natural gas liquids out of the PRB. We have access to both the Mid-Continent at Conway, Kansas, and the Gulf Coast at Mount Bellevue, Texas, and underappreciated aspect of the Mowry and Niobrara wells is the prolific NGL production and the heavier post-processing mix of NGLs they produce. After processing to minimize ethane extraction, our Powder River Basin in NGL barrel contains approximately 10% ethane, 45% propane, and the remainder being butanes and more of a heavier NGLs resulting in an NGL to WTI price ratio of over 50%. In the first half of this year, our NGL price realization was $53.01, which is a $7.17 premium to the Mount Bellevue typical barrel. In addition, the quality of the Powder River Basin oil has an average API gravity of 44 to 47 and remains in high demand. During the first half of this year, realized prices for our oil production out of the PRB were WTI plus $1.63 with access to both Wyoming and Cushing, Oklahoma markets. Stepping back, I\u2019d like to review our marketing strategy for the company as a whole and all our active development areas we want to retain control of our products and establish multiple sales points, which adds significant value. For example, in the first half of this year, we transported an average of 188,000 barrels of oil per day for export, which represents about 30% of gross production with optionality to sell based on a WTI or a Brent Index with the widening of the Brent WTI spread, we have the opportunity to take advantage of our capacity to deliver up to 250,000 barrels of oil per day for export. For propane, we have delivered 19,000 barrels per day for export at premium prices to Mount Bellevue. We also continue to see strong uplift in our natural gas price realizations due to our early mover advantage, securing 140,000 MMBtus per day, linked to JKM through Cheniere LNG facility in Corpus Christi. Cheniere recently announced FID or final investment decision on Stage 3 in Corpus Christi. When Stage 3 goes in service, EOG will triple its exposure to JKM to 420,000 MMBtus per day. We continue to see constructive long-term demand for all our products, both domestically along the Gulf Coast and internationally. To unlock that value, you need control of your products, transportation capacity, and an early mover advantage to capture spreads quickly. As we look down the road, EOG is well positioned to capture the strength of prices in these export markets to generate additional cash flow and value to shareholders. Next up is Ezra for concluding remarks. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Lance. We believe EOG is differentiated for the following reasons. We have a diverse portfolio of assets across multiple basins providing geographic and product diversity. We are a reliable and consistent high performing operator. We have among the lowest cost structures. We are committed to sustainability. We maintain an exceptional balance sheet. Our cash return strategy is transparent. Our regular dividend is competitive with the broader market. And finally, the EOG culture is one of a kind and it\u2019s at the core of our differentiated performance. We believe there are only a handful of North American E&P companies that have the asset quality, the size, the scale to compete globally on oil and gas cost of supply. And on top of that, produce the barrels with a lower environmental footprint. In the future, those are the companies that the world is going to want to deliver additional barrels. And we firmly believe that EOG is a leader in that group of North American E&Ps. Thanks for listening. We\u2019ll now go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Leo Mariani of MKM Partners. Leo, please go ahead. Leo Mariani : Hey guys, totally realize that it\u2019s obviously way too early for 2023 guidance at this point. You guys did have some prepared comments, which kind of said as things stand today. You would look to grow oil kind of low-single digits next year. I guess it feels like a bit of a pivot from what you all had said in the past, which was kind of this 8% to 10% oil growth would kind of be optimal sort of operating speed for EOG as kind of something changed in terms of how you look at kind of optimizing the operations versus the growth of the company. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Leo, this is Ezra. I appreciate your question. Really, what we\u2019ve always talked about is that our growth is really the output of our ability to generate high returns from a disciplined reinvestment strategy. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve tried to describe today is as you pointed out, first of all, it is early to talk about 2023. But ultimately, we\u2019re committed to remaining disciplined. We want to focus investment in each of our assets at a level where they can continue to improve every year. Directionally, as we see it today, how the supply and demand balances look, the constraints on services, the associated inflationary pressures, oil growth will likely be similar to this year. And as Billy highlighted, we\u2019d expect to direct additional investment towards our Dorado natural gas play based on the positive results that we\u2019re seeing there. Leo Mariani : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And I just wanted to ask on the capital. Obviously, you\u2019re one of the few companies did not raise the CapEx budget thus far here in 2022. You described a lot of the ways that you\u2019re able to kind of keep costs lower and some of the innovation that you\u2019ve sort of had. I did notice that you did pull some of the wells out of the schedule this year. It\u2019s not big numbers, just talking a few on the margin. Just wanted to get a sense, is there any thought that you\u2019re maybe doing a little bit less to kind of stay within the budget and just kind of looking at where you were in the first half and third quarter guidance. Is it fair to say you\u2019re probably kind of in the upper half of the CapEx for the year? Billy Helms : Yes. Leo, this is Billy Helms. Yes, the small change in well count is really just a result of two things, one is timing. Some of the wells that were scheduled to complete at year-end are going to slip into the next year. It\u2019s just a timing thing. The other factor that plays into that is a change in working interest in some of our plays. We\u2019ve had slightly lower working interest in some of our Delaware Basin wells in the second half of the year. Just to illustrate how minimal that is, that\u2019s only about a 2% average change in working interest across the year. So it\u2019s a very minuscule amount, but that explains the change in the well count. As far as the CapEx, we\u2019re very pleased, as you can tell from the comments we made about the ability of our teams to continue to innovate and drive efficiencies in our business to offset inflation. Inflation turns out to be just a little bit higher than we anticipated this year, so we are going to see a slight increase in our well cost as we go through especially the second half of the year, but we\u2019re still confident we\u2019re going to stay within our guidance and don\u2019t expect to face additional costs that will increase our budget. Leo Mariani : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan Chase. Arun, please go ahead. Arun Jayaram : Hey, good morning. I appreciate the color on the Powder River Basin, but I guess my first question is just thinking about capital allocation between the basins as we think about next year. Today, Ezra, I think 22 of 24 of your rig lines are either in the Delaware or Eagle Ford, you have one rig in the Powder River Basin. You mentioned in your comments you plan to lean a little bit on Dorado next year and significantly increase perhaps the mix of activity in the Powder River Basin. Just wondering if you can give us a sense of how your activity could shift as we think about next year and how many rig lines you may have in the Powder. Billy Helms : Yes, Arun, this is Billy. As far as capital allocation, as we see it today, there\u2019s a lot of factors play into that, of course, and it\u2019s early to say where we\u2019re going to be still we\u2019ll have quite a bit of activity in the Delaware Basin going forward. It is a premier play in the company, and certainly, that will continue to command quite a bit of capital. Eagle Ford has been, as you know, a performance engine for the company for the last decade or longer. And that will \u2013 and they\u2019re generating outstanding results. So that will still command capital. As we compare \u2013 we allocate capital based on returns and certainly, the encouragement we\u2019re seeing from Dorado and the activity there is showing us the ability to be able to continue to fund that program going forward. And then the confidence we have in the new emerging Powder River Basin gives us a sense that, that will also come in quite a bit of activity. So the ratios, I would say, are going to stay similar. As far as the Powder River Basin and our overall capital plan, that will depend on the outlook for commodities at that time, but the \u2013 what we\u2019re going to see in the Powder, just to be clear, is a shift of activity from some of their older traditional plays, the Turner and the Parkman to some of the deeper, more emerging plays and then Mowry more specifically and the Nio. So you\u2019ll see that shift. The amount of capital allocated to that play will also depend on just the commodity price outlook that we see for the year once we get closer to that. But overall, we\u2019re \u2013 the takeaway from that, I would think, would be that the flexibility we have with the multiple plays we have to chase to continue to add value long-term to the shareholders. Arun Jayaram : Great. My follow-up is just maybe one for Tim. Just maybe a housekeeping question. Tim, in the 10-Q, you have $1.8 billion of collateral postings associated with hedge activity. I was wondered if you could help us think about the potential runoff of those collateral postings as well as maybe the timing of when you plan to pay off the $1.25 billion of bonds. Is that later this year or in 2023? Tim Driggers : Yes. This is Tim. As far as the bond, that is 2023. It\u2019s in the first quarter of 2023 is when that will mature. We have no plans to pay it off early. As far as the collateral they run off kind of like the hedges that we\u2019ve given you the timing of when those hedges are in our 10-Q. So it kind of runs off as that timing comes off. It all depends, of course, on where the strip goes, how that comes off. But right now, it\u2019s based on the strip, and that would be how it would come off, just as those run off. Arun Jayaram : All right, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Scott, please go ahead. Scott Hanold : Yes. Thanks. And if I could ask a question, one more question maybe on the PRB. You all highlight some good commodity price realizations that you\u2019re all seeing there. Is that something that you think can persist going forward? And is it a function of what\u2019s happening in the basin overall? Or is it specifically something EOG\u2019s got in place that allows you to kind of benefit there a little bit more. Lance Terveen : Hey Scott, this is Lance Terveen. Thanks for your question. Yes, when you think about the price realizations, I think the broader message is just you can really just see how competitive the Powder is with all our other plays. I mean, operationally, I mean, you heard Jeff kind of outline a lot of things in the opening comments, but even for our products, we continue to just really see it being in high demand. For example, like even on the crude, you have to remember one of the important attributes up in the Powder, especially related to EOG, is just think about the crude quality. I mean today, we\u2019re kind of seeing right around 44, 45. We expect that to kind of be a 44, 47, kind of over time. And so we really want to protect that quality. We\u2019ve secured 500,000 barrels of storage is kind of in the field. We\u2019ve got firm capacity to both Guernsey and the Cushing market. So having that multiple flexibility where we can show that kind of high demand barrel and the API quality that we have keep it kind of segregated with that API quality, it\u2019s really a value when we sell direct to our refiners. And so just being able to have that value and have that quality and consistency is key, and so we draw a lot of that experience from what we\u2019ve done in the Eagle Ford and also in the Powder \u2013 I mean, I\u2019m sorry, in the Delaware Basin. But yes, that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 the quality is what you\u2019re seeing on the price realizations. And then as you think about the NGLs, you\u2019re seeing mostly ethane rejection that\u2019s happening there. So most of that, you\u2019re seeing the ethane that\u2019s going to be going more towards like an MMBtu or selling that as a gas. And so that is a heavier barrel that you\u2019re seeing that we kind of show. But again, we have the market flexibility. We can show that barrel in Conway. We can also show that barrel in Mont Belvieu. So we can kind of are that flexibility to and look at those spreads. So getting kind of back to your question, I mean, really the quality and then the flexibility that we have with the multiple markets and it\u2019s in an area that\u2019s absolutely in demand as we. Scott Hanold : Got it. Thanks for that. And as my follow-up, I want to ask a question on Trinidad. And it looks like you\u2019re guiding down a fair amount for gas production in Trinidad. And I know you\u2019ve had some exploration success there, and I think you\u2019re drilling a development or you have or you\u2019re going to be drilling a development well this year. So can you give us a sense of like what to expect from Trinidad? And is it more of the relative pricing dynamic there versus Dorado in terms of like which play is going to get sort of more capital investment? Billy Helms : Yes, Scott, this is Billy Helms. So for Trinidad, we\u2019ve had, as you know, a long successful history of really maintaining pretty much flat production with minimal investment, and it generates quite a bit of cash for the company \u2013 cash flow for the company. So it\u2019s been a very successful project for multiple decades now. We still see exploration opportunities and are still counting on exploration success going forward just based on the things we see today. The small guide down in gas production, especially in the next, say, the rest of this year, is based on some turnaround projects we have on some of the compressor stations and platforms in the field. So it\u2019s just an operational issue really in the manifest in the third quarter mainly. So -- but as we start to drill some of these exploration wells, we still have confidence that production base will continue. Scott Hanold : Okay. Okay. So it should turn around back to sort of normal levels by early 2023. Is that right? Billy Helms : Yes, that\u2019s right. Scott Hanold : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Scott, please go ahead. Scott Gruber : Yes, good morning. Just coming back to the inflation question, I know you guys have previously commented that you don\u2019t see an outsized inflationary impact on EOG next year from contract role or any other factors. But have you engaged in these earlier than normal discussions for services and consumables, et cetera. Are you still confident that the inflation that you experienced next year will not be any worse than the industry trends? Billy Helms : Yes, Scott, this is Billy Helms, again. On the inflation question, I think I would distinguish a little bit there. I think we\u2019re recognizing the inflation that everybody else in the industry is seeing. We\u2019re able to combat that really through a lot of the efficiencies we drive through our business. And that\u2019s really a result of the culture we have of continuous improvement and the quality of the staff we have in each of our operating divisions. So now the contracting strategy has always been a long-term thing for EOG. We worked with our vendors, our partners on the service side. And our contracts are always a little bit staggered so that all the contracts don\u2019t roll off at the same time. That gives us a lot of flexibility to also manage the commodity cycles to make sure we have a consistent operating performance level going into the year. We always start about this time of year. So I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re starting any earlier than we typically do. I think we always started sometime here in the middle part of the year to start securing services for the next year as we see things play out. We take opportunities as we see those emerge to make arrangements with vendors and our service partners to secure those services in the upcoming year and that determines the level of services that we secure for next year\u2019s well cost. We typically like to think about securing about 50% to 60% of the well cost ahead of any given year. And that range depends on the opportunities we see with service partners to lock in those services. This year, we expect to be somewhat the same as we go into next year, but it -- we\u2019ll see as we get closer to the year-end, but that\u2019s how we see the inflation. Obviously, we expect with the tightness in the market, we\u2019re going to see some additional inflationary pressure going into next year. So just anticipating that, we could see another uptick in our well cost going into next year, but we expect to, again, moderate a lot of that with our efficiency gains. Scott Gruber : Got it. And then a follow-up here on the 60% distribution threshold really in light of the early hedge settlement payments you made this quarter, so if you include those payments which you guys are doing your reporting, then you guys are running ahead of the threshold. But if you assume those are more of a onetime hit to free cash, then you\u2019re running a little bit behind that threshold. And I know you look at the threshold on an annual basis. So I guess the question is, what\u2019s your appetite to approach the 60% payout for the year removing the impact of the $1.3 billion in early head settlement payments? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Scott, this is Ezra. Just a little bit of color on that. Obviously, the Board decides the dividend each quarter. They review our business needs, the macro environment, the cash position, so on and so forth. And as you said, the $1.50 per share special this quarter, which brings the total dividend commitment to right at $7.30 per share is on pace to achieve the minimum of a 60% free cash flow return. And I think that\u2019s the emphasis on there is that the 60% is a minimum. Ultimately, it\u2019s up to the Board, like I said, to return additional cash in 2022. The way to think about those early terminations of the hedges is really a reflection, I think, of our confidence in improving the financial profile of the company. Our ability to navigate inflationary pressures this year flexibility to allocate capital across multiple resource plays, which are each delivering exceptional returns and really our ability to continue to lower the cost base of the company. These are all things that deliver expanded free cash flow opportunities for EOG. Scott Gruber : Great. Appreciate the color, Ezra. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann from Truist Securities. Neal, please go ahead. Neal Dingmann : My first question is maybe for you or Tim, on a little bit different capital allocation. Specifically, I\u2019m trying to get a sense of what you all would need to see either quantitative and qualitatively need to see to start potentially look at more or, I guess, as guys calling out there leading into buybacks. Do you have an understand you all have bought back shares for years and we did see a decent decline a month or so from the highs. So I\u2019m just wondering when you guys think about buybacks, what -- when you say opportunistic, what really goes into that? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Neal, this is Ezra. Thank you for the question. Basically, we evaluate a buyback just like any other investment decision. And really, what we do is we look to see how it\u2019s going to create long-term shareholder value. And as you highlighted and as we\u2019ve discussed previously, the $5 billion share repurchase authorization that we have in place, we\u2019ve talked about using it opportunistically. And what that means for us is using it during times of what we would say are significant dislocations in the market. And that\u2019s as opposed to a more programmatic system. And quite frankly, this year, during Q2, we didn\u2019t really see a what we would say was a significant dislocation. We definitely witnessed a lot of volatility, I think, rather than a dislocation. The volatility was due -- is driven by changes to the oil inventories that we saw that was really due to the SPR releases. We saw some concern over demand destruction associated with the inflationary pressures across the broad market. We saw some potential for weaker demand associated with the uptick of COVID cases. But ultimately, in our view, these are all kind of short-term events that really don\u2019t change the fundamental supply and demand picture. Neal Dingmann : I like how you all thinking about that, Ezra. And then my second or follow-up likely for Billy, just on vertical integration, specifically. You all have other areas -- other oilfield service areas besides you mentioned the self-sourced sand. And I\u2019m just wondering do you have other areas that, I guess, you would call it more vertically integrated or that you would think about doing that. And I\u2019m just wondering that also on that self-source sand, how much capacity do you have on that side? Billy Helms : Yes, Neal, this is Billy. Certainly, on the self-source sand, you named one of the primary ones. It\u2019s a big part of our program. We\u2019ve been doing that, as you might remember, for more than a decade. And what we\u2019ve been able to do is find ways to get the source of the sand closer and closer to the wellhead, minimizing not only the cost of the product, but also the transportation involved in getting it to the wellhead. We are expanding that through the rest of the year such that we\u2019ll be able to continue to supply greater and greater amounts from our own self-sourced mines, so we\u2019re excited about the growth in that. Other areas that we self source, there\u2019s a number of them. I mentioned briefly in the prepared comments, a note to our efforts to take control of the drilling motors that we use in our drilling operation. That\u2019s a small thing maybe, but it\u2019s a big driver of performance when it comes to that part of the business. And we recognized that a couple of years ago, built up some expertise in our staff to address that. We worked specifically to not only design, but also build and oversee the maintenance of those motors that ultimately drives the improved performance and we\u2019re seeing great results from that program. And that\u2019s another differentiator in our drilling performance that allows us to continue to offset inflation. Some of the other things, as you know, we\u2019ve been managing our tubular inventory for many, many years as well. we deal directly with the steel mills, which gives us a lot of advantages in the sense of having some clarity or some certainty on the market and kind of what that\u2019s indicating to get ahead of issues where we see it, take advantage of opportunities to secure those at lower cost and make sure that we have pipe for our programs on a go-forward basis. So those are maybe a couple of other things that would give you some color on what we\u2019re doing. Neal Dingmann : That\u2019s great details, Billy. Thank you guys for the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Doug, please go ahead. Doug Leggate, your line is now open. You can proceed with your question. Doug Leggate : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for letting me on. Ezra, Slide 5, your latest assessment of cash flow doesn\u2019t give any numbers around it in terms of breakeven. I wonder if I could just ask you to look into 2023 and give us an update of where you see your sustaining capital and the breakeven oil and gas prices that go along with that, the assumptions behind that, if you don\u2019t mind. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Doug, we haven\u2019t released that and we did remove the breakeven slide from earlier this year, because of the significant change in gas prices that have gone on in the first six months of the year. The best thing I can point to is the fact that we continue to bring on lower-cost reserves, basically focused on the premium and double premium wells into the cost base of the company. You can look at the reduction in our unit costs and the reduction in our DD&A rate year-over-year to kind of infer the reduction in our breakevens. Doug Leggate : Okay. I\u2019ll push David on this and see if we can get him to put it back in, because it\u2019s a pretty critical input to, obviously, the market\u2019s perception of free cash flow, but I appreciate the answer. My follow-up Ezra, I apologize in advance, you\u2019re not going to like this, but it\u2019s a follow-up from the share buyback question. Application in your stock is subjected obviously, but if I look at your share performance in absolute terms and in relative terms in particular for the last four or five years it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s really struggled to against the rest of the sector. And one could interpret from your comments about dislocations and a version perhaps the buybacks that you don\u2019t see value in your stock. So if you could address that versus the transitory nature of a special dividend, why you wouldn\u2019t want to step in to just about every one of your peers is doing something on buybacks and their share performance is quite different from yours on a relative basis. So any thoughts around that would be appreciated? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Doug. The first thing I would say is that, that\u2019s right, I think it\u2019s stating the obvious that that I feel that our stock is undervalued right now. But again we look at that buyback and investment in that buyback we compare it against other opportunities in the business to create shareholder value \u2013 long-term shareholder value. And when we do that, when we compare it versus reinvesting in the business drilling these double premium, these premium wells at a 30% and a 60% direct after tax rate return based on $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. It\u2019s a very, very high hurdle. So when we think about what can create longer term value for the shareholder, we see the benefit of reinvesting in the business, driving down our long-term well cost, lowering the break evens as we talked about has a very, very competitive portion of allocation. Now with regards on the transitory nature comparison with the transferring nature of a special dividend, I think again it goes back to the way that we look at the buyback with regard to our shareholders. Buying repurchasing shares during a volatile movement in the stock price, I think our shareholders prefer to have the assurity of special dividends coming back to them as opposed to us trying to time the volatility in the markets. Now that\u2019s different from what \u2013 again, I would go back to what we call a significant market dislocation, where I think though you\u2019d have an opportunity there that would compete very favorably to create long-term shareholder value. Doug Leggate : It\u2019s a tricky one, I guess, a special dividend doesn\u2019t reinvesting and if you think your stock is undervalued, then one could argue that the volatility is something you got to live with, but you think \u2013 I guess we\u2019re never going to \u2013 we\u2019re probably not going to agree on this, but it seems to me the special dividend is, yes, it\u2019s the lesser permanent input from the share price, I guess is what I was getting at. But anyway, I appreciate your answer, as I always appreciate your perspective. Thank you. Ezra Yacob : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Paul, please go ahead. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning. Two questions please. Ezra, could you comment on the A&D market in, for example, in Eagle Ford, I think you gentlemen have said the asset is getting a little bit tired. So do you see opportunity to make maybe more sizeable bolt-on acquisition that to beef up the operation there? And secondly, that just wondering that have you guys get a chance to review the new tender proposal on the tax law changes? And how that \u2013 what would be any major impact to EOG? Thank you. Ezra Yacob : Thank you, Paul. This is Ezra. Let me attack that first question on the Eagle Ford and then I\u2019ll hand it over to Tim Driggers to give some feedback on the tax law proposals. So on the A&D market there in the Eagle Ford, yes, let me \u2013 let me clarify how we\u2019re viewing the Eagle Ford right now. We\u2019re on pace to deliver for the second year in the row, basically record rates have return and record finding costs in our drilling program there. And the big thing that it comes to is it kind of fits back into some of my opening comments talking about the right investment rate for plays at different life cycles. So clearly our Eagle Ford position has reached a point where it\u2019s not a main focus area for growth anymore, but what we see is a very, very long runway of exceptional returns on those wells as you were reinvesting them assuming that we\u2019re moving at the right pace, where our team has the ability to execute on lowering costs, increasing incrementally the well productivity. As far as expanding our footprint there, we still have a very robust Eagle Ford inventory position. When I think about the Eagle Ford position we\u2019ve talked about 7,000 locations and being approximately halfway drilled through those locations. So still well over 10 years worth of inventory to drill on. The other thing about looking to do A&D in an established basin like that is just going to be the cost of acquisition. We primarily focus our exploration efforts and we always have for the two decades that we\u2019ve been involved in unconventional resources on organic or Greenfield lease acquisitions because that low cost of entry is critically important to providing through cycle value to the shareholders. Those \u2013 the PDP value that you would have to pay for in an established area, or just established acreage prices. Those things stay with you on your books forever. It raises the cost base of the company and is really antithesis to what we\u2019ve been trying to do over the last few years by shifting to premium and now double premium drilling. Tim, would you like to please comment on the tax proposals? Tim Driggers : Sure. Paul, as far as the proposal we\u2019re in the process of reviewing that as is everyone else currently. But specifically looking at the minimum tax proposal, we do not see that is having any detriment to EOGs. We are a full taxpayer already, so as we model it currently, it will have no impact on EOG. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai from Barclays. Jeanine, please go ahead. Jeanine Wai : Hi, thanks for taking our questions. Maybe just following up on Paul\u2019s question there, low cost bolt-ons have always been part of your capital allocation strategy, and we noticed the cash flow statement had about $350 million of that in there. Any color on whether that was primarily blocking and tackling in your active areas, or is that more on the exploration front? Billy Helms : Yes, Jeanine, this is Billy Helms. That particular acquisition is really just an opportunity we found to bolt-on some largely primarily acreage in some of our exploration plays, very little if no production on those plays. And it just is another way that we can continue to add and grow at a low cost our exploration opportunity set that we see in the future of the company. Jeanine Wai : Okay, great. And then maybe just a quick-one on marketing, you talked about \u2013 you\u2019ve got optionality for up to 250,000 barrels a day of brent exposure. You\u2019re not electing that much right now, but we\u2019re looking at your production levels out of the Permian and the Eagle Ford, and so what\u2019s the capacity to increase beyond that 250,000 or maybe to get to that 250,000? And if you were to take on some more exposure on that, is this really looking at things more on the contract side, or are you also securing to, or are you also open to securing more dock space on your own? Thank you. Ezra Yacob : Jeanine, thanks for the question. Good question too as timely. The exports especially for crude oil has been an important component of our marketing strategy, but when you really look just from an industry standpoint too, I mean, refiners in the U.S. are not expanding. I mean, if anything it\u2019s degrading, right? I mean, we\u2019re seeing our market share; you\u2019re seeing refineries shutting down. You\u2019re seeing refiners that are being repurposed and so we had a view going all the way back to 2018 that we wanted to have a significant export position that we could access from multiple plays. And I know one of your questions there was just, how do we think about the Delaware Basin? Or how do we think about the Eagle Ford? And you\u2019re exactly right, that was all in our contracting that we wanted to be able to have a large position that we could access from both of those plays. So if you think about it today, we have that 250,000 and yes, that facility is expandable. But we have 5 million barrels of storage. I mean, we can segregate WTL, WTI; we can segregate our Eagle Ford. I mean, we are in a premier position as we think about from a low cost and being in early with our tankage position and then also with the capacity that we have out of the Delaware Basin from a transport position and also from the Eagle Ford. So what I would say is we can \u2013 we can transact very quickly. We have tankage that\u2019s in place, and so if we feel the need that we needed to push more across, that\u2019s absolutely something that we could do. Jeanine Wai : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Neil, please go ahead. Neil Mehta : Hey, good morning Ezra and team. Just one question for me, it\u2019s just \u2013 can you give us the lay of the land of how the Dorado program is shaking up \u2013 shaping up and how do you think about the net asset as we go into next year from a planning perspective, but as we continue to see the gas curve is firmed up here? How do you think Dorado can fit into the overall U.S. gas picture? Thank you. Ken Boedeker : Yes. Neil, this is Ken. At this time we really have two-drilling or executive in the Dorado play. And just to give you a little bit of a background on it, since 2018 we\u2019ve drilled and completed over 30 of our 1,250 premium locations, both in the Austin Chalk and the Eagle Ford and we\u2019ve really made excellent progress on reducing well cost and enhancing our geologic understanding and increasing our well performance. We\u2019ve increased our lateral length and we\u2019re really operationally being able to execute. As far as how 2023 goes, it\u2019s a little early to talk about the 2023 program yet. Obviously we\u2019ll remain disciplined with our investment there. First to make sure that the market needs the gas and second to make sure we\u2019re operationally getting better. We \u2013 one thing to keep in mind is we really don\u2019t need a lot of wells there to grow production significantly given the performance of the wells and their shallow decline rate. Neil Mehta : Thanks Ken. Operator : In the interest of time that is the end of the Q&A session today. So I\u2019ll now hand you over to Mr. Yacob for closing remarks. Ezra Yacob : Yes. We want to thank everyone for participating in the call this morning and thanks to our shareholders for their continued support. We especially want to recognize our employees for their performance this quarter. Our discussion today highlights their focus on making EOG a low cost operator, generating high returns and lowering our environmental footprint each and every year. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir. Tim Driggers : Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures can be found on EOG's website. This conference call also may include estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Billy Helms, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Jeff Leitzell, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor Relations. Here's Ezra. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. The quality of EOG's diverse multi-basin portfolio of high-return assets continues to grow and improve. Yesterday's announcement of the large position we captured in the Utica Combo play demonstrates yet again that EOG's robust exploration pipeline delivers results. Over the last two years, our organic exploration efforts have brought forth Dorado, our premium dry natural gas play in South Texas, the emerging Northern Powder River Basin oil play in Wyoming and now the emerging Utica Combo play in Ohio. The value of our multi-basin portfolio can't be overstated. With the addition of the Utica Combo, we are now positioned to operate 7 premium resource basins, which reinforces several of EOG's competitive advantages. First, our decentralized cross-functional operating teams innovate independently, but collaborate to compound the impact of learnings and efficiencies across the company. Second, our flexibility to allocate capital optimizes reinvestment across our portfolio, enabling us to develop each asset at the right pace to maximize returns. And third, our geographic and product diversity gives us the ability to plan around basin-level market dynamics. Our goal is to expand and improve the overall quality of our portfolio by identifying higher return inventory. Our approach is to build a diverse portfolio of premium assets predominantly through low-cost organic exploration, which adds reserves at lower finding and development costs and lowers the overall cost basis of the company. The end result is continuous improvement to EOG's company-wide capital efficiency. Our track record of successful exploration, coupled with strong operational execution, is how EOG has continued to improve over time and position the company to create shareholder value through industry cycles. We demonstrated our confidence in EOG's improving cost structure yesterday by increasing the regular dividend 10%. Our peer-leading annualized dividend is now $3.30 per share, competitive with the broad market. We also delivered on our commitment to return at least 60% of annual free cash flow to shareholders with our fourth special dividend of the year. By year-end, we will have returned $5.80 per share of special dividends. Combined with the regular dividend, we will return $8.80 per share or $5.1 billion in cash to shareholders, which exceeds our 60% cash return commitment using current forecasts. Looking forward, we expect 2023 will remain dynamic with respect to the supply chain, oil and gas prices and other global macro drivers. Our diverse low-cost asset base puts us in an excellent position to capitalize on opportunities no matter the environment. EOG continues to consistently execute, lower our cost structure through innovation and efficiencies and grow the quality of our portfolio to improve capital efficiency and free cash flow potential. Our transparent cash return strategy is anchored to a sustainable, growing regular dividend and backstopped by an impeccable balance sheet. EOG is in a better position than ever to deliver value for our shareholders through industry cycles and play a leading role in the long-term future of energy. Next up is Billy with an early look at our 2023 plan, followed by Tim, who will review our financial performance. Ken will then provide background and details on the Utica Combo play. Here's Billy. Billy Helms : Thanks, Ezra. Once again, EOG delivered outstanding results in the third quarter. We exceeded midpoint of production guidance, while capital expenditures beat forecasted targets. I'd like to thank our employees for their perseverance and execution to beat the expectations. Realized oil and natural gas prices also beat their target benchmarks in the third quarter. Our marketing teams are doing an excellent job executing our long-term strategy of diversifying across multiple transportation outlets and sales points. This strategy is also enabling the company to navigate the recent bottlenecks, transporting natural gas out of the Permian. We hold a significant transport position with the ability to move up to a Bcf a day out of the basin. In total, less than 5% of our domestic gas production is exposed to WAHA pricing in the Permian. In fact, we anticipate fourth quarter realized prices to remain strong for both natural gas and crude oil sales overall. Our crude oil and natural gas export capacity is serving us well in this regard. In the fourth quarter, we expect to sell over 250,000 barrels of crude oil per day at Brent length prices and 140,000 MMBtu per day of natural gas at JKM-linked prices, both on a gross basis. Year-to-date through September, export-based pricing of crude oil and natural gas has added nearly $700 million of revenue uplift compared to the alternative domestic sales. One of the major topics of the year continues to be the inflation story. The price pressure we are seeing on steel, fuel and labor continues to be persistent. Our employees are maintaining their focus on finding ways to mitigate inflation through innovation and efficiencies in our operations. Through their efforts, we now expect our average well cost to increase a modest 7% as compared to last year. As a result, we have narrowed our full year capital guidance to $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion. Given the elevated and persistent inflation pressures we have experienced this year, I am proud of our employees' efforts to mitigate a majority of this impact to our capital plan. We continue to evaluate and shape our plans for 2023. Production growth and infrastructure investments will remain guided by capital discipline. We expect low single-digit oil growth similar to this year. We currently forecast oil equivalent growth, including gas and liquids, at a low double-digit rate, somewhat higher than this year, largely driven by increased activity in our highly productive dry gas play. Once again, we plan to leverage our activity across multiple basins to secure services and manage cost pressures. Our initial plan includes a modest increase in activity, utilizing on the order of 28 to 30 drilling rigs, including one offshore rig in Trinidad. This would be accompanied by 8 to 10 frac fleets. This would represent a slight increase of 2 to 3 rigs and 1 to 2 frac fleets over 2022 activity levels. We are seeing opportunities in different basins to lock in services at favorable rates for next year and currently expect to secure 50% to 60% of our well cost by the start of the year. This is within our typical range and compares with 50% of costs incurred for the start of 2022. All in all, we expect higher CapEx in 2023, driven by four key factors. First, we are assuming that persistent inflation pressure continues. With the cost of materials and services increasing, our initial 2023 budget is likely to reflect another 10% well cost increase, on top of the 7% increase we expect this year. We will continue to work to identify additional savings and efficiency improvements to offset the impact of inflation, just as we did this year. Second, we see several opportunities to advance development of particular assets in our portfolio in areas that are less exposed to the most severe inflation and supply chain pressures. The increase in activity in emerging plays like Dorado, the Powder River Basin and the Utica Combo are examples. Third, we expect to accelerate some infrastructure projects to take advantage of market opportunities. In Dorado, we've begun construction of a new 36-inch gas pipeline from the field to the Agua Dolce sales point near Corpus Christi, Texas. This will ensure long-term takeaway, fully capture the value chain from the wellhead to the market center and aligns with our focus on being a low-cost operator. Fourth, we plan to continue to progress our investments in environmental projects, including expansion of our carbon capture and storage or CCS projects. Our first CCS project is progressing, and we expect to begin injecting CO2 early next year. This is yet another step toward our goal of being among the lowest-cost, highest-return and lowest-emission producers of oil and natural gas. We recently released our latest sustainability report for 2021, which highlights our progress. We achieved our near-term 2025 methane emissions percentage target of 0.06% last year, an 85% reduction from 2017 levels. We captured 99.8% of natural gas produced at the wellhead, meeting our 2021 gas capture target. We discussed our latest initiative to further reduce methane emissions through our continuous leak detection system named iSense. We improved our safety performance with lower total recordable and lost time incident rates, and we reduced our freshwater intensity rate by 55% since 2020. We are proud of our employees' progress on our sustainability goals, but we still see tremendous opportunities for continued improvements. Altogether, infrastructure spending, including environmental projects, typically amounts to 15% to 20% of our CapEx budget. This year is running right about the midpoint of that range; whereas next year, we expect it to be towards the higher end of that range. We continue to develop our 2023 plans as we approach the new year and provide a more detailed complete outlook in February. Now here's Tim to discuss our financials. Tim Driggers : Thanks, Billy. We are very pleased to increase the regular dividend by 10% to $3.30 per share annual rate. This increase reflects two things. First, the improvements we've made to the cost structure. Efficiencies and technology continue to sustainably improve EOG's capital efficiency. Furthermore, we expect the advantages of operating in multiple basins will drive additional improvements to EOG's cost structure and returns in the year ahead, lower the cost of supply and lower the breakeven oil price to fund the dividend. Second, this dividend increase reflects our confidence in EOG's expanding portfolio of premium plays to grow the company's future income and free cash flow potential. Over the last several years, our success in organic exploration continues to add low-cost reserves and consistently drive down our DD&A rate, enabling EOG to create value through industry cycles. We also remain committed to returning at least 60% of free cash flow to shareholders each year. As a reminder, we look at this on an annual basis, not quarter-to-quarter. Based on current commodity prices, we estimate the $1.50 special dividend declared yesterday will bring free cash flow return to shareholders to about 67% for 2022. We will start 2023 in an exceptionally strong financial position. We ended the third quarter with $5.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet against $5.1 billion of debt. We generated $2.3 billion of free cash flow during the quarter, along with inflows of another $1.3 billion of cash from working capital, primarily from the drawdown of hedge collateral. Now here's Ken. Ken Boedeker : Thanks, Tim. We're excited to announce our new oil and natural gas combo acreage position in Ohio's Utica Shale. We've accumulated 395,000 acres in this play, predominantly in the volatile oil window across a 140-mile trend running north to south. Our cost of entry was less than $600 per net acre for leasehold, demonstrating the benefit of organic exploration, one of our most distinct competitive advantages. Capturing highly productive rock through our organic exploration and leasing efforts is the primary way of improving the quality of our premium inventory at low cost, which leads to a lower company-wide cost basis. The Utica is a well-known and prolific gas resource to the east of our acreage. Several years ago, our exploration team operating out of the Oklahoma City office took a fresh look at the basin from a petroleum system perspective. We knew there was an oil rim with varying gas to oil ratios present. Using our experience in other basins and our technical workflows and proprietary reservoir engineering modeling tools, we anticipated that this could be an area that would be additive to our inventory. When we considered our advancements in precision targeting and simulation technology, along with our low-cost drilling and completion operations, it became clear that this area had the potential to compete with our premium and double-premium plays across the company. Through leasing and acquisitions, we acquired 18 legacy wells with varying geologic and production data, which supported our assessment of the area. Over the last 12 months, we've confirmed our model and the economic viability of this prospect by drilling 3 delineation wells in the northern part of our acreage and 1 in the South. These first 4 wells already earned premium and double-premium returns when normalized to our development plan, which assumes 3-mile laterals. As a reminder, our premium hurdle rate assumes $40 oil, $16 NGLs and $2.50 natural gas. These exceptional results are due primarily to the high productivity of the interval and the large amount of liquids in the product mix from the volatile oil window. In addition to the well performance, we also want to highlight our embedded mineral interest in the southern portion of the acreage. We've acquired 100% of the mineral rights across 135,000 acres of our leasehold for about $1,800 per acre, which is in addition to the $600 per net acre for the leases. This mineral interest significantly enhances the value of this play by adding 25% to our production and reserve strain from no additional well cost or operating expense. This area is also where we've drilled our most prolific well, which has initially produced over 2,500 barrels of oil per day and 3,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a 12,000-foot lateral. The total value of this mineral interest across our southern development area is significant, especially since EOG will dictate the pace of development as operator. Next year, we plan to drill approximately 20 wells in the northern and southern areas and utilize our multi-basin experience to climb the learning curve faster by leaning on the best targeting, drilling and completion techniques that apply to this area. We expect our 2023 Utica Combo plan will accomplish 2 goals : first, to deliver double premium returns; while second, further delineating the play to help assess resource and inventory. We will invest in incremental gathering infrastructure to prepare for a larger development program and anticipate being able to take advantage of existing processing infrastructure in the area for the foreseeable future. This is the advantage of the timing and economic efficiency of successfully unlocking potential in an existing basin. EOG's entry into the Utica Combo play is a textbook example of why our decentralized organization that operates in multiple basins with wide-ranging geology lends itself to successful additions to the upper end of our premium and double-premium inventory. We applied what we learned over the past decade in developing our portfolio to identify and unlock this overlooked resource. Now here's Ezra to wrap things up. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Ken. The takeaway from today's call are centered on EOG's fundamental value proposition. First, EOG's multi-basin organic exploration focus continues to improve the quality of our inventory, Capturing Tier 1 acreage across multiple high-return opportunities provides geographic diversity, product diversity and the flexibility to allocate capital across each asset at the correct pace to optimize returns. Second, EOG is a low-cost operator. We use technology to increase operational efficiency and capture select pieces of the value chain to keep both capital and operating costs low, thereby helping to reduce our breakevens and increase our free cash flow and income-generating potential. Third, Tim highlighted our financial performance and commitment to financial discipline that results in a 10% increase to our peer-leading regular dividend, a commitment to additional cash return with our announced special dividends and a best-in-class balance sheet. Fourth, our recently published sustainability report illustrates our progress to reach near-term greenhouse gas and methane emissions intensity goals and our commitment to develop new technologies and pilot new projects, such as our CCS project, to help reduce our environmental footprint. And fifth, it is EOG's employees and unique culture that continues to drive our success. Thanks for listening. We'll now go to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann. You may proceed. Neal Dingmann : Congratulations for some nice results. My first question is on, to jump right to it, the Utica Combo play. Specifically, looking at that Slide 10 of years, it appears, and you talked about this -- some of you guys talked about this already, that the primary folks looks like it's on that volatile oil section or window. Just wondering, have you identified this is sort of how the economics look in this window and sort of why focus here? And secondly, maybe just talk about the takeaway situation for you all there. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Neal, this is Ezra. Thanks for the question. I'll maybe make a couple of comments and then hand it to Ken to shed a little more light on the economics and then Lance will provide a little more commentary on the takeaway. But when we think about this basin, it's been a bit of a sleepy basin. Everyone knew that there's a liquids window there, obviously, and it hasn't really been revisited in a number of years. As part of our recent exploration efforts, we went back in, really applied, as Ken said, some of our data from outside from other basins, some of the things that we've learned in the past few years. We really evaluated it from a geologic level, looking at the way that the process manifests itself between the north and the south, the mechanical stratigraphy that we've talked about before, how our completions interact with the rock. We had better data to better define the GOR and the phase across this area. And then really, we made a lot of progress modeling the overpressure across the play. And when you combine that, obviously, with technology on the operational side, that's what gets us so excited about the opportunity here. And it's really almost reminiscent of what we saw nearly a decade ago happening in the Delaware Basin, where it's a bit of a sleepy basin with a lot of show wells. It really required some industry and EOG technology and knowledge kind of brought in from the outside to really make things work. Ken, do you want to talk a little more about the wells? Ken Boedeker : Sure. As Ezra mentioned, we are in the volatile oil window. And we do expect oil, gas and NGL production will vary some across that window both from north to south, but more so from east, which will have a higher gas cut to west, which is oilier. On an ultimate recovery basis, we expect that there will be 25% to 35% oil and similar percentages for natural gas liquids and residue gas. So when you think about that, this play is really focused on the 60% to 70% liquids development. And from that, as far as the economics go, it gives us premium and double-premium numbers. That's $40 oil, $16 NGL and $2.50 gas. The other thing to note on these wells is it's early, but we are expecting, depending on where we're at in the play, 2 million to 3 million barrels of oil equivalent for an EUR with a 3-mile lateral. So that type of performance really leads us to a low finding cost and it will definitely be additive to our cost basis. Lance Terveen : Neal, this is Lance. I'll comment a little bit for you. I'll start at a high level, too, and maybe kind of drill down for you just as you think about kind of infrastructure and also take away. But really, when we think about our plan, it's going to follow the same strategy that we've done in all of our plays. And I mean, one, marketing is always aligned and integrated upfront in all of our exploration efforts. You've heard us many times talk about just multiple connections is critical. We want to have control to market. And then firm offtake, we're always disciplined in that matter that is going to be very commensurate with our plans. But when you think about the nat gas and especially like evacuating the nat gas, you got to remember like Ken just highlighted, the Utica wells will have less gas volumes in the oil window. It's a liquids-rich play, like Ken highlighted, 60% to 70% liquids. So when we look out here, we look upfront, there is significant available capacity that's just adjacent to our play. And also, if you remember, it's been built out for a long time. Much of it has been overbuilt, I would say, like in the last 10 years. So this also allows for opportunities. So we've really aligned ourselves with the current midstream operators that are in the area, very strong. We have great relationships with those. We've developed strategic relationships into the interstate pipelines, too, at the plant tail gates. And I can tell you the liquidity is very strong in this area. It's much different than you can look into the Marcellus. But when you get into this area, liquidity is very strong. And so we don't see any issues at this time with sales on a go-forward basis. Neal Dingmann : That's fantastic details, guys. It's great people to you coming back there. My second question, maybe just a bit on capital allocation, specifically, I realize you won't have detailed '23 guide for a few more months. I'm just wondering if you all have talked a bit -- I think, on the plan talked today about maybe a bit more activity next year. I'm just wondering, is that just to keep production stable? Or are you still kind of considering a maintenance plan next year? And I'm wondering if you would consider a bit more growth if prices continue to be as strong and maybe costs would back off a little bit? Billy Helms : Yes, Neal, this is Billy Helms. Like we had said in the prepared remarks there, it's still early to talk about what we think 2023 actual specifics will be. But in the prepared comments, I also mentioned the fact that we will have more activity. We do anticipate growing our oil production somewhere in the -- similar to this year, somewhere in the low single digits. And on the equivalent growth, it will be probably in the low double digits. So that's kind of how we see the plan shaping up as we -- as today with the macro environment we see today. That would company -- that would entail probably adding 2 to 3 rigs over and above this year's activity level in general with probably another 1 to 2 frac fleets. So it kind of gives you an outlook of what that might look like. So I guess maybe just to scale it up on the CapEx side, we kind of give you some guidance this quarter for what we think our CapEx burn rate will be. And if you kind of normalize that through next year and then add the cost of a little bit more activity and some infrastructure costs to kind of get you directionally where we're thinking. Operator : The next question comes from Leo Mariani. You may proceed. Leo Mariani : I wanted to dig a little bit more into the Utica. You all talked about a well that had a 2,500 barrel a day rate. I guess it was 3,500 on an equivalent basis to the south. I just wanted to clarify, is that like a 24-hour rate? Is that more of a 30-day rate? And then also, I guess that's 1 of the 4 wells. Can you perhaps provide a little bit of color around the other three in the basin there as well? And you talked about kind of 2 million to 3 million BOEs recoverable on a 3-mile lateral. Can you also help us out with maybe what you think the eventual targeted well cost would be there, that 3-mile lateral? Ken Boedeker : Yes, Leo, this is Ken. As far as that 2,500 barrel a day rate that we highlighted there, we produced that for a couple of weeks. So we're very comfortable with that rate. As far as the other 4 wells go, they had varying lateral lengths. We can move those to a 3-mile -- when we move those to a 3-mile development plan, they're definitely double-premium-type economics. That 2,500 barrel a day well that's got the 12,000-foot lateral is the longest lateral we've drilled to date. The others do have a shorter lateral as we drilled them. One thing I really wanted to highlight on that 12,000-foot lateral well is the operations team that we have at Coloma City. It was the longest well that we've drilled. And once they got into the lateral, they drilled that 12,000 feet in a little over 6 days and stayed 99% in an 8-foot target. So just outstanding operational performance there. As far as well costs go, we've really just highlighted that we anticipate being less than $5 a barrel on the F&D cost. Leo Mariani : I wanted to follow up a little bit on Dorado. So you all mentioned that you're constructing a 36-inch pipe. That's obviously a pretty good-sized pipe. So it sounds like you've got some pretty grand plans for that play, and it sounds like it's driving a lot of growth in 2023. Just curious as to when you think that pipe is going to be ready and imagine it's going to take a little while to get constructed, and perhaps there's an even kind of larger wave of growth out of Dorado as we get towards mid-decade. And I'm assuming that maybe there's some LNG-type ambitions associated with that. So any color would be great. Billy Helms : Yes, Leo, this is Billy Helms. Let me maybe start with the answer, and then maybe Lance can give some more color on it. So the 36-inch pipeline, yes, it's an effort to try to not only get that gas to market, but also make sure we continued our focus on keeping our cost as an operator low. So that's part of our longer-term plan. We've recognized that the value of installing infrastructure is really helping lower the long-term cost basis of the company. And so this is just another step in that vein. The 36-inch pipe will be constructed over a couple of years, so it's not all being done in 1 single year. It's important to be taking it to the market center where we are. And then the LNG that we certainly recognize the value of having the gas in this area. It's in South Texas, where all the LNG demand is, so it's advantage from that standpoint. So that's kind of how this kind of works into the overall market dynamics with this play. So I'll let Lance maybe add a little bit more color on the pipeline itself and the market. Lance Terveen : Yes, sure. Leo, it's Lance. I think ride add on to what Billy talked about as well. It's just it is very complementary and it's an integration of our operations. But again, like you heard in one of my answers earlier, the controllable market is very important. And so as we build out this infrastructure into the Agua Dulce market, we will have -- we're anticipating 4 downstream market connections. And I know you kind of asked a little bit about LNG, but I think the bigger point is just the demand pool that's anticipated out of South Texas. There could be up to 5 Bcf a day just from kind of the South Texas region when you think about power gen, industrial load and also in Mexico. And the demand pool is really real, right? You've heard us talk about Corpus Christi Stage 3. We're going to have a 720,000 MMBtu day sale once that's kind of in service. We got the 140,000, that's today. But you also have Golden Pass that's under construction and several other facilities that are getting very, very close to FID, which is excellent. And so maybe one other thing to add is that we've also contracted for a large transport position on an interstate pipeline expansion, allowing us to reach essentially all the LNG demand pool along the Gulf Coast from South Texas to Louisiana, and that will have a direct connection off of our 36-inch. So we're thinking very tactically, strategically and setting up Dorado for the long term. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate. You may proceed. Doug Leggate : I wonder if I could jump on the Utica as well. I'm just curious about, I guess, the back story as to how you accumulate this position because there's clearly a lot of players, I guess, a little east of you guys, some of which might have characterized their acreage as noncore. I know M&A is not your bailiwick typically, but a little background as to how you establish this position and whether you'd be looking to continue to expand it. And I've got a follow-up on that, please. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Doug, this is Ezra. Thanks for the question. Like anything, we allowed the -- our geologic model to kind of drive where we are interested in acquiring acreage. We were able to get in there and put it together in a variety of different ways. Probably the most noticeable one is that we were able to purchase the minerals down to the south that Ken highlighted earlier. It's about 135,000 acres of minerals that we purchased as part of transaction. But in general, I'd say it fell right in line with our strategy of identifying where we want to be in the basin, trying to capture Tier 1 and Tier 2 acreage countercyclically, if you will, so we can continue to have a low cost of entry which, of course, is critical is not only as you get out and delineate the plays, but also obviously, as you really think about full cycle economics in these resource plays. Doug Leggate : I know it's -- you guys have typically been organic in the way you report these things. But my follow-up is really about capital allocation. And I guess a follow-up to Leo's question about the Dorado, the pipeline you're building. Now you've obviously taken a, I guess, you could see another step back to gas with Utica. What is your thinking in terms of -- is this a pivot back to gas in terms of how you should think about capital allocation? I know you're typically agnostic on that. I'm just curious if we're seeing a bit of a pivot back here. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Doug. The short answer is that we're agnostic based on our premium price deck, the $40 and $2.50 natural gas pricing that we use to measure our investments. But in general, I'd say we do have a bullish view long term on natural gas and NGLs, obviously, on oil as well. But specific to Dorado and some of these combo plays, we're seeing natural gas. We think we'll continue to see increased demand from power gen, some of the coal switching that we've seen this year. And also, it's going to have, in the upcoming years, continued exposure to the international markets with LNG development there along the Gulf Coast. NGLs obviously span the entire broad spectrum of the economy, from plastics and rubber to heating to fuel blending and so on. And that's not to say those two won't experience volatility at times where supply is potentially outpacing demand. And likewise, demand is -- could be outpacing supply. But that comes back to our approach as a disciplined operator. First, we evaluate, like we just talked about, based on the premium price deck that we use internally, and that means that we're investing based on returns first and foremost. Second, we evaluate that macro supply and demand fundamentals for short-, medium- and long-term signals. And I'd say it's one reason we are excited about the way we enter some of these positions, especially the Utica, by owning the 135,000 acres with the minerals, we can control the pace of development. And the remaining leasehold in that play is dominantly held by production. And so that, again, is another lever that allows us to really optimize our pace of development and investment. Doug Leggate : We'll look for news at the end of the month. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber. You may proceed. Scott Gruber : Congrats on the organic resource play addition. Generally, what's the rough split of the Utica acreage that's prospective for double premium versus single premium? And generally, what spacing assumption are you guys using across the acreage? Ken Boedeker : Yes, Scott, this is Ken. As far as the split, it's really early in the development of the Utica. We have 4 wells in it. We want to do some additional drilling and testing across the acreage before we really come up with some kind of a resource or a well count or a well spacing estimate. As far as premium versus double premium, we actually think that we have double premium potential across the entire acreage position. So we're really just excited about the play and look forward to developing it next year. Scott Gruber : And just ask on the capital allocation question, just over the medium to longer term, how are you thinking about ramping the Utica? It's a little bit further down on your kind of development curve. And obviously, you have optionality in Dorado and PRB, which just relative to the younger plays that you'll be ramping up, how do you think the Utica fits in? Billy Helms : Well, as Ken -- this is Billy. As Ken just mentioned, the Utica, we're very excited about the potential of the play to be double premium. And so it definitely competes on a capital allocation standpoint. But we are early in the play. So as we see things today, we'll plan on drilling somewhere in the order of 20 wells next year and then from that determine on how what the go-forward plan looks like. As far as capital allocation for next year, we're still early and still developing our plans. But as we see things today, the benefit of having these multiple basins is it gives us a lot of flexibility to move capital between the different basins. We don't have to leverage all of our activity in one basin. In particular, we're going to try to keep from seeing a lot of activity increases in areas where we're seeing the most inflation and supply chain constraints that exist mostly in the Permian Basin today. So I would expect our activity levels there to remain pretty consistent with what we're doing today. We can pull levers in the other plays to meet whatever objectives we set forth as we move towards the end of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade. You may proceed. Charles Meade : I'd like to ask about these 4 wells that you drilled in the Utica. Can you talk about what you did differently, perhaps, from previous operators, whether it's targeting of a zone or your completion design? And also perhaps, did you test different concepts across those 4 wells? Ken Boedeker : Yes, Charles, this is Ken. As far as what we've done differently in this area, it really has to do with having a number of years of experience in all of our other basins that we can bring to bear here in the Utica. If you think about it, it boils down to 4 main things. One of them is targeting, being able to identify the target across the acreage position. The other one is understanding the phase, looking at that phase, not getting into the gas window and not getting too far into the black oil window. The third one is pressure and how that pressure varies across our acreage position. And then the other is the operational execution that we can bring. That's both the drilling and the completion's design that we see. That all rolls into what I would call the geomechanics. And when you roll all that together, it really gives us confidence in that area that we'll be able to develop that with that low finding cost and then double-premium returns basis. Charles Meade : And 20 wells next year, that looks like it's -- maybe should we be thinking about 2 rigs with -- since it might take a while to drill these 3-mile laterals in an overpressure setting? Ken Boedeker : Yes, Charles. Really, right now, these wells aren't taking that long. The 20-well program would really be done with 1 rig at this point in time. We may end up having 2 rigs if they're available at some point and then not at another time, but the average would be 1 rig for next year. . Operator : The next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett You may proceed. Bob Brackett : Had a higher-level question, and then I'll get to nitty-gritty on the Utica. The higher-level question is you all, versus your peers, have run a fairly aggressive exploration budget this year, call it, $450 million or so. What are your thoughts for 2023 and beyond at keeping the scale of that exploration budget given that it's yielding results? Ezra Yacob : Bob, this is Ezra. Yes, this year, you're right, we've -- as we talked at the beginning of this year, we had a number of different exploration plays at a number of different places and evaluation. This year, we're drilling some initial wells, kind of wild cats in the play. Some of the plays are a bit further along and we're trying to delineate because remember, our exploration program, it's not really about producers and dry holes. It's really about how or if these prospects are going to be additive to the quality of our existing inventory. That's what we're really looking for here. Depending on how you bucketize the 20 wells we're talking about here in Point Pleasant is probably the most important thing. It's -- it will basically be another delineation type of year for us across the 400,000-acre position that we've put together. Outside of those 20 wells, that will be the biggest part of next year's kind of exploration delineation type of program, if I'd put it there. We have some ongoing prospects in other areas that we've talked about in the past. Some of those other ones, again, extend similar types of areas, places that have been sleepy in the past, places that are in known oil and natural gas producing areas, places where we're trying to bring modern technology, our advancement of horizontal drilling and completions technologies and combining them with our rock, the understanding of the geologic environment and seen if we can turn those into premium and double premium types of plays, it would be additive to us. And we'll just continue to evaluate as they go. To give you a hard number right now, though, it's just a little bit early, as Billy said, but we'll break that out in February. Bob Brackett : Very clear. And then kind of a bit nitty-gritty. You mentioned the importance of targeting. You mentioned staying in an 8-foot zone. Is it a stretch to say the secret sauce here is staying in the Point Pleasant? Ken Boedeker : No, I mean, Bob, this is Ken. We do stay in the Point Pleasant. I think the secret sauce here is really a combination of everything. It's a combination of what we've learned in our other plays and then being able to operationally perform on that. So getting the right petrophysical model to understand that targeting and understand how that targeting varies across the area, and then looking at the 8-foot window that we've kept it in really speaks to being able to perform. This really goes back to just our culture. It really is about the people, and it's about our ability to always attempt to get better, to work on getting better and try to make the next well better than the last. So you put all that together, and that really is the secret sauce for our entire company, let alone our exploration effort. Bob Brackett : It's clear. And I'll just sneak in a third one, and I apologize. You mentioned the importance of pressure. In the old days, reservoir energy in the Utica was always something that was a challenge. How have you overcome that? And is there maybe a different artificial lift strategy out there to keep that tail producing? Ken Boedeker : Yes, Bob, I think that's why we're in the volatile oil window. We have enough gas in the volatile oil window to help us lift our wells. At this point in time, we don't see that we'll need much artificial lift through the life of these wells. It's being right on that the right portion of that phase window. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai. You may proceed. Jeanine Wai : Our first question, maybe just following up on Bob's question here. You've disclosed 7 premium operating basins, which is fantastic. The decentralized model has worked very well for EOG so far. But from an organizational perspective, how many basins would be considered too many basins because you're clearly still evaluating other opportunities? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Jeanine, this is Ezra. That's a fantastic question here. It really speaks to what we think is one of our core competitive advantages, and that's the fact that we run a decentralized organization. That's what allows us to kind of cross-pollinate ideas between divisions. In any industry, the success of running a decentralized organization is being able to push decision-making and accountability down to the employees who are kind of touching the wells and closest to the value creation every single day. When you break it up that way and you think about it that way, we have 8 operating teams, and each of those has -- operates as kind of a fully functioning oil company in a lot of ways, if you will. They have a full complement of geologists, engineers, accountants, land mens, marketing people, so on and so forth. Each of these individual asset teams can really handle working across multiple basins. And in fact, to a different type of scale, you see the same type of leverage and benefits that we see at the corporate level is that by exploring in different basins really adds to kind of their understanding. I'll go back to how Ken started this, the Point Pleasant or the Utica play is actually being looked at currently by members of our Oklahoma City team who are quite familiar with the Woodford, the overpressured oil window in the Woodford play. And that play really lended a lot of expertise to our understanding of mechanical stratigraphy. Again, to reference what Ken was talking about on how the rocks actually break and interact with our completion strategy, and that's some of the key characteristics that have helped unlock in a number of our unconventional plays. Jeanine Wai : And then for our second question, in terms of operational momentum, are you able to provide any color on what activity looks like heading into year-end and early '23? We noticed that 4Q oil guidance is flat at the midpoint quarter-over-quarter. CapEx is up, but that sounds to us like it could be timing-related. Billy Helms : Yes, Jeanine, this is Billy Helms. You're exactly right, it's just a timing factor. We're currently running all the rigs that we plan to carry into next year. And we'll start looking at adding rigs in different plays. As we go into next year, based on our outlook for the '23 budget, which will firm up as we get closer to that time. The quarter-over-quarter volume growth is pretty flat, and that's just a function of completing wells late in the quarter that will really roll into next year. And that's going to happen in several different plays, the Permian, probably the Dorado play and a little bit in the Eagle Ford as well. So that's just a function of timing of those completions. Operator : The next question comes from the line of [Kevin MacCurdy]. You may proceed. Unidentified Analyst : And just getting back to the Utica. Trying to do some back-of-the-envelope math on spending there next year. Would a 3-mile lateral cost in the ballpark of around $15 million? And I guess if you did 20 wells, that would kind of put you at around a $300 million spend rate in the Utica next year. And is that kind of the right assumption for rig add next year? Ken Boedeker : Yes, this -- Kevin, this is Ken. What we're talking about now is those are 2 million to 3 million-barrel wells that we've talked about and less than a $5 F&D cost. We really haven't given out a number as far as what our development costs will be because we have some additional testing, and we really do want to drill some of our wells on pads and drill them in packages to see what that ultimate development cost will be. So you can use the $5 F&D in the 2 million to 3 million barrels to get a reasonable estimate for well cost. Unidentified Analyst : And digging in the marketing strategy a little bit in the Utica, I mean, you mentioned that you had plenty of gas takeaway locally. But do you guys have a plan to get that gas out of basin? Just kind of thinking about the knock-on effect if the Utica grows, that might have an impact to Southwest PA basis? And is that of concern for your returns? Lance Terveen : Yes, Kevin, this is Lance Terveen. Thanks for your question. I'd say even like I talked about earlier, like the marketing component of it is integrated very early on. So I mean we recognize the nat gas like realizations are weaker, but still when we look at our overall portfolio and then how the Utica Combo competes, it's very competitive. And so your earlier question was just as it relates when you think about just kind of downstream takeaway in that. Again, it comes to just the liquids focus that we have in anticipation. I think there's some misconception on kind of the gas rates that those are going to look very similar to like the dry gas wells to the east and other competitors that are in the region when we're going to see lower gas rates that are going to come out of our development. And so when we look at that on a go forward and with the relationships that we have with the capacity that we see on the processing side, the gas sales and the takeaway, we're not foreseeing an issue right now. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Anan Naryanin. Neil Mehta : This is Neil Mehta. Can you hear me okay? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Neil, we've got you. Neil Mehta : Okay. I'm sorry about that. Yes, it's Neil Mehta here from Goldman Sachs. So as I had more of a macro question here, which is we haven't seen U.S. oil production, at least in the weekly, move since April of 2022. They've been kind of hanging around this plus/minus 12 million-barrel a day range. And are you surprised that we haven't seen the pickup in U.S. production that a lot of people were anticipating? And I want to tie that into Slide 9 of your deck, which is showing relative maturity of some of the oil plays like the Bakken and increasingly the Eagle Ford and even the Delaware. Are we getting to the point where shale is going to have a tougher time growing and we should be thinking about peak shale production in the United States in the foreseeable future? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Neil, that's a good question. Let me take it one piece at a time here. Since earlier in the year, we've been talking about how we were anticipating a little bit less U.S. growth this year than what many people were forecasting. The reason for that clearly, there's a little bit of inventory exhaustion going on. These basins have been drilled for a number of years. But the biggest thing we based our models on this year was really what we were seeing with again, what's turned into inflationary pressures throughout the year. It's the rig counts, the frac spreads and really the people side of it. There's definitely North American discipline from the E&P sector out here, but there is also a supply chain constraints that have continued to kind of be felt throughout the entire year this year. I do think coming out of the pandemic, we've had a consolidation across the industry, what you've been left. And this is something we've talked about quite a bit, too, is you've been left with less companies and those companies that have the size, the scale, balance sheet, things of that nature to be able to continue to drill and operate. And the majority of those companies are drilling and investing in a way that's more disciplined than what was in favor prior to the pandemic. So I think it's really 3 or 4 different things that have kind of come together to limit U.S. growth. And quite frankly, a lot of those things that I've talked about are not necessarily transitory in nature. Some of these things will really continue into 2023 as well. And so that's why I'd say entering 2023, again, I suspect our forecast on the oil side will probably be a little bit to the low end of many of the numbers that you're seeing out there. Neil Mehta : Yes, that's helpful. And then a follow-up just on the balance sheet. You guys are clearly have a fortress balance sheet position in a net cash position now. Just talk -- remind us again how you're thinking about minimum cash balances? And what is the Pareto optimal capital structure as you think about your leverage profile? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Neil, thank you for bringing that up. It's something that we're exceptionally proud of. We've always said that in a cyclical industry such as ours, the best thing you can have is not just a strong but a real pristine balance sheet. There's never really been a cash target for us, and there's not one now. We're thrilled to be, as you kind of said, in a unique position where we're able to strengthen the balance sheet this year, but at the same time, return just over $5 billion, $5.1 billion to our shareholders. We've -- as far as the ultimate balance sheet, we have a couple of strategic things. We do have a $5 billion buyback authorization. We've talked about using that opportunistically. That's a compelling strategy to go ahead and carry a little more cash on the balance sheet than what we've done historically. But really, the strategy overall for the company is aimed at creating value in the long run and managing the balance sheet to make counter-cyclic investments is a big piece of that. We've talked about having operational and reserve cash just to stay out of commercial paper. But at the end of the day, when we think about it in a cyclical industry, like I said, the balance sheet provides a lot of optionality to create value. We're committed to delivering on our free cash flow priorities, and that's -- it's founded in growing a sustainable regular dividend, but it also contemplates the minimum commitment of 60% of free cash flow. And both of those are supported by having a very strong balance sheet and, just in general, being focused on doing the right thing at the right time to maximize long-term shareholder returns. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now pass the call back over to Mr. Yacob for final remarks. Ezra Yacob : Thank you. We want to thank everyone for participating in the call this morning. And we especially want to thank our employees. They've delivered another outstanding quarter for all of EOG's shareholders. Thank you for listening. Operator : That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

We earned record return on capital employed of 34% and record adjusted net income of $8.1 billion, generated a record $7.6 billion of free cash flow which funded record cash return to shareholders of $5.1 billion. We increased our regular dividend rate 10% and paid four special dividends, paying out 67% of free cash flow, beating our commitment to return a minimum of 60% of annual free cash flow to shareholders. And we strengthened what was already one of the best balance sheets in the industry, reducing net debt by nearly $800 million. We continue to deliver on our free cash flow priorities this year by declaring an additional special dividend of $1 per share yesterday. Outshining our financial results were achievements made by our operating teams working in a challenging inflationary environment. Credit goes to the innovative and entrepreneurial teams working collaboratively across our multi-basin portfolio. Together, we leveraged the flexibility provided by our decentralized structure to deliver exceptional operational performance. Production volumes, CapEx and per unit operating costs were within guidance set at the start of the year. We offset persistent inflationary pressures that exceeded 20% during the year to limit well cost increases to just 7%. Our exploration teams uncovered a new premium play, the Ohio Utica combo, and advanced two emerging plays, the South Texas Toronto and Southern Powder River Basin. We've progressed several exploration prospects including the Northern Powder River Basin. We expanded our LNG agreement, currently estimated to take effect in 2026 to 720,000 MMBtu per day, which will provide JKM-linked pricing optionality for 420,000 MMBtu per day. Last year, the revenue uplift from our current 140,000 MMBtu per day LNG exposure was more than $600 million net to EOG. Preliminary results indicate that we reduced our GHG intensity and methane emissions percentage, achieving our 2025 targets. And we initiated an expanded deployment of our new continuous methane leak detection system called iSense. Led by the tremendous performance in our Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford plays, our operating performance and financial results in 2022 are a reflection of our asset portfolio and the unique organizational structure in place to support it. Seven teams in North America and one international team operates 16 plays across nine basins. Our decentralized structure empowers each operating team to make decisions in real time at the asset level to maximize value. This differentiates EOG and enables us to consistently execute our strategy and produce outstanding results year after year. Our multi-basin portfolio provides numerous high-return investment opportunities and we remain focused on disciplined investment across each of our assets. In addition to our premium well strategy, in which wells must generate a minimum of 30% direct after-tax rate of return at a flat $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas price for the life of the well, we invest at a pace that allows each asset to improve year-over-year, lowering the cost and expanding the margins generated by each asset. Disciplined investment means more than just expanding margins at the top of the cycle. It means delivering value for the life of the resource and through the commodity price cycle. It's not only developing lower-cost reserves, but also investing strategically to lower the operating cost of these resources, which positions EOG to generate full cycle returns competitive with the broad market. Looking ahead to 2023, EOG is in a better position than ever to deliver value for our shareholders and play a significant role in the long-term future of energy. Our ability to reinvest in the business, deliver disciplined growth, lower our emissions intensity, earn high returns, raise the regular dividend and returned significant cash to shareholders, all while maintaining what we believe is the best balance sheet in the industry is due to our differentiated strategy executed consistently year after year. Now, here's Tim to review our financial position. Tim Driggers : Thanks, Ezra. When we established our premium strategy back in 2016, our goal is to reset the cost base of the business to earn economic returns at the bottom of the price cycle. The impact premium has had on the cost basis of the Company and our financial performance has been dramatic. Since 2014, prior to establishing our premium strategy, our DD&A rate has declined 42% and cash operating cost by 23%. Also, in 2014, and under similar oil prices as last year, we earned 15% ROCE. With our lower cost structure, ROCE increased to a record 34% in 2022. We have also reduced net debt last year by $800 million to further strengthen the balance sheet. We view a strong balance sheet as a competitive advantage in a cyclical industry. Our current balance sheet is among the strongest in the energy industry and ranks near the top 20th percentile of the S&P 500 in terms of leverage and liquidity, measured as net debt to EBITDA and cash as a percentage of market cap. We have a $1.25 billion bond maturing in March and intend to pay that off with cash on hand. Our 2023 plan is positioned to generate another year of strong returns. We expect to grow oil volumes by 3% and total production on a BOE basis by 9%. At $80 WTI and $3.25 Henry Hub, we expect to generate about $5.5 billion of free cash flow for nearly 8% yield at the current stock price and produce an ROCE approaching 30%. This attractive financial outlook, along with our strong balance sheet, is what gave us the confidence to declare a $1 per share special dividend to start the year on top of our regular dividend of $0.825 per share. As a reminder, our commitment to return a minimum of 60% of free cash flow considers the full year, not a single quarter in isolation. The special dividend reflects the confidence in our plan and our constructive outlook on oil and gas prices. We will continue to evaluate the amount of cash return as we go through the year with an eye on, once again, meeting or exceeding our full year minimum cash return commitment of 60% of free cash flow. Here's Billy to discuss operations. Billy Helms : Thanks, Tim. I would like to first thank each of our employees for their accomplishments and execution last year. 2022 was a challenging year, and the commitment and dedication of our employees remain steadfast as they delivered outstanding results. Last year can be characterized as a year of heightened inflation where we witnessed increasing commodity prices, accompanied by higher levels of activity across the industry. The result was a much tighter market for services, labor and supplies. We were able to offset most of this inflation through efficiency gains and capital management across our portfolio to limit well cost increases to just 7%. For the full year, oil production was above the midpoint of guidance, while capital expenditures were $4.6 billion, were only 2% above the original guidance midpoint set at the beginning of the year. Our operating teams working throughout the Company leveraged efficiencies to help offset inflation. This is most evident in our core development plays, which sustain sufficient activities to support continued experimentation and innovation. In the Delaware Basin, we expanded use of our Super Zipper completion technique to increase treated lateral feet per day by 24%. In our Eagle Ford play, the completions team increased completed lateral feet per day by 14% and the amount of sand pump per day per fleet by 27%. Our decentralized operations teams are continually striving to improve performance and share learnings across our portfolio to limit well cost increases. These learnings are then deployed in our emerging opportunity plays. For instance, in the Southern Powder River Basin, Mowry play, the drilling team decreased drilling time by 10% with improved bid and drilling motor performance. In our South Texas Dorado gas play, the operations team reduced drilling time by 12%. Through technical and operational advancements, they promise to continue to drive improvements in 2023. Beyond cost reductions, a new completion design implemented last year in the Delaware Basin is realizing positive improvements in well performance in certain target reservoirs. This new design was tested in 26 wells last year and is yielding as much as an 18% uplift and estimated ultimate recovery. We're also making great progress towards our long-term ESG goals. Our wellhead gas capture rate exceeded 99.9% of the gross gas produced. And preliminary results indicate that we lowered GHG intensity and methane emissions percentages in 2022. We now have approximately 95% of our Delaware Basin production covered by iSense, our continuous methane monitoring technology. Now turning to the 2023 plan. We forecast a $6 billion capital program to deliver 3% oil volume growth and 9% total production growth. We expect total volumes on a Boe basis to grow each quarter through the year. First quarter will show more growth in gas versus oil due to the well mix and timing of several Dorado gas wells that were completed late in the fourth quarter of last year. The plan can be summarized in the following four points. First, drilling rig and frac fleet activity in our core development programs, specifically the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford, will be relatively consistent with the fourth quarter of last year. The longer-term outlook for the Eagle Ford is to maintain the current production base where we have over a decade of continued opportunities to generate high returns and cash flow. After a decade of stellar operational improvements in the Eagle Ford, it has become a highly efficient, high-margin play with existing infrastructure and access to favorable markets. In the Powder River Basin, the plan builds off last year's positive well results and infrastructure installation with an additional 20 Mowry completions. We expect to complete a few additional wells in our emerging Utica play in Ohio as we continue to delineate our acreage position and drill a few wells in the Bakken and DJ Basins. In Dorado, our plan is to achieve an activity level that creates economies of scale and develop a continuous program to allow for innovation that drives improved well performance and cost reductions. This results in a moderate increase in activity, completing about 10 additional wells versus last year. In Trinidad, a drilling rig is now scheduled to arrive in the third quarter, which is about a six-month delay. So, international volumes decreased 60 million cubic feet per day or 10,000 Boes per day versus our earlier estimates. Overall, we increased activity in our emerging plays. The average EOG rig count for the year is expected to increase by about two rigs and one additional frac fleet. Second, we have line of sight to efficiencies that we expect will limit additional inflation pressure on well cost to just 10% versus last year. Year-over-year increases in tubular costs as well as day rates for drilling rigs and frac fleets are the main drivers of the increase. As part of our contracting strategy, we stagger our agreements to secure a base line of services and secure consistent execution. For this year, we have locked in about 55% of our well cost, which is a similar level to previous years. Approximately 45% of our drilling rigs and 65% of our frac fleets needed for the year are covered under term agreements with multiple providers. By maintaining this consistent base of services, we expect to find additional opportunities to drive performance improvements and eliminate downtime, thus potentially providing an opportunity to offset some additional inflation. Third, our 2023 capital program includes additional infrastructure investment. Typically, funding for facilities and other infrastructure projects comprises 15% to 20% of the CapEx budget. And this year, we expect that number to be closer to 20%. In Dorado, we commenced construction late last year on a new 36-inch gas pipeline from the field to the Aqua Dolce sales point near Corpus Christi, Texas. This pipeline will help ensure a long-term takeaway, fully capture the value chain from the wellhead to the market center, help support expanded LNG export price exposures due to come online around 2026 and broaden our direct interstate pipeline capacity to reach markets along the entire Gulf Coast corridor. We're also undertaking smaller infrastructure projects in other areas, like the Utica to lower the long-term unit operating cost. Fourth, we plan -- the plan includes capital that represents the next steps towards our vision of being among the lowest emissions producers of oil and natural gas. Our first CCS project has begun injection and we will continue to explore opportunities to enhance our leadership position in environmentally prudent operations. These projects offer healthy returns while also providing reductions in long-life unit operating cost and lower emissions. EOG remains focused on running the business for the long term, generating high returns through disciplined growth, improving our resource base through organic exploration, improving our environmental footprint and investing in projects that will lower the future cost basis of the Company. I am excited about 2023 and the opportunity it brings for our employees to further improve the Company. Now here's Ken to review year-end reserves and provide an inventory update. Ken Boedeker : Thanks, Billy. Our 2022 proved reserve replacement was 244% for finding and development cost of just $5.13 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding revisions due to commodity price changes. Our proved reserve base increased by 490 million barrels of oil equivalent and now totals over 4.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. This represents a 13% increase in reserves year-over-year and was achieved organically. In 2022, we also reduced our finding and development costs by 8% compared to the previous year. In fact, over the past five years, we have reduced finding and development costs by nearly 40%. Our permanent shift to premium drilling, combined with our culture of continuous improvement focused on efficiencies driven by innovation, are why our corporate finding costs and DD&A rate continue to decline. We continue to focus on maximizing the long-term value of our acreage. For example, last year, we continued co-development of up to four Wolfcamp targets. The pursuit of secondary targets with wells developed in packages alongside traditional development benches generally have minimal production impact on the primary zone, however, carry a favorable investment profile because they require no additional leasehold investment, are drilled and completed on existing pads and produced into existing facilities and gathering systems. The goal is to deliver low risk, high returns that maximize the cash return potential of our assets. Looking out beyond our current proved reserves, we've identified over 10 billion-barrel equivalents of future resource potential in our existing premium plays with an expected finding cost -- finding and development costs less than our current DD&A rate. When we invest in finding and development costs less than our DD&A rate, we drive the cost basis of the Company down. When we invested high returns, combined with a low finding and development cost, it shows up in the financials as increased return on capital employed. Thanks to the benefits of our decentralized structure and multi-basin organic exploration strategy, our resource base is growing faster than we do it. More importantly, it is getting better. We have over 10 years of double-premium drilling at the current pace, and we are focused on improving the quality of our resource every year through operational innovation, technical improvements and expiration. Now let me turn the call back to Ezra. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Ken. In conclusion, I'd like to note the following important takeaways. EOG Resources offers a unique value proposition. First, it begins with our multi-basin portfolio of high-return investment opportunities anchored by the industry's most stringent investment hurdle rate or premium price deck. Second, our disciplined growth strategy optimizes investment to support continuous improvement across our portfolio. Our employees utilize technology and innovation to increase efficiencies and allow EOG to remain a low-cost operator. Third, we are focused on generating both near- and long-term free cash flow to fund a sustainably growing regular dividend, support our commitment to return additional free cash flow to shareholders and maintain a pristine balance sheet to provide optionality through the cycles. Fourth, we are focused on safe operations and improving our environmental footprint across each of our assets, utilizing both existing and internally developed technologies. And finally, it's the EOG employees that make it happen. Our culture is at the core of our value proposition and is our ultimate competitive advantage. Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Your line is now open. Paul Cheng : Two questions, please. First, Ezra, with Dorado, how is your investment program changed in many of the changing landscape in the natural gas price? I would imagine, at this point, there's more economic to drill for the oil play than the gas play? How that changed your outlook for the next several years on that play? Second question is on the CapEx. Maybe that it seems like you are investing for the future. So what is the sustaining CapEx requirement to maintain a flat production at this point for your program? And also, if we're looking at, say, for the remainder of this year, is there any area that you think we will start to see some softening in the cost and which may not be reflected in your current budget? Ezra Yacob : Thank you, Paul. This is Ezra. Those are both great questions. So let me start with the first one here on natural gas and what's it looking like right now. You're correct, we've been watching the recent volatility in natural gas, late 2022 and currently associated with the LNG outages and the warm winter that we're experiencing. Our gas growth this next year on the plan, you'll see is about -- at the midpoint is about 240 million cubic feet per day. About 50% of that is coming out of the -- as you mentioned, the associated gas from the Delaware Basin and the other half of it is basically coming out of our Dorado play. Our strategy at Dorado, I'd say, hasn't significantly changed yet. And at this point, we don't really see that it would, barring anything dramatic. And the reason for that is that Dorado always has been kind of a longer-term strategy for us. We've always focused on having moderate investment there to grow into the growing demand center along the Gulf Coast. It's never really been about chasing seasonal demand or aggressively ramping up activities in that play. The U.S., just this year, will have about two Bcf a day of LNG export back online after the disruption's clear. We've got an additional five Bcf a day coming online in kind of the '24, '25 time frame and then potentially another eight Bcf a day still working through financing. And we see this line of sight demand growth is also reflected with the strip price where you see currently, it's moved into contango. So our long-term strategy at Dorado really remains the same. It's investment at a pace where the asset improves each year giving us an ability to drive down both upfront well costs and long-term operating costs, where we can consistently deliver the low cost of supply. This year, as Billy stated, we'll be moving towards a one completion crew program to really capture those efficiencies at Dorado. The first part of your second question, I believe, is on sustaining CapEx. And what I'd say is the sustaining CapEx is a number that we don't necessarily focus on here as an organic growth company. And the reason for that is, even during 2020, we didn't maintain a maintenance capital type of program. We're very dynamic, and we'll grow and we see the ability to invest in our business and the market supports it. And when we don't need to, we can pull back at that time as well. So maintenance CapEx is not necessarily a number that we look at. Now as far as breakevens on our capital program this year, it definitely is up a little bit year-over-year. As Billy mentioned, there's some inflation in there. But also, we're obviously seeing the opportunity to invest in our multi-basin portfolio and increase the CapEx. So, our CapEx program this year is at $44 WTI price with a $3.25 gas price. And I'll maybe hand it over to Billy to give a little bit of color on inflation and where we see it going this year. Billy Helms : Yes, certainly. On the inflation front, I think it's safe to say that everybody has seen commodity prices falling. We've seen inflation rates have peaked and come down. And so we're seeing a lot of the service costs, at least, have plateaued going into this year. And so, as I mentioned on the call, we've got about 55% of our wealth costs secured through existing contracts with our event. And that leaves us the opportunity to capture any upside that we might see in lower rates going into the year. So we're sitting in a fairly good position. I think we're going to be poised and waiting to see what happens and take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves. But I think inflation, at least, is showing that we've plateaued. We baked in about a 10% inflation into our plan. And as we see opportunities, we'll continue to look for ways to improve that. Paul Cheng : Billy, do you see any particular area have the opportunity of softening? Billy Helms : I think what we've seen is one of the biggest drivers this last year on inflation was certainly tubulars casing cost. And I think we've seen different things and different parts of that make up. I think the ERW products is mostly the surface and intermediate casings, those have rolled over and are softening a little bit more than the production casing, which is your seamless products, which are still largely exposed to imports. And so you're seeing some opportunities on casing, but I think there's still yet to come on most of that. On the service side, I think we haven't really seen anything manifested yet, but I think we've all seen rig counts have largely been flat since September, and they're down off their peak of -- in November of probably 20 to 25 rigs. And with the drop in gas prices, I think everybody is expecting maybe we'll see some more softening on the rig activity level. So that may lead to some opportunities to capture some markets. The one advantage that we have, and I'll go ahead and throw this out, we may expand on it later, but the benefit we have is operating in multiple basins. And so we see certainly more service tightness and labor constraints in areas with the most activity, which would be the Permian. But we have the opportunity to shift activity to our other basins to enable those to take advantage of more available equipment, more available capacity to add services at favorable rates. So that's the advantage that we have as a company. Operator : Our next question today comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Arun Jayaram : Ezra, you have a net cash, a balance sheet and if we run through, call it, the $80 case, 55 -- or $5.5 billion in free cash, if you return 60% of that, you're looking at a balance sheet that would be, call it, $3 billion of net cash at year-end. So I wanted to get your views on uses of that cash that you have on the balance sheet and where your heads at in terms of thoughts of increasing cash return to shareholders versus looking at inorganic opportunities, including bolt-ons or M&A? And how do you prioritize some of those opportunities as we think about 2023? Ezra Yacob : It's Ezra. That's a great question. I love talking about our balance sheet and the strength of it. It's something we take a lot of pride in. And the reason for that is because it gives us a lot of optionality at different times, whether it's to look at -- in 2020, we purchased -- strategically purchased a lot of casing. In 2021, we were able to purchase a decent amount of line pipe. And just last year, we were able to make a small acquisition in the Utica play, including purchasing some minerals there. So we're still not looking for any large, expensive, corporate M&As. We do continue to seek out opportunities where it makes sense to do bolt-ons, things that would be accretive, things that could move right into our existing infrastructure and extend some of our lateral lengths. In general, for our net cash position, I would say we don't have a specific target. We do like to have the optionality. The one thing you didn't mention is that we will be retiring a bond here in this first quarter at $1.2 billion. And then, in addition to that, I'd point out that last year, we did move beyond our minimum commitment of that 60% return of free cash flow to our shareholders. Last year, we returned approximately 67%. And so I think you can see -- you can take that as a data point that when appropriate and at the right time and obviously, it's evaluated at the Board level, depending on where we're at within the cycle, where we're at within the year and what our cash position looks like, we have proved that we're willing to move above and beyond the 60% minimum threshold. Arun Jayaram : Great. My follow-up is Ezra, just given the size of the Company, you're approaching 1 million Boes per day in terms of overall output, and most of your activity is short cycle oriented. And I wanted to get your thoughts on exploring longer cycle opportunities. You've seen some of your peers invest in areas such as Alaska and LNG. And I wanted to get your thoughts on EOG looking at the long cycle and perhaps an update on where we stand for -- to drill Beehive in Australia? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Arun, we can start -- yes, maybe with some of our longer cycle stuff. We can start with Trinidad. As Billy mentioned, there has been a bit of a rig delay on our Trinidad drilling program. So that will start about midyear this year. We did set a platform there based -- this past year based on one of the discoveries that we made in 2020. We should start construction on another platform there named Momento later this year, also based on some of the work that we did in that drilling campaign that ended in 2020. So that's on the Trinidad side. In Beehive in Australia, it's our prospect on the Northwest shelf. That prospect has actually slid a little bit. It's now time to be spud in 2024. And then with some of the other projects that you had mentioned, as you can see, and it goes in line with what we were just talking about with the ability of our balance sheet to be strategic and opportunistic. And typically, we do these things counter-cyclically like our agreement on the LNG side, or the ability to put in some infrastructure like we are currently in Dorado to go ahead and lower our operating costs and expand our margins. Those are the type of opportunities that we really look for, things that are in concert with our core business, which is drilling and developing premium oil and natural gas wells. Operator : Our next question today comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Doug Leggate : So Tim, I don't know if this one's for you or for Ezra, but your comments about being able to offset some of the inflation have been a fairly consistent part of your message over the last year. So, I think folks were a little surprised by the CapEx number. So I wonder if you could walk us through the moving parts of whether it be activity led or more specifically, infrastructure related to some of the newer places? There are disproportionate amount of takeaway spending has maybe lifting the CapEx issue. I'm just curious on the breakdown. Billy Helms : Yes, Doug, this is Billy Helms. Let me take a stab at that. So first, there's probably three buckets you can probably put the increase in. First of all, is inflation in our well cost. That's probably a good piece of it, 1/3 of it. It's about -- we're anticipating about a 10% well cost inflation in our program versus last year. And yes, that's maybe 10% over and above last year. But still last year, we achieved only a 7% well cost increase in spite of probably, arguably, 15% or 20% inflation. So I think our teams have done a great job on offsetting inflation with efficiency gains. We're expecting more of that this year, but we've baked in about a 10% cost increase. The second part of that is going to be infrastructure. We've talked about already our Dorado gas pipeline. That's been initiated. And we're also building out some infrastructure in some of our emerging plays, like the Utica to start the testing of those plays. And then we've also included some capital for our ESG projects that we're advancing. So those are kind of the buckets that we look at. And then obviously, we have some additional wells on top of that in these various plays. So as we pick up the two additional rigs and one extra frac fleet, of course, that's going to accompany some additional well count. So those are the three main buckets that I would characterize the increase in the capital versus last year. Doug Leggate : Okay. I appreciate the color, Billy. Thanks for picking that one up. My follow-up is probably for Ezra. And Ezra, forgive me for this one, but I want to take you back to pre-COVID when EOG was growing quickly and frankly, a market didn't need the oil. But you could make the case that today. We've got a market that doesn't need the gas. And I understand your point about maybe trying to take markets, some others are cutting back. But the fact is we still have a largely stranded market in the U.S. Why is this the right time to accelerate your gas production given what is a potentially very constructive outlook longer term? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Doug, that's a good question. Yes, I think the difference is between 2019 or pre-COVID with the oil versus what we're doing in Dorado right now. So like I said, the Dorado volumes are anticipated to support. It's basically the output of a single completion spread program this year. And the benefits that we see of running a consistent program there to learn about this asset, continue to drive down costs, support putting in some infrastructure, things like water takeaway and in-basin gathering, that outweighs the near-term volatility in the gas price because what we see is in a very not-too-distant future, we see a pretty dramatic increase in the offtake and the demand coming on along the Gulf Coast. Now we are backstopped and supported, obviously, with investing on the return side in these premium wells. So we measure the investment on here at a $2.50 natural gas price. And while at today's prices, that's below, we run that $2.50 all the way through the life of the asset. The rest of the gas that we're growing this year is, honestly, as we -- as I said at the top of the Q&A is really associated gas coming out of the Delaware Basin, where the returns there are dominantly driven obviously on the oil and liquids side. And we're really running a maintenance program or a flat activity level program to Q4 across the Delaware Basin. Operator : Our next question today comes from Leo Mariani from MKM Partners. Your line is now open. Leo Mariani : I was hoping you could update us a little bit on maybe some new well results, if there are any from some of the emerging plays. Most interested in hearing about any recent Utica well performance or any Utica wells that may have come on? And then similar, just in the PRB, did get a sense if you've seen improving wells there as well. You've talked a lot about cutting costs in PRB, but just curious as to whether or not some of those wells have seen improvements as you guys have gotten more experience? Ken Boedeker : Yes, Leo, this is Ken. I'll take the Utica portion of that. The four wells we drilled and completed in '22, really continue to deliver our expected performance. And just to give you a flavor on that, we anticipate starting our drilling program for '23 at the end of the first quarter here. One other thing, I would note in the Utica, not on the well side, but on the acreage side is we have added about 10,000 acres of low-cost acreage store position, and we'll continue to look for additional opportunities to add to that position. So we're really excited about the Utica plan for 2023. I'm going to go ahead and give it over to Jeff now for the Powder. Jeff Leitzell : Yes, Leo, this is Jeff. Yes, just a quick update. In 2022, we continue to delineate our acreage there in the Southern Powder River Basin. We completed about 31 net wells across the four primary targets. And all of those, we had excellent results. And we've been shifting our primary focus there, as we've talked about previously to the Mowry. So in 2023, we're going to ramp up the activity a little bit there. We're going to run kind of a consistent two- to three-rig program with one frac fleet. So that will be about 55 net wells. And the majority of those, as we talked about, will be in the Mowry. It's about a 75% increase year-over-year there in the Mowry. And then we'll continue to focus on optimizing that Mowry program there in our Southern Powder River Basin core area. We'll collect a lot of valuable data, and then we'll look to utilize it in the future on our overlying Niobrara formation and then the North Powder River Basin position that we announced earlier on. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. And then just wanted to jump over to the Eagle Ford. If I look at the Eagle Ford, production has kind of been steadily dropping in the last few years. You guys have picked up activity pretty significantly in '23. It looks like roughly 50% more net completions this year versus last. In your prepared comments, you signaled basically trying to kind of keep Eagle Ford flattish for a number of years sort of going forward. Just wanted to get any additional color around that? Eagle Ford had kind of been in decline in favor of other plays, primarily Delaware. And now the plan is to kind of flatten it out. Are you kind of seeing new things there in terms of well productivity or lower costs that have got more encouraged about the play? Just wanted to get a sense because it seems like maybe it's risen slightly in the pecking order here. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Leo, this is Ezra. That's a great pickup. It's a good question because that's exactly what's happened is that it is raising up with respect to the returns and the way they compete for capital. Over the last couple of years, kind of coming out of the pandemic, we've reduced our -- there. And the result of that, we've been trying to right-size the investment. The result has been really back to back years of the highest drilling -- rate of return drilling programs that we've seen in the history of developing that asset. As everybody knows, it's a very high-margin oil play where we've got a lot of infrastructure and a tremendous amount of industry knowledge there. Simply, the asset now is commanding a lot more capital investment this year. We are looking to invest to maintain flat production, as you said. The production has decreased a bit over the last couple of years. And one advantage that we are seeing in the Eagle Ford, and Billy touched on this, and maybe I'll let him add a little more color on it, is really how the inflation and service availability has manifested itself across these different basins and why the Eagle Ford's a bit more attractive. Billy Helms : Sure. As I mentioned earlier in some of the questions, obviously, you see more levels of inflation and more constraints on services in certain fields versus the other, the Permian being the most active play. Certainly, there's a more constraints there on services and labor and those kind of things. So it allows us the opportunity to pick up activity in basins that are seeing less stress, you might say, and Eagle Ford certainly being one of those. On top of that, our team there in Eagle Ford has done just a tremendous job continuing to push innovation and striving for efficiencies such that we continue to make better and better returns in that play with time. And we've kind of reached a point, as Ezra mentioned there, that we want to maintain the constant level of production going forward in that play because we do see more than a decade of running room of continuing to maintain that production level with the opportunities we have in front of us. So we think it's just a good level of production to maintain going forward. Operator : Our next question today comes from Neal Dingmann from Truist. Your line is now open. Neal Dingmann : My first question is on your play detail, specifically, was looking at some other side. I see a couple of years ago, you all suggested you had approximately about 11,000 premium undrilled locations with about, I think, it was nearly 55% of these in the Delaware. Of that Del, about 40% of these will be in Wolfcamp plays. I'm just wondering if that really, number one, total premium locations is still -- I forget what the last number you threw around the premium locations? And wonder if you'd still consider the majority of these in the Wolfcamp portion of the Del? Ken Boedeker : Yes, Neal, this is Ken. I'll take a shot at that. We -- what we talked about earlier, and the way we really look at it, is we have 10 years of double-premium inventory at our current activity level. So locations really aren't a concern for us. What we're really trying to talk about and show is the value proposition of our 10-plus billion Boe resource base that has a finding cost less than our current DD&A rate. Investing in this inventory will use to DD&A and improve earnings and return on capital employed. Our well counts are really constantly changing as our development plans evolve, acreages swapped and laterals are extended. And all those changes improve our finding costs and returns and modify our location count. So what we're really focused on now is lowering our cost basis as we invest at high returns. Neal Dingmann : No, that makes sense. Then maybe Ken just follow up on that. I guess my follow-up is on play details, maybe specifically the Bakken. You all suggested, I think even a couple of years ago, it wasn't a ton of locations, as you said, maybe I don't know if you'd consider a ton of value there. So I'm just wondering how many -- how you'd kind of look at that play today? And would you all consider -- you certainly don't need it financially, but would you consider monetizing it given it appears to be one of your more mature areas? Ken Boedeker : Sure, Neal. The Bakken creates significant returns, and it is one of our highest percentage plays that we have in the Company. So where it's appropriate and when it's appropriate for development, which is we're going to be putting some money into it this year, we'll try to run about a one-rig program there the foreseeable future. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Scott Gruber : So I saw in your supplemental debt that you mentioned that continuous pumping operations are helping to drive completion efficiency in the Delaware. I believe that's one of the benefits you're seeing for running your frac fleet. Is that accurate? And just a bit more detail on how continuous fracking is having completion efficiency above and beyond doing zippers? Billy Helms : Yes, Scott, this is Billy. Yes, we're thrilled with the -- our efficiencies driven through our completion teams. The continuous pumping operation, you're right, is tied to mostly our electric frac fleets. Just a reminder, we've -- we're probably running 60% or 70% of our frac fleets today are electric. And we've been in that business really since about 2015. So, we've been operating more electric frac fleets probably than most of our peers or most of the industry for a long period of time. And through that, we've gained a tremendous amount of knowledge of how to continue to drive efficiencies in that operation. It really has started more in our San Antonio group in the Eagle Ford play, and that's why we're so excited about continuing our investment there. And certainly, we're transferring that information and that those techniques across the Company, including the Delaware Basin. But basically, the continuous pumping operation allows us to minimize any amount of downtime, so we can increase the amount of footage we complete every day, which drives the well cost down over time and allows us to approach some really highly efficient completion strategies. And so, part of that is also leading to improved completion designs, which is allowing us to make better well performance. So overall, it's just one thing that builds on another, and we're excited about the future and where that takes us. Scott Gruber : Got it. And then you also mentioned taking advantage of any softening in -- frac rates if they do manifest this year. How is your contract coverage for both currently following the period of tightness? Would you be able to capture any deflation before year-end? Or would that really benefit more at '24 just given contract coverage? Billy Helms : Our contracts are really staggered, and they don't all roll off at any one given time. Certainly, our well cost is up this year as I mentioned earlier, because some of those contracts have rolled off last year and renewed on those higher day rates and pumping charges this year. But in general, we have about 45% of our drilling rigs secured under term agreements and about 65% of our frac fleets. So that leaves us ample opportunity to capture opportunities if they do present themselves as time moves on. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai from Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeanine Wai : My first question, maybe following up on Leo's question, on the Eagle Ford. In terms of the step-up in activity in the Eagle Ford this year, can you talk about how capital efficiency compared between the overall Delaware and South Texas Eagle Ford? I guess when you pull the well data, the difference in the well performance looks like the Eagle Ford is about 30% lower on a cumulative oil per foot basis over the past couple of years, but that's only one side of the equation, and we realize that. And I think your 3Q disclosure indicated that the Eagle Ford well cost is almost 30% lower on a per foot basis than in the Delaware. So I guess just putting it all together for us, can you just provide some color on how capital efficiency and returns compare between the Eagle Ford and the Delaware? Billy Helms : Yes. Jeanine, this is Billy. Happy to give you some color on that. The Delaware Basin is certainly one of our most capital-efficient plays, quickly followed by the Eagle Ford. The advantage we have in the Eagle Ford is, as I mentioned earlier, the tremendous efficiencies that have been driven in that play. You're right the cum per foot is probably a little bit lower in the Eagle Ford but the well cost is also significantly less. And so we can put a lot more wells to sales in a lot shorter time frame than we can in the Delaware Basin. And then going back to that also, we didn't really feel that we wanted to ramp up activity anymore in the Delaware Basin, but instead leverage on our multi-basin portfolio to increase activity in areas where equipment and crews are more available to leverage into our operation. And so that's what we've chosen to do. But I think the Eagle Ford is still one of our most capital-efficient plays we have in the Company, and we're excited about that opportunity to keep sustaining volume going forward. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Great. Maybe moving to base declines. Can you provide an update on your current base declines given the 3% oil and the 9% Boe growth this year? Do you anticipate that your oil and corporate declines will remain flat or at least -- or maybe even decrease this year? Billy Helms : Yes, Jeanine, this is Billy again. The base declines have been fairly consistent, I would say, year-to-year. And we don't see a measurable change really in our base declines going forward. I think last year was a pretty good year as compared to this year, and I expect the declines would be similar. Operator : Our next question comes from Derrick Whitfield from Stifel. Your line is now open. Derrick Whitfield : With my first question, I'd like to lean into the new completion design you've implemented in Delaware that achieved an 18% AUR uplift. Could you perhaps elaborate on the nature of the enhancement and if it would to be across and outside of the basin? Billy Helms : Yes, Derrick, this is Billy Helms again. On the new completion design, certainly, we're always experimenting with new ideas and trying to innovate as to ways we can improve well performance over time. And we're excited about some of the new advancements and techniques we're experimenting with the Delaware Basin. And to be honest, that's just more color on why we like to get to a consistent program and where we can innovate and experiment and make these improvements. So I'm not going to go into detail about what this new completion design looks like. But certainly, as we continue to advance it, we will translate it to -- import that technology to other basins, and we're already doing so. We were excited about the 18% uplift we've seen, but it's only been done on 26 wells so far in the Delaware Basin. So you can see it's still early on. The amount of the improvement is tremendous though, and we fully expect to be able to transfer that knowledge to other plays. Derrick Whitfield : Perfect. And as my follow-up, perhaps shifting over to the Eagle Ford. We noticed the legacy wet gas position was seemingly reengaged in your supplement update. If I recall, that initial position was in the order of 26,000 acres. Could you perhaps comment on what has brought it back to life and the amount of activity you're expecting over the next couple of years? Ken Boedeker : Yes, Derrick, this is Ken. Yes. Really, what's brought back to life is our people in our San Antonio division, have reviewed it and realized that they could invest at high returns in that area. So we've actually looked at three different zones within that area and drilled three wells last year that had significant returns, and we'll see additional activity this year. I don't know that we've given an exact well count, but it will definitely be stepped up. And really, it's just a matter of having legacy acreage and our people understanding where we think we can make those kind of returns. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Your line is now open. Charles Meade : I want to follow up on Derrick's question, which was a great question. I'd just like to push a little bit further on that Delaware Basin completion design. I understand you don't want to talk about what it is. But as I mentioned, some of the possibilities, I'm curious, is this something that you apply to whatever your maybe fringier intervals that's something that's bringing that -- bringing kind of a lesser interval up to the -- your double-premium threshold? Or alternatively, is this something that you're doing already on -- or is this a new design kind of a meat and potatoes interval that could maybe herald a broader shift hire in your whole Delaware Basin capital efficiency? Billy Helms : Yes. Charles, this is Billy Helms. Yes. The new design is -- really starts with an understanding of the rock we're applying it to. I think we've talked in the past about how all of our designs are tailor made to every wellbore and whatever the geology is telling us is the right application for that. So is it something that we could apply to all zones? I would say probably not, but it's certainly more attractive than other zones. But it is also being done in the core of the play. It's not just applying to the fringe intervals or the fringe of the plays, but some of our core plays or target intervals and we're seeing dramatic improvements. Now it's going to be -- continue to be tailored based on what the geology tells us is the right application, and we'll tweak it and be able to transfer that knowledge as we see it develop. Charles Meade : That's helpful color. And for my follow-up, and I recognize this is a simplification for a company like you guys and your number of rigs and the number of plays. But overall, you indicated that you're going to increase your -- you're going to add three new rig lines in '23. Can you give us a sense where you are in that process? Or when we should expect those in aggregate, the rig count to tick up over the course of '23? Billy Helms : Sure, Charles. The rigs are pretty much in operation today. We started kind of picking up rigs at the end of the fourth quarter going into this year. And as we mentioned, the fourth quarter run rates in the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford will be pretty consistent throughout the year. And so, we've also started drilling in some of the other plays, some of the new emerging plays, such as the Powder River Basin and Dorado. So those are kind of ongoing. We'll be picking up rigs at different times and some of the other plays, like the Bakken or the DJ or the Utica. And those will kind of come and go. Those aren't going to be really, yet full rig lines. They'll kind of ebb and flow based on the timing of each individual play. But the base program is pretty much going to be set, and I'd say the rig count is not going to fluctuate much beyond where it is today. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now hand back over to Mr. Yacob for closing remarks. Ezra Yacob : I'd just like to thank everyone for participating in the call this morning and especially thank our employees for the outstanding results delivered in 2022. Thank you. Operator : That concludes today's EOG Resources Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 results. You may now disconnect your lines.",

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir. Tim Driggers : Thank you and good morning. Thanks for joining us. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG\u2019s SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures can be found on EOG\u2019s website. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC\u2019s reserve reporting guidelines. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Jeff Leitzell, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor Relations. Here is Ezra. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Strong first quarter execution from every operating team across our multi-basin portfolio has positioned the company to deliver exceptional results in 2023. Production, CapEx, cash operating costs and DD&A all beat targets, which underpinned our excellent financial performance during the first quarter. We earned $1.6 billion of adjusted net income and generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow. Free cash flow helped fund year-to-date cash return to shareholders of $1.4 billion through a combination of regular and special dividends, and share repurchases executed during the first quarter. Combined with our full year regular dividend, we have committed to return $2.8 billion to shareholders in 2023 or about 50% of our estimated 2023 free cash flow assuming an $80 oil price. We are well on our way to achieve our target minimum return of 60% of annual free cash flow to shareholders. Our first quarter results demonstrate the value of EOG\u2019s multi-basin portfolio. We have decades of low cost, high return inventory that spans oil, combo and dry natural gas basins throughout the country. Our portfolio includes the Delaware Basin, which remains the largest area of activity in the company and is delivering exceptional returns. After more than a decade of high return drilling, our Eagle Ford asset continues to deliver top tier results while operating at a steady pace. And beyond these core foundational assets, we continue to invest in our emerging Powder River Basin, Ohio Utica Combo and South Texas Dorado plays, which contribute to EOG\u2019s financial performance today, while also laying the groundwork for years of future high return investment. Our portfolio provides flexibility to invest with discipline and develop each asset at a pace that allows it to get better. It provides optionality to actively manage our investments to minimize impacts from inflation. Diversity of our investment portfolio also translates to diverse sales market options, enabling us to pursue the highest netbacks. Our shift to premium drilling several years ago has helped to decouple EOG\u2019s performance from short-term swings in the market. The result is an ability to deliver consistent, operational and financial performance that our shareholders have come to expect and that drives long-term value through the cycle. Recession risk and the near-term demand outlook for oil continues to drive volatility of prices month-to-month. However, our outlook remains positive, inventory levels currently near the five-year average are reducing as we progress through the year, global demand continues to increase and is forecast to reach record levels by year-end and new supply has moderated from pre-pandemic levels of growth. Longer term, with the reduced investment in upstream projects the last several years, we remain constructive on future pricing. For North American gas, near-term prices reflect high inventory levels due to this year\u2019s warm winter and reduced LNG demand during repairs at Freeport. As such, we are currently evaluating options to delay some activity at Dorado. The medium- and long-term outlook for natural gas, however, continues to strengthen. Currently, U.S. LNG demand is at record levels, with an additional 7 Bcf a day capacity under construction or through FID with expected startup between 2024 to 2027 that should position the U.S. as a leader in the global LNG market. Our confidence in the outlook for our business is demonstrated by our capital allocation decisions in the first quarter. Disciplined reinvestment in our high return inventory continues to lower our breakeven and expand the free cash flow potential of EOG. We strengthened our balance sheet by retiring debt, paid out nearly 100% of free cash flow in regular and special dividends, and we utilized our repurchase authorization to buy back $310 million worth of stock late in the quarter during a significant market dislocation. I am confident EOG has the assets, the technology and the people to deliver both return on capital and return of capital for years to come. In a moment, Billy will discuss why we believe our foundational assets in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford will provide higher returns, margins and free cash flow in the years ahead, and why we remain excited about the progress we are making in our emerging assets, Powder River Basin, Ohio Utica Combo and South Texas Dorado. But first, here\u2019s Tim to review our financial position. Tim Driggers : Thanks, Ezra. EOG generated outstanding financial performance in the first quarter. We produced $1.6 billion of adjusted net income or $2.69 per share and $1.1 billion of free cash flow. Timing differences associated with working capital accounted for an additional $661 million of cash inflow in the quarter. Our outstanding financial results were driven by strong operating performance. Compared with the prior year, first quarter production volumes increased 2% for oil and 7% overall. We mitigated most of the inflationary headwinds to limit the increase to per unit cash operating costs to just 3% or $10.59 per BOE, which was more than offset by a 12% decline in the DD&A rate. Capital expenditures in the quarter of $1.5 billion came in $100 million below target. Our longstanding free cash flow priorities and cash return framework remain consistent. Our priorities are sustainable regular dividend growth, a pristine balance sheet, additional cash return options and low cost property bolt-ons. We are committed to return a minimum of 60% of the annual free cash flow to shareholders through our sustainable regular dividend, special dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. We believe the consistent application of our free cash flow priorities and transparent cash return framework positions the company to create long-term shareholder value through the cycle. In March, we strengthened the balance sheet by paying off a $1.25 billion bond at maturity with cash on hand leaving $3.8 billion of debt on the balance sheet. The next maturity is a $500 million bond due April 2025. Cash at the end of the quarter was $5 billion, yielding a net cash position of $1.2 billion, up $300 million from December 31. Yesterday, our Board declared a second regular dividend of $0.825 per share, the same as last quarter and a 10% increase from the prior year level. The $3.30 annual rate is a $1.9 billion annual commitment. On March 30, we also paid the $1 per share special dividend declared in February. EOG also repurchased $310 million of stock in the first quarter at an average price of $105 per share. For several days during the last two weeks of March, market volatility created a significant dislocation between the price of our stock and the value of the business. We were able to utilize our strong balance sheet to repurchase shares at highly accretive prices. We will continue to monitor the price and value of our stock and you should expect us to step into the market again when there are significant dislocations. We are off to a very strong start in 2023 to deliver on our full year cash return commitment of a minimum of 60% of annual free cash flow. Altogether, the full year regular dividend along with the first quarter special dividend and buyback, represents $2.8 billion of cash return, which is about 50% of the $5.5 billion of free cash flow we forecast for 2023 assuming an $80 oil price. We will continue to monitor oil and gas prices going forward and we remain committed to delivering on our cash return commitment and look forward to updating you over the rest of the year. Here\u2019s Billy to discuss operations. Billy Helms : Thanks, Tim. EOG\u2019s operating performance continues to improve with the first quarter generating outstanding results. Our first quarter volume, capital expenditures and total per unit cash operating cost performance came in better than our forecasted targets. I\u2019d like to thank our employees for their dedication and outstanding execution, giving us a great start to 2023. Our full year 2023 capital and production plans are unchanged. We forecast a $6 billion capital program to deliver 3% oil volume growth and 9% total production growth. We maintained the pace of activity from the fourth quarter of last year in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford. Our core foundational plays and continue to expand development in our emerging Powder River Basin, Ohio Utica combo and South Texas Dorado plays. Well productivity and cost performance are meeting or beating expectations across our portfolio as each play sustains sufficient activity to support continued innovation. As Ezra mentioned, our foundational assets in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford are performing exceptionally well and were a big part of our overall strong first quarter results. Sustaining a consistent level of activity in these core plays is driving operational improvements and continues to be one of the primary hedges to offset areas of cost inflation. We are excited about the outlook for these assets in the years ahead. Even as these assets mature, we can apply technical learnings, operational innovation and leverage prior infrastructure investments to continue to improve the operating margin and capital efficiencies of these world-class assets. In the Delaware Basin, we expect well performance will continue to improve this year, delivering productivity and returns well above the premium hurdle rate. Last year, our Delaware Wolfcamp wells delivered an average six-month cumulative production of about 34 barrels of oil equivalent per foot and are expected to improve this year. See slide 10 of our updated investor presentation for details. While well mix can impact the relative contribution of oil, NGLs and natural gas, overall performance is improving in large part due to continued innovations like our new completion design. We have now tested 39 wells in the Wolfcamp that are yielding an average increase of 22% in the first year production, with a 20% uplift in the estimated ultimate recovery compared to the similar wells and targets using our previous completion design. With these encouraging results, we now expect to deploy this new design on about 70 wells this year. This new design is continuing to show promise, as we expand the number of wells and test the design across different targets and basins. Operationally, maintaining a consistent level of activity in the Delaware Basin, combined with our culture of continuous improvement is generating noticeable results. Drilling times continue to improve and are generating peer-leading performance aided by our drilling motor program and high-performing staff. The amount of footage drilled per motor run improved by 11% in the first quarter as compared to last year. Similar progress is being achieved with our completion operations with the expansion of our super zipper technique. These efforts, combined with the opportunities that co-developed multiple targets in the stacked pay resource by using our existing surface footprint and an infrastructure are expected to drive significant efficiency gains and continue to improve our margins in the Delaware Basin for years to come. The first -- we first introduced the super zipper completion technique in the Eagle Ford in 2020. Since then, we have expanded its use throughout the play and have more than doubled completions efficiency as measured by completed lateral feet per day. As indicated on page 12 of our quarterly investor slides, the amount of lateral completed per day year-to-date has increased by another 18% compared to last year. In the first quarter, we also set a record in the Eagle Ford, drilling our longest well to-date, reaching a measure depth of nearly 26,500 feet with a lateral length of over 15,500 feet. We expect to continue to see completion efficiency improvements as we extend laterals in the Eagle Ford to 3-plus miles where feasible. As a core operating area that has been under development for more than a decade, the Eagle Ford also benefits from our existing infrastructure from over 3,700 producing wells. Leveraging existing investments made in strategic water, oil and gas infrastructure minimizes future CapEx needs and lowers operating costs. Ongoing improvements to completion operations and leveraging the benefit of existing infrastructure, enable our Eagle Ford finding and development costs to continue to decline. Last year, the Eagle Ford\u2019s rate of return was the highest in the plays history. Longer term, we have over a decade of drilling inventory in the Eagle Ford, allowing us to maintain the current production base, while generating high returns and lowering breakevens. As previously mentioned, we are maintaining activity in our core plays and progressing our newer emerging plays. This year\u2019s plan in Dorado contemplates eight additional wells completed compared to 2022 in order to achieve a consistent level of activity to drive performance improvements. Our drilling operations are realizing a 29% improvement in the footage drilled per day since 2021. Completion operations will be conducted on a few wells in the second quarter. However, we are evaluating options to delay additional completions originally scheduled later this year due to the current natural gas price environment. To-date, operational progress towards improvements and Dorado\u2019s well performance is meeting or exceeding our early expectations. Activity in the Utica combo play is just commencing, yet we are already witnessing the compounding effects of sharing technology across our multiple plays. For example, drilling performance for recent wells is improving on the order of 20% to 30% compared to last year\u2019s results with the benefit of our proprietary drilling motor program and precision targeting. We expect similar levels of improvement from our completion program once we begin completing wells in the third quarter. Now for a little color on inflation and industry service costs. As we had anticipated in building this year\u2019s plan, the upward inflationary pressure that we witnessed last year appears to have plateaued, which still leaves us confident that our average well cost should increase no more than 10% compared to last year. Early indicators are showing signs of service cost moderation, which is more prevalent in some basins and less than others. We would expect that any softening of service and tubular costs will be slow to manifest into lower well cost and cash operating costs until much later in the year or more likely in 2024. As the year unfolds, we will continue to look for opportunities to leverage our scale and the flexibility of our multi-basin portfolio to manage costs across all operating areas. We also remain highly focused on sustainable cost reductions through innovation, operational performance and execution improvements to mitigate inflation and further drive down our cost structure. Now I will turn it back to Ezra. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Billy. In conclusion, I\u2019d like to note the following important takeaways. First, strong execution from every operating team across our multi-basin portfolio has positioned the company to deliver exceptional results in 2023. Thanks goes to our employees for delivering a great first quarter with their outstanding execution. Second, our foundational assets in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford are performing exceptionally well and were a significant part of our first quarter results. Third, our first quarter performance demonstrates the value of EOG\u2019s multi-basin portfolio. We have decades of low cost, high return inventory that spans oil combo and dry natural gas basins throughout the country. And fourth, our long-term outlook for both oil and gas remains positive, and our shift to premium drilling several years ago has helped decouple EOG\u2019s performance from short-term swings in the market. The result is an ability to deliver consistent, operational and financial performance that our shareholders have come to expect and that drives long-term value through the cycle. Thanks for listening. We will now go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul, your line is now open. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Two questions, please. I think the first one is probably for Billy. You talked about the Permian, the good well productivity. Just can you give us a little bit more detail in terms of the test size you have doing over there and whether you have increasing it, especially if you start to do more co-development and how many different landing zones or that you are targeting in your program? And second one that, just curious, I mean, I think, in the last, say, several months, a lot of investor have been asking why that go ahead with the expansion in the Dorado. And I think last quarter in the conference call, management has said, you have looking for the long-term. So just curious that what may have trigger your -- maybe there\u2019s a slightly change in your view about the pace on that development? Thank you. Billy Helms : Yeah. Paul, this is Billy. Let me give you a little highlight maybe of the Permian program and what we are seeing there. And then I will probably ask Jeff to give some more detailed color to help explain some of the improvements we are seeing. Overall, we are very pleased with the progress our Permian plans are showing. In general, our results are playing out just as we anticipated. In our plans, we had planned - all of our type curves are modeled and forecasted, and the results are meeting or exceeding our forecasted results including the co-development of different targets at the same time. But I\u2019d like to go ahead and turn it over now to Jeff to maybe talk a little bit about the new completion design and the results that we are seeing and then some of the productivity improvements. Jeff Leitzell : Yeah. Thanks, Billy. Paul, this is Jeff. Yeah. We\u2019re extremely happy with our productivity out of the Delaware. And just to give you a little color, one of the big things that\u2019s really improving that is our new completions design, or I should say, kind of our improved completion design. So, as Billy stated to date, we\u2019ve tested around 39 wells in the Wolfcamp and we are seeing an uplift of about 20% or so in the well productivity and that\u2019s in both the early and late life performance of that. I will also note that the uplift, we are not just seeing that in one phase. We\u2019re seeing both in oil and gas, so kind of across the Board. So with these outstanding results, what we have done is we have really expanded this program and we\u2019re planning on completing about 70 additional wells in the Wolfcamp this year. So going to be about a 2.5 times increase from last year and we definitely went ahead and taken this into account, both our drilling plans and guidance for 2023. So looking forward with this design, we\u2019ve had a lot of success in our deeper formations. Our team really plans to continue to kind of test in some of the shallower formations to evaluate its benefits. One thing that we have observed with this design is that there\u2019s varying performance uplift depending on the rock type and the depth of the target. And the design does come with a little bit of a cost increase, so we just want to be mindful about how quickly we\u2019re testing it and be strategic at the pace that we\u2019re going ahead and put these in the ground. Also, I\u2019d like to point out that the design isn\u2019t really new to EOG. It was actually first tested down in our Eagle Ford asset. And this is just an example of the technology transfer in the company of our multi-basin operations. It\u2019s really helped us accelerate our learnings throughout the company. And then lastly, with the success that we have seen in the Delaware Basin, we\u2019re actively testing it in all of our emerging places throughout the company and really look forward to evaluating those results throughout the year. Billy Helms : And then, Paul, the other part of your question was on Dorado and really what triggered the change of pace that we have thinking about. We put together a plan originally just to remind everybody that really, it was not a huge acceleration in activity planned for. We\u2019re only adding eight wells. So the plan never contemplated a huge amount of growth in the -- in Dorado to start with. However, we always remain flexible on our program and with -- that\u2019s the benefit of having a multi-basin portfolio as we can move activity around based on market conditions or other factors as they present themselves. Naturally, with gas prices remaining weak and moving into the year, it\u2019s only natural to think about options that we might be able to explore with Dorado activity. We are exploring the option to delay some completions that were scheduled for later in the year and we will give more color on that as that unfolds. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Cheng. The next question is from the line of Leo Mariani with ROTH Capital Partners. Leo, your line is now open. Leo Mariani : Yeah. Hi. Just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the buyback versus the special dividend. Obviously, there was no new special dividend, I guess, announced this quarter instead, you got certainly lean on the buyback as you described in March. I just wanted to kind of confirm your thinking around this. I mean it still sounds like the buyback is going to be reserved only for kind of very opportunistic situations, where there is this dislocation. And generally speaking, it\u2019s probably more reasonable to expect the special going forward with the buyback kind of maybe every once in a while, is that kind of how to think about it? Ezra Yacob : Yes. Leo, this is Ezra Yacob. Good morning. I think that\u2019s -- I think you have summarized it pretty well. Our strategy hasn\u2019t really changed. We are committed to returning at least 60% of our free cash flow on an annual basis. Year-to-date, as Tim had mentioned, our cash return commitment is $2.8 billion. It\u2019s approximately 50% of our -- what would be our fiscal year free cash flow at the assumed $80 oil price there. And just to recall, the cash return priorities for us, it really begins with the regular dividend as the first priority. The excess free cash flow, as you said, will either come back in the form of special dividends, which we have paid seven quarters of the last eight quarters, we have distributed a special dividend or opportunistic buybacks. And what we saw in the first quarter when we executed a repurchase was, we really saw a dislocation dominantly associated with the banking crisis and we were able to step in to repurchase approximately $300 million of the stock. So, as you pointed out, really in line with our strategy. Now what I would say has changed over the last 18 months since putting the repurchase authorization in place is really the strength of our company. Our primary value proposition, of course, is investing in high return projects, adding lower cost reserves to our company\u2019s profile, which thereby reduces our breakevens and expands our margins. And so as we continue to execute on this strategy and we continue to strengthen the company, the way we consider dislocations certainly evolves as well. Leo Mariani : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And I just wanted to see if there\u2019s any more of a robust update on the Utica. I think the last time you guys kind of rolled that out. I think you had four wells on production with a fair bit of history. Just trying to get a sense of the more wells producing at this point in time in the Utica and just any thoughts around some of the long-term performance of those prior wells have been on for, I guess, over a year at this point? Ken Boedeker : Yeah. Leo, this is Ken. We\u2019re making excellent progress on our Utica program this year. We currently have a drilling rig actively operating in our northern area and we\u2019re progressing nicely on our gathering and infrastructure projects. The four wells that you talked about that we drilled and completed in 2022 really do continue to deliver our expected performance and we plan to drill and complete about 15 wells across both our North and Southern areas this year and we will have those production results more towards the end of the year. Another thing to note is we also continue to add acreage and look for additional low-cost opportunities to add to our position. Operator : Thank you, Leo. The next question is from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC. Scott, please go ahead. Scott Hanold : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning and congrats on the quarter. Ezra, maybe if I could pivot back on the buyback conversation and if you can give us some color on, what were the key triggers on the decision to do buybacks? Was it relative valuation of EOG to peers, was it just the aggregate move or is there other things like intrinsic value assessments that kind of generated that process to really kick it off there? Ezra Yacob : Good morning, Scott. Yes. This is Ezra. Those are all accurate to the tune of how we kind of look at these opportunities. As we have talked about in the past, it kind of begins with the macro, first of all, right? What\u2019s happening on both global and domestic supply and demand balances. As far as dislocations go, we do measure, we look at the intrinsic value of our business relative to different pricing scenarios, both short- and long-term. And we do evaluate trading multiples, not just at EOG versus the peers, but actually for the entire peer group and see what\u2019s happening. And so one comparison that could be made is the dramatic sell-off that the industry saw last summer, which was associated with a pretty dramatic pullback in oil prices, that was really fundamentally supported by a change we felt in the macro outlook. There was a significant announcement there for roughly 300 million barrels of petroleum reserves that would be hitting the market on the supply side from across the globe. What we saw in the first quarter was not really supported by a big change in the forecast on the fundamentals. Potentially really just triggered from the banking crisis, potentially an increased fear on the demand side from increased recession, but we really feel like most of that has already been priced in to the market on the demand side. And so when we saw a pullback there in a dislocation with the market, really again associated in late March there with the banking crisis. We really didn\u2019t hesitate and we have able to step into the market and do that $300 million share repurchase and we think we have really created a significant amount of value there for the shareholders. Scott Hanold : That\u2019s great. Thanks for that. And as my follow-up, one of the things I think tends to get lost or is underappreciated is the premium pricing you all continue to get on your commodities across the Board. And can you just give us a sense of -- as you kind of look forward, do you find more opportunities ahead where you can continue to raise the bar on that as well? Lance Terveen : Hey, Scott. Good morning. This is Lance. Thanks for the question. Yeah. The -- our realizations continue to be excellent, and I mean, when we think about it, it\u2019s really just the capability that we have. When you think about the multi-basins that we have, but just our transport position and then the capacity that we have taken out. You hear us talk a lot about control and having control all the way to the water is exceptionally important. So I would just say, as you think about our position and the price realizations too and then extracting additional premiums, I think, our ability to just transact very quickly and with the supply, the scale that we have, I mean, we can definitely walk in with further opportunities. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Scott, please go ahead. Scott Gruber : Yes. Good morning. I want to circle back on the Wolfcamp development strategy. After looking at slide 10 here in the deck, last year you layered in more Wolfcamp M wells. But this year, the percentage of Wolfcamp M will be slowing back down some. Is that impacted by where you will develop and deploy the new completion design or is that a reflection tend to be more selective with where you co-develop the Wolfcamp M, just what guidance shift in mix? Jeff Leitzell : Yeah. Scott, this is Jeff. Really with the -- our co-development strategy, it\u2019s pretty straightforward, and what we have trying to do is, we have just adding in high rate of return targets to our well packages. And really it\u2019s driven by the geology, and obviously, the geology across our acreage, it changes very quickly. So kind of from development unit to development unit, we have really got to strategically dissect what our strategy is going to be there. But from what we have seeing right now, and you can see that on slide 10 and 11 in our deck, by adding in some of those deeper targets in the lower Wolfcamp, or I should say, the lower Upper Wolfcamp and then the middle, we have achieving economics well over our premium hurdle rates and we have some of the tightest co-develop pacing out there in the basin. So ultimately, just this approach, I mean, it\u2019s improving our total recovery per acre, helping optimize that NPV of the resource and it\u2019s just adding those barrels finding costs below our current Delaware Basin levels. Scott Gruber : Got it. And then maybe just one for some more color on the new completion design. You said it was initially developed and rolled out the Eagle Ford. Did it become a dominant design in the Eagle Ford and will it become the dominant design in the Permian and how quickly it can be rolled out to some of your new plays? Ezra Yacob : Yeah. Scott, great question. So, yeah, the design, as I talked about, it was first utilized in the Eagle Ford. It was back in -- right around 2016 and we didn\u2019t see the same uplift that we see in the Permian. It wasn\u2019t quite as extensive, but it really has to do with the difference in rock type and their geological properties between the two plays. But it did provide the application, we are really beneficial as far as helping lower well costs and reduce our completion time. So, yes, it is something that we still do employ there in the Eagle Ford, and as I said, in a lot of our emerging plays. As far as in the Delaware and our rollout, our plan is to increase, as I said, the year-over-year number by 2.5 times what we did last year. And I also did state, there\u2019s just a slight cost increase, so we want to be cognizant of how quickly we roll it out and like anything in our program, we just don\u2019t want to outrun our learnings and we want to make sure that we continue to evolve this technique as we learn. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. Derrick, please go ahead. Derrick Whitfield : Good morning, all, and thanks for taking my questions. With my first question, I wanted to focus on CapEx cadence throughout 2023. With Q1 coming in better than expected in Q2 projected to be heavier than expected. Could you comment on the one to two drivers, and separately, if not part of the answer, could you speak to cadence on non-D&C investments throughout 2023? Billy Helms : Yeah. Derek, this is Billy Helms. So, yeah, the second quarter CapEx has gotten to be a little bit higher than the first quarter and it\u2019s mainly due to some non-drilling and completion capital, the indirect or infrastructure and those kind of things that we put in our program that it was recently scheduled to occur at the latter half of the first quarter, it turned out to be pushed into the second quarter. That\u2019s the reason the first quarter under -- was under our own CapEx and the second quarter is a little bit higher. And that really sticks to our original plan, we had always planned for about 52% of our CapEx to be spent in the first half of the year and so we have still on target for that in the 48% in the back half, so that\u2019s kind of the way the program plays out. Derrick Whitfield : Great. And with my follow-up, I\u2019d like to focus on your operational efficiency gains in the Eagle Ford. Is your gain principally driven by increased super zipper activity, and if so, are there practical limitations on the amount of completions you could pursue utilizing this approach? Ken Boedeker : Yeah. Derek, this is Ken. I\u2019d like to start off by really crediting our team there in San Antonio for driving down that finding cost that you talked about. Really by focusing on improving the efficiency of every portion of the process, we have been able to drive down costs over the past several years. And increasing our lateral lengths, while improving targeting and focusing on bit and motor performance in conjunction with the advent of super zipper completion operations have really allowed us to improve efficiencies and really drill and complete more lateral footage in a day compared to a few years ago. That\u2019s really showing up on a lower cost basis. And one thing to note is we do have over 10 years of high-return drilling in this play that can sustain our current production levels and continue to expand our margins. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug? John Abbott : Good morning. This is John Abbott on for Doug Leggate. Our questions -- first our question are really on Dorado. We understand that you have going to potentially delay activity this year. But one of the goals that you set out this year was to try to just begin get greater economies of scale into play. When do you think you need to achieve that size and scale, noting that you have additional LNG capacity coming on, exposure in 2026? Billy Helms : Yeah. John, this is Billy Helms. So for Dorado, yes, we are increasing activity there, mainly from a drilling side. Recently we had planned to also bring in additional completions. On the drilling side, I would add that, we are seeing a tremendous improvement in the efficiency gains there. The team there has done just an excellent job of being able to improve our drilling times, lower our well costs and just increase efficiencies overall. So we have very pleased with the progress we have made and so I think that increased activity we have seeing on the drilling side is playing out what we have seeing on the drilling results and giving us insights into how we can continue to lower well costs going forward. On the completion side, we have some planned activity here in the second quarter. But beyond that, we have looking at ways we can -- with the flexibility we have in our program to delay the completion of any wells that would be on in the second half. And really just thinking about how we can leverage some of the learnings from our other programs in play and combine that activity with the activity we have in Dorado by sharing equipment, people and those learnings across our portfolio. So we don\u2019t really feel the need to jump in and complete those wells, but we are evaluating options as they roll out and we will see how those present themselves. And then as far as the activities for\u2026 John Abbott : I guess\u2026 Billy Helms : \u2026LNG demand, I guess, the play -- the unique thing about this play, it didn\u2019t take a lot of wells. The wells are very prolific. So we have well ahead of any timing that we would need to add LNG capacity in the future. And then we also have the flexibility of moving gas from other operating areas, multi-basin portfolio to the Gulf Coast. So don\u2019t think of the Dorado is just simply applying itself to the LNG market. It\u2019s got the opportunity but looking at gas from other players to the Gulf Coast as well through our marketing arrangements. John Abbott : That\u2019s extremely helpful, which leads to the next question. Assuming there was not an issue with gas prices, how do you think about the optimal level of production for that play or activity long-term? I mean, how big does it came to get to? How do you think about that program -- that -- from an efficiency program longer term? Ken Boedeker : Yeah. John, this is Ken. John Abbott : You can\u2026 Ken Boedeker : Yeah. John, this is Ken. I think the real thing in Dorado is it doesn\u2019t take a lot of wells to generate significant volumes out of that play. So I don\u2019t know the exact right pace. But what we want to do is we want to develop this at the right pace where we don\u2019t outrun our learnings. We have making significant progress as we really get those operational synergies together that Billy talked about and so that pace of development is really going to be dictated by not outrunning our learnings. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist. Neal, please go ahead. Neal Dingmann : Good morning. Thanks for the time. My first question, just on the Powder River. I am just wondering I heard too much on that right. I am just wondering how do you still feel this competes versus your other premium players? I know at one time, you suggested you had almost 1,700 locations and I am just wondering your thoughts around this. Jeff Leitzell : Yeah. Neal, this is Jeff. No. We have outstanding results there in the Powder right now and it\u2019s some of the lowest finding costs that we have seeing there in the whole portfolio. So, yeah, we still have between kind of our full South Powder River Basin and then moving up to our North, about 1,600 net undrilled premium locations. So just looking at our program, everything is on pace this year. The wells are performing as we expected. Q1 we have completed about 15 gross wells, which two-thirds of those were Mowry and we have seeing a lot of benefits also by getting some consistent activity up there in the Powder. We have running a consistent two and -- two to three rigs and one full frac spread with that, which is really allowing them to kind of push their efficiencies. And then we also have a lot of confidence in the play just with the overall performance and stuff with the Mowry. And then from there, as we talked about, we want to go ahead and gather the data in the upper overlying formations like the Niobrara, so we can develop that later in the future. Also, additional confidence in the play, I think, would be really -- should be said is that the infrastructure acquisition that we had. We had noted that in our 10-Q, we acquired Evolution. And I will go ahead and let maybe Lance say a couple of things on that. Lance Terveen : Yeah. No. Thanks, Jeff. Yeah. Just to add to that, on our confidence when we think about the Powder River Basin, we did make a strategic investment there. That was about $135 million and we view that as a bolt-on acquisition and that\u2019s really midstream footprint. There\u2019s a plant and gathering system that just overlays our southern acreage. The plant is a first-class asset. It was completed in 2019 and when we think about this, it just really complements our existing gas gathering infrastructure build-out as we have connections in place. So we really look at that as value, because we can load that plant, fill the plant very quickly. And there\u2019s also other benefits that we see long-term as well, as we think about just lowering cash operating costs, gathering, processing expense versus third parties, we will have control and redundancy, but then also to the confidence we can expand that very quickly. So\u2026 Neal Dingmann : Was that\u2026 Lance Terveen : \u2026 the last thing I just... Neal Dingmann : Was that plant helped a deeps there as well? I am just wondering would you mention with that plant, would that boost the deeps there a little bit as well? Lance Terveen : When we think about that, we think about actually the gathering, processing and transportation expense. So it\u2019s absolutely when we think about loading it with our equity gas into that facility and having been control, we have definitely going to see better netbacks. But it\u2019s more as we think about just controlling the cost and lowering the cost basis of the company that\u2019s going to absolutely make the Powder River Basin and the Southern acres they are more competitive. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein. Bob? Bob Brackett : Good morning. Back to the Wolfcamp co-development. If you have hitting 2-plus targets in the Wolfcamp versus, say, cherry picking the best zone, all things being equal, you would expect wells to get worse, yet you have seeing wells get better. Is that attributable completely to the design change? Ezra Yacob : No. I\u2019d say it\u2019s attributed to our co-development strategy. I mean it\u2019s -- really, it\u2019s been a process over time. So if you look at back in 2016 in the Wolfcamp or I should say our strategy through the whole Permian, we had six unique targets and kind of fast forward here, we have up to 18 unique targets. Obviously, with that, the spacing has changed both in zone and from a vertical perspective. So our teams have methodically obviously tested this. They have taken into account the actual spacing, how they interact, the depletion to it, and we have come up obviously with the best co-development strategy really to maximize the overall production of those intervals and then obviously maximize the economics related to it. Bob Brackett : Great. I guess the follow-up would be, so it sounds like the co-development strategy is driven by that desire to maximize the lack of communication between zones or is it more driven by just logistics of having that kit sit in one spot for a longer time? Ezra Yacob : No. It\u2019s really -- it\u2019s about maximizing the overall resource there, as you said. So we do have the optimal amount of communication that we have actually able to optimize the recovery and then like I said, really maximize those economics. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Arun, please go ahead. Arun Jayaram : Yeah. Good morning. I wanted to come back to the new completion design. You highlighted how you have tested this on 39 wells and you plan to go to 70 wells. And my question is, was the 20% uplift relative to wells in the same area or relative to the -- to your type curve? And maybe the follow-up is, are the 70 wells contemplated for this calendar year and was that part of your guidance, did that include that or would that reflect an upside risk to your oil guide? Billy Helms : Yeah. Arun, this is Billy. So the uplift we have seeing, part of that was actually baked into our guidance. We didn\u2019t bake in the entire amount. So when we put together our plan, we understood that there were going to be some uplift. We did plan on 70 wells to be part of that calendar year program and we have baked in some of that into our production guidance, knowing that we would see some uplift. I think the uplift is surprising us a little bit more to the upside, but I would say that\u2019s already factored into our guidance that we have issued. And then as far as the what we have doing there, we were finding that the target is critical. So the rock type is critical to why it works in some areas and so we have cautiously moving through our program to make sure we test as we go to understand which our targets lend themselves best to this design change and which ones don\u2019t, because it does cost a little bit more and we want to be very disciplined on how we apply that across the fields we maximize as Jeff was saying, the economics of the play. Arun Jayaram : Okay. And just my follow-up is, any update on Beehive and Australia timing? Billy Helms : Yeah. Arun, on Beehive, we have still excited to be able to drill that well, but it\u2019s going to be probably in the first half of next year before we have able to get that well drilled. And\u2026 Operator : Thank you. Billy Helms : \u2026just really due to some timing on permits and those kind of things. Operator : The next question is from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles, please go ahead. Charles Meade : Good morning, Ezra, Billy, Ken and the whole EOG team there. I think just a couple of quick ones for me touching on some of the common themes that you have already spoken on for a while. The Dorado, evaluating the slowdown, can you give some insight in your thinking? Is this about the natural gas price falling below your 250 [ph] double premium or is this about the contango you see in the curve and just the value of just waiting a few months or is it -- I recognize those aren\u2019t exclusive, but just some insight what really keep you guys to want to examine that? Billy Helms : Yeah. Charles, this is Billy. Certainly, it really is not triggered on a specific gas price, but just the overall softness we see in the current market conditions and the need to simply bring more gas on in this current condition. As we talk near-term, we understand the near-term softness in the market but longer term, medium and longer term, we have still very bullish on the long-term outlook for gas. So we do look at the different flex -- the flexibility we have in the program and we have evaluating options to be able to successfully push those back in the year. And we have just continue to remain disciplined on our investment to make sure we have maximizing the value to the company over the long-term. Charles Meade : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one more quick one on this Wolfcamp completion design. So I got the message, I think, in your last -- your response to the last question, that this is not going to be an across the Board shift that you would want to make. But presumably you have confirmed, I think, you have talking about 16 targets it works and can you give us a sense as we work in a quarter of the targets and maybe upside to half or three quarters or what\u2019s it look like to you guys right now? Jeff Leitzell : Yeah. This is Jeff again. Yeah. That is correct. It\u2019s not necessarily a one size fits all across. It really does have to do with the geology that we have applying it to. And when looking particularly there in the Permian, we primarily just applied it down in the deeper Wolfcamp targets. So that would basically be just kind of the up or down through the middle in a co-development standpoint. Now we are testing on those shallower targets, but there are quite a few different rock types. So right now, I\u2019d say it\u2019s area by area, and from a percentage basis, you kind of hate to put an actual percentage on it. But right now we have still evaluating that, and it will be a case-by-case basis. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil? Neil Mehta : Yeah. Good morning, team. My question was on the natural gas liquids market where realizations, obviously, have been trending lower. I am just curious on your perspective on what gets NGLs to firm up relative to WTI and what are you seeing real time in the export markets? Thank you. Lance Terveen : Yeah. Neil, good morning. It\u2019s Lance. Yeah. I think what you have continuing to see absolutely the export positions that are getting built out. I think as you kind of have to think of those kind of as we think about them kind of more on ethane and more in propane. So continuing to see healthy propane exports. We continue to see the build out. That\u2019s a company with that. You have continuing to see the demand as you think about the Far East demand that\u2019s going to be the demand pool for those barrels. So continue to see that there could be some firming up there, kind of maybe more longer term, ethane, obviously, is going to flow a little bit more with gas prices and that\u2019s kind of like what you have seeing today. Neil Mehta : Great. And then just curious on your guys\u2019 perspective on the gas markets as well. You have talked a little bit about slowing down potentially in terms from a drilling perspective, but how do you see the balances moving from here in a weather normal way over the course of the year? Ezra Yacob : Yes. Neil, this is Ezra. As I stated kind of in the opening remarks, we still remain constructive on kind of the longer term gas story for the U.S. We think that the U.S., especially Dorado being a big piece of it has really captured low cost of gas supply that can really compete on the global scale with the amount of LNG that the U.S. is exporting right now, which is at record levels right now for the U.S. combined with the number of projects that have made it through a financial or a final investment decision and then the additional projects that are still being kind of planned and discussed, the U.S. will be long-term position to be really a global leader in the LNG market. Now gas is always difficult because it is highly volatile when it comes to things like the short-term pricing on weather. And it\u2019s one reason you have heard this morning from both myself, Ken and Billy that the most important thing we look at when we develop Dorado is to really invest in that at the right pace for the long term. We want to make sure that we have not out running our learnings, that we appropriately invest to be able to keep our costs low and at the end of the day, really keep our margins wide. We want to put in the correct infrastructure to keep our low operating costs, because the margins are always pretty skinny on gas and the low-cost producer for gas is going to be able to be exposed to the global market here in the U.S. for the long-term. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Josh Silverstein with UBS. Josh, please go ahead. Josh Silverstein : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe just sticking with gas first. You have an unusually wide gap on your differential even after reporting the first quarter results. Can you just talk about how you think that may shape over the course of the year, what you have looking for to come in towards the high end versus the low end there? Thanks. Lance Terveen : Yeah, Josh. Hey. This is Lance. I believe when we think about our guidance, I think, we were just below the midpoint of the guidance on our realization so from a gas standpoint. And then you have seen kind of our guidance for like the full year and we expect a lot of that\u2019s going to be driven, obviously, we have the diversification that we have with our California exposure. We have -- you can see on our supplemental slide, slide eight, you can obviously see the large exposure that we have into the Gulf Coast and then obviously, our JKM exposure as well. So I think we have going to hold with the existing guidance that we have. Josh Silverstein : Got it. And then just as far as the shareholder return profile, I know you have been thinking about it from a percentage of free cash flow. But how would you think about it from managing like a cash balance standpoint? You have been over $5 billion now for the past few quarters, including paying down the debt maturity in the first quarter. Is $5 billion, $6 billion the right level of cash for EOG? What level of cash would you not want to get over, because it feels like there are certain periods where you could return over 100% of cash or free cash flow to shareholders if you really want to? Thanks. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Josh. This is Ezra. When we came out with that cash return guidance with a minimum of 60%, we really did just mean that, but it\u2019s a minimum. In fact, last year we returned excess of this 60% free cash flow to our shareholders. And we started with that 60%, because we feel confident on that, especially when we roll in kind of almost a peer-leading regular dividend that we would be able to compete and deliver that through the cycles. So when we think about a specific target for cash on hand, I wouldn\u2019t say that we have a real target. We have spoken about some indicators and things that we strategically think about as far as holding a cash balance. The first, of course, is we like to have a bit of cash on balance just to run the business to make us allow us to stay out of commercial paper, and historically, that\u2019s around about $2 billion kind of depending at what point you are in the cycle. And then in addition to that, we do like to have cash on hand so that we can be strategic and counter cyclically invest in opportunities as they arise, whether that\u2019s at times investing in casing or line pipe or last year we were able to step in and do an acquisition in one of our emerging players there in the Utica, where we actually purchased approximately 130,000 mineral rights. And then lastly, of course, just the stock repurchase, which we exercised here in the first quarter. We have talked about being able to utilize that opportunistically and really part of our strategy, the reason that you can actually step into a dislocated market and have the confidence to do a buyback is that you have got the strength of the balance sheet, which includes cash on hand. That\u2019s really what we have going for and so I think that provides another compelling reason to carry potentially a higher cash balance than the company has historically done. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session for today. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Yacob for any closing or additional remarks. Ezra Yacob : I just want to thank everyone for participating on the call this morning and I especially want to thank our employees for the outstanding results they delivered in this first quarter. Thank you. Operator : That concludes the EOG Resources first quarter 2023 earnings results conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir. Tim Driggers : Thank you. Good morning and thanks for joining us. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG\u2019s SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures can be found on EOG\u2019s website. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC\u2019s reserve reporting guidelines. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Jeff Leitzell, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor Relations and Finance. Here is Ezra. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results reflect exceptional execution throughout our multi-basin portfolio. Production volumes, CapEx, cash operating costs and DD&A all beat targets driving another quarter of excellent financial performance. We earn $1.5 billion of adjusted net income and generated $1 billion of free cash flow, year-to-date we've generated free cash flow of $2.1 billion. That free cash flow and cash on the balance sheet funded year-to-date cash returned to shareholders of $2.2 billion, including more than $600 million of share repurchases executed during the first half of the year. Taking into account our full year regular dividend, we have committed to return $3.1 billion to shareholders in 2023, or about 67% of our estimated 2023 cash flow assuming a $75 oil price well ahead of our target minimum return of 60%. EOGs peer-leading regular dividend is currently the majority of the $3.1 billion of cash return and committed to shareholders this year. Our sustainable growing regular dividend which we have never cut nor suspended remains the first priority to return cash.  We also continue to leverage special dividends and buybacks to return additional cash depending on market conditions through the first two quarters of 2023 we've deployed more than $600 million to opportunistically repurchase shares during times of increased volatility. And while our cash return strategy remains consistent, what has evolved since putting the $5 billion repurchase authorization in place over a year and a half ago, is the fundamental strength of our business. And we continue to get better through relentless execution of and commitment to EOGs value proposition.  We invest in high return projects across our multi-basin portfolio, adding lower costs reserves, which reduces our breakeven and expands our margins. We are now actively investing in five premium basins, more than any time in our history. Our foundational assets in the Delaware Basin an Eagle Ford continue to consistently deliver and we're pleased by the outstanding progress across our emerging Southern Powder River Basin, Ohio Utica Combo, and South Texas Dorado plays.  Well productivity and cost performance are meeting or beating expectations across our portfolio as we invest and develop each asset at a pace that supports consistent execution and continued innovation. We continue to lower the cost basis of our company, utilizing technology and innovation that improves well performance and lowers well costs to sustainably reduce our finding and development costs, efficiencies and infrastructure investments are lowering current and future unit operating costs and contribute to our emissions reduction efforts.  Finally, we have further strengthened our pristine balance sheet this year, while generating significant free cash flow and funding our transparent cash return strategy, which is designed to deliver consistent shareholder value through the cycle. And heading into the second half of 2023. Our continued performance gains will be complemented by strong fundamentals. Oil demand has been resilient despite volatility in the first half of the year, and demand is showing signs of continued growth through the second half of the year. Strong inventory drawers since the start of the year have pulled oil inventories below five year averages and refinery utilization remains high. Production growth in the U.S. is on pace to deliver similar rates as 2022, while exiting the year with significantly less activity as public companies continue to demonstrate discipline. And it appears OPEC+ are following through on an ounce production cuts. The culmination of these actions should further reduce inventory levels and place upward pressure on pricing through year end. Regarding North American natural gas, while inventory levels remain above the five-year average, prices have firmed up recently, reflecting a reduction in natural gas drilling, and an increase in demand from both power generation and LNG exports. These trends should support a more balanced supply and demand environment late this year and heading into 2024. We remain constructive on the longer term gas story for the U.S. supported by recent LNG project approvals, and the growing petrochemical complex on the Gulf Coast.  And we're especially pleased with Dorados place in the market, as one of the lowest cost supplies of natural gas in the U.S. with an advantage location and emissions profile. EOGs value proposition is delivering results and the strength of our business has never been better to deliver value for the shareholders through industry cycles and play a leading role in the long term future of energy.  Now here's Tim to review our financial position. Tim Driggers : Thanks, Ezra. EOG delivered excellent operating and financial performance in all areas in the second quarter. Oil production increased 3% year-over-year while total production increased 5%. Per unit cash operating costs remained essentially flat from the prior year period despite industry wide inflation. Compared to the first quarter, however, per unit cash operating costs declined by 5% and were lower in all four categories. We're beginning to see the benefits of lower cost improve our operating margin.  The DD&A rate fell by 10% year-over-year driven by the addition of reserves at lower finding costs compared to our production base. Capital expenditures came in at $1.5 billion $130 million below our target and just slightly above the first quarter level. The difference was mostly due to the timing of non-well related costs such as infrastructure projects. Year-to-date CapEx of $3 billion is 50% of the full year budget.  The improving capital efficiency of our assets, consistent operational execution, along with the application of innovation and technology to lower costs is making a big impact on the financial performance of the company. We earned adjusted net income of $2.49 per share in the second quarter, and generated free cash flow of $1 billion. Return on capital employed for the last 12 months is 29% at an average WTI oil price of $81 and Henry Hub natural gas price of about $5.  Here's Billy to review operations. Billy Helms : Thanks, Tim. I would like to first thank our employees for their commitment and dedication that led to another quarter of exceptional execution. EOG once again meet our forecasted targets and delivered a near perfect quarter. As a result, we have completed the first half of the year ahead on volumes, and ahead on total per unit cash operating cost. Our volume performance in the first half of the year is due to several factors. The performance of new wells is outpacing our forecast, primarily in the Delaware Basin, part of which is due to our new completion design. We're also experiencing less downtime due to market interruptions than previously planned, our investments in infrastructure along with real time data analytics provided the control and flexibility needed to redirect sales volumes to different markets to maintain production. Unit cash operating costs through the first half of the year average 5% below the midpoint of our quarterly guidance, due to a combination of several factors including lower lease operating expenses, as well as reduced transportation cost. Lower workover and compression related expense reduced LOE, while transportation costs benefited from the flexibility to sell into more favorable markets throughout the quarter. Credit goes to the cross functional efforts of our production, marketing and information systems teams, who remain focused on sustainable, low cost operations quarter after quarter. We have line of sight to maintain these cost improvements throughout the year, and as a result have reduced our full year guidance for total unit cash operating cost.  Operationally, EOG is firing on all cylinders. Our foundational Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin plays are delivering exceptional results. While our emerging plays benefit from learnings and technology transfer across our multi-basin portfolio. Our decentralized structure supports innovation in each operating area, which much and much like independent technology incubators, and compounds the impact of that innovation by taking ideas born in one area and expanding them across multiple basins and across multiple functions. Across every operating area, our frontline engineers and geologists work that technology every day to lower cost and improve well performance. We look for strategic opportunities to vertically integrate certain services within the supply chain, where we find an opportunity to better align those services with our goals. That includes areas like downhole drilling motors, drilling mud, sand and water. Developing such capabilities in-house significantly improves the cost structure of the company.  This quarter we're highlighting drilling performance improvements in the south Texas Dorado, South Powder River Basin Mowry and the Ohio Utica Combo plays. Our emerging plays are moving up the learning curve faster due to the benefit of drilling advancements, and the application of technology over the past decade.  We continue to evolve our proprietary suite of applications, powered by real time high frequency data and analytics to assist our frontline employees to collaborate and make decisions faster. The combined benefit of these efforts has already contributed to an increase of up to 25% in drilling feet per day for wells and our emerging plays this year. In our Ohio Utica play, we recently drilled a 15,700-foot lateral in 2.6 days and 100% in zone.  Capitalization expenditures for the first half are also a running light, due primarily to the infrastructure span that has been deferred into the second half of the year. It is worth noting the economic impact of our investments in EOG owned infrastructure. Our realized U.S. oil price in the second quarter was $1.23 above WTI. And U.S. natural gas was essentially flat to Henry Hub.  CapEx for our drilling and completion program are right on track. The rate of change for inflation this year is consistent with what we'd anticipated started the year. So we still see line of sight to limit year-over-year well cost inflation in \u201823 to just 10% While any additional softening of service cost in this year has the potential to impact 2024. It's simply too early to predict. The market remains too dynamic, particularly given the constructive outlook for oil in the second half of the year.  Furthermore, we remain focused on generating long-term, sustainable cost reductions, driven by utilizing the highest quality equipment and the highest performing teams, which are less exposed to the leading edge price declines that we see in more marginal equipment. Our $6 billion capital program is focused -- is forecasted to deliver 3% or volume growth and 6% total liquid growth. In Dorado, our South Texas Natural Gas play, we delayed the timing of plant completions earlier this year, and about five wells had been pushed into early 2024. Thus, we reduced our full year gas volume guidance accordingly.  We maintained our drilling pace in Dorado to build operational momentum and capture the corresponding efficiencies. As a result, we're seeing a 16% improvement in our drilling times for Dorado. As shown on slide 11 of our updated Investor Presentation. We\u2019re constructive on natural gas longer term, and believe Dorado will be one of the lowest cost and lowest emission supplies of natural gas in the U.S. and will compete on a global scale.  This year started out with many challenges, but also many opportunities to continue to improve the company. I am very pleased with the progress our teams continue to deliver and remain optimistic about the second half of the year, and how the company has positioned for the future.  Now I'll turn the call over to Ken to discuss progress on lowering our emissions. Ken Boedeker : Thanks, Billy. We're continuing to make outstanding progress on our emissions goals. As a preview to our 2022 sustainability report that will be published in September, we are excited to announce that we've reached three significant near term goals well ahead of schedule. First, our 2022 GHG intensity rate of 13.3 metric tons of CO2e per Mboe as less than our 2025 goal of 13.5.  Second, our 2022 methane emissions percentage is 0.04% of our natural gas produced and is significantly less than our 2025 goal of 0.06%. And third, we have achieved our zero routine flaring goal in 2023, well ahead of our 2025 target, and significantly ahead of the World Bank initiative, which strives to attain zero routine flaring by 2030. We have also confirmed that our wellhead gas capture rate for 2022 was 99.9% of the gas produced.  We continue to expand our in-house continuous methane monitoring technology named iSense and finished 2022 with 95% of our production in the Delaware Basin covered by iSense monitoring. As a reminder, the power of iSense is incorporating continuous methane monitoring data with our production and facilities data and monitoring this data on a 24-hour basis in one of our four control centers.  This enhances our ability to identify potential leaks, and prioritize repairs that are needed in the field to minimize fugitive emissions. As with a number of EOG operations, it is anticipated that collection and integration of iSense data will lead to continuous improvement in facilities and production design and operations. We're excited about the progress we've made in the last several years on our emissions performance and are very proud that we have such dedicated employees who are continuing making our operations more efficient. Their innovative solutions and push to beat expectations have driven us to exceed our goals early. We are currently assessing new goals with our operations groups and anticipate publicizing those goals in the first half of 2024.  Now, here's Ezra, to wrap up. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Ken. Our second quarter results demonstrate once again that EOGs value proposition works. We invest in high return low cost assets across a diverse multi basin portfolio. We leverage technology and innovation to sustainably lower well costs and reduce emissions. These high return low cost investments generate significant free cash flow to fund our transparent cash return strategy backstopped by a pristine balance sheet to deliver consistent shareholder value through the cycle. Most importantly, our culture is at the core of our value proposition and is our ultimate competitive advantage. Thanks for listening we'll now go to Q& A Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Paul, please go ahead. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning. Can you hear me okay? Ezra Yacob : Yes, sir. Paul, go ahead, please. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Two questions, please. First, on the cash return on the free cash flow, thank you that you are paying more than 100%. Just want to see how you determine that this is the right time to pay more than 100%, or how should we reset into the future given you're already in a net cash position, should we think that there's a little bit change in the management view and the payout is going to perhaps closer to 100% until that maybe that market condition change. And also that whether we should read the second consecutive quarter of the buyback means that management now see the buyback as more of an ongoing part of the toolbox on your cash return? That's the first question.  Second question that on Dorado, the decision that to delay the five well in this year. Can you -- maybe share with us, I think Billy has mentioned that, can you share with us then what's the thinking behind the delay? I know that the Street has been bugging you that you should delay the Dorado, and you guys do it in this quarter. But I want to understand a little bit better in terms of the decision-making process behind. And the full year guidance reduction, I think it's all related to that, right? Thank you. Ezra Yacob : Sure, Paul. This is Ezra. I think I'll take that first question and then Billy can address the second question regarding Dorado. So yes, on the first one, it's kind of a broad question on our cash return strategy. So hopefully, I hit on all the points that you're trying to get at. But first, let's start with our guidance, which has always been the minimum of 60% of free cash flow. So we've never guided to that 60% as being a specific target, it's always been a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow. The reason we like that guide is, honestly, it's pretty simple and dynamic, it's easy to understand and communicate.  The minimum of 60% is -- it can be supported over a range of price scenarios, especially when there's a pullback in prices. And really, we can underpin that with the growing sustainable regular dividend that we highlight and talk about so much. And that's what can provide really a meaningful amount of cash return through the cycle. Again, I do want to emphasize, we consider that regular dividend to still be the true hallmark of a strong and improving underlying business, and we like the message that it sends. We increased that regular dividend commensurate with the strength of the business, lowering the cost basis of the company, and also in consideration with strengthening our balance sheet.  More specifically to kind of payouts that you've seen this year, we do recognize the value of opportunistic buybacks as part of that cash return strategy is a way to create shareholder value. So I would say that really, the decision that you've seen is consistent with our overall capital allocation strategy where we buy back shares in an opportunistic manner as a means to return cash above and beyond that minimum of 60%, in addition, to our regular dividend and at times, instead of paying a special dividend. We basically evaluate that buyback, just like we do any of our other investment decisions, whether it's exploration or drilling high-return oil and gas wells or investing in infrastructure. It's how is that investment going to create long-term shareholder value. That's what we primarily focus on.  And so the percent will fluctuate depending on a specific moment and time and what the circumstances are around our cash return strategy. But what we have guided to and what you can bank on is it's the minimum of 60% now. We highlighted -- we paid 67% out last year, and we're very well positioned halfway through the year right now where we've already committed or paid 67%, as I highlighted in the script. And all -- for the Dorado timing, I'll hand it over to Billy. Billy Helms : Yes. Good morning, Paul. On Dorado, we had indicated earlier in the year that we were evaluating the potential to delay some of our completions in Dorado and we are consistent with that strategy. We elected to maintain our drilling operations there, and we're seeing the benefits of that decision to play through the efficiencies we're gaining on the operational side. And we've given some color on that in our new investor deck illustrating the improvements in drilling times there in that place.  So we're very pleased with that progress. But don't forget, our investment strategy includes a gas price of investing for $2.50. That's our premium price deck when it relates to gas prices. We certainly were watching inventory levels on the gas side and just prudently decided to delay a little bit of the completions there until we saw the fundamentals improve, and so we'll be just laying some of those completions as we go into the late this year, which pushes five wells into the next year. So that's simply the thinking on that. Operator : Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann of Truist. Neal, the line is yours. Neal Dingmann : Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. As for my questions on well productivity, specifically looking at that Slide 10 of yours, certainly it appears that your Delaware wells continue to notably improve, and so what I'm wondering is this driven more by just continued D&C efficiencies. Or is it more an informational targeting? I asked that, I just was looking at the bottom through the left corner of those pies. It looks like over the years, not only the wells improving, but it looks like they're becoming more focus on that Wolfcamp oil. So I'm just wondering what is driving that, it does look very positive. Ezra Yacob : Thank you, Neil. This is Ezra. I'm actually going to let Jeff Leitzell step in and address your question. Jeff Leitzell : Hi, Neil. This is Jeff. On our Permian productivity, we've been really happy with how the wells have performed in the Delaware through the first half of the year. So all of our primary targets, they're performing right now as forecasted or better. And I'd say this is primarily due to just our stacked pay co-development strategy in combination with the new completion design we talked about, which has continued to be really successful in our Wolfcamp targets. And in regards to that new completion design, just kind of a quick update, we're still observing a 20% increase in both first year production and EUR for both oil and BOEs in the Wolfcamp.  So for the full year of 2023, we're planning on bringing on about 70 total Wolfcamp wells with this new design, which is nearly twice the number we've completed in 2022. And also with it, as we talked about, we're continuing to test and expand the technique in other areas and targets in the Delaware Basin along with all across our emerging plays in our multi-basin portfolio. Neal Dingmann : It's very helpful. And then -- and sorry about that. My second question is just on OFS costs. In the past, you all have been among the best not only just what I would say renegotiating contracts, but I know in the past, you've been able to stockpile type at the right time and all those sort of things. I'm just wondering if maybe give us a little bit of details on how you see the market now? Billy Helms : Yes, Neal. This is Billy. So certainly, we're seeing the service prices start to soften. But these savings from lower service costs really probably won't manifest into a lower well cost until later this year and certainly into 2024. These leading-edge prices are falling across various products and services for the industry. And certainly, it varies depending on the product in the area. I'd add that there are several factors that kind of reflect kind of where our '23 capital program is. As a company, as you mentioned there, we focused on sustainable cost reductions through our operational efficiency gains.  As a result, we do seek out the highest performing equipment in cruise, super-spec rigs, electric frac fleets, et cetera. That's really less exposed to some of these headline inflation numbers that we're seeing on the more marginal and equipments on the spot market. And the second part of that is we really anticipate that service costs would moderate through the year when we put our plan together since rig count really peaked back in November, and we built our plan in February, expecting well costs would increase no more than 10% relative to this last year. So things are really playing out exactly the way we planned.  Another point there is we do try to secure about 50% of our well costs in the start of any given year that really helps insulate us from inflationary impacts to our activity levels. And then lastly, based on how we do manage our business, we are less exposed to the volatility in service cost in any given year.  And I would remind you, as you kind of alluded to there, our well cost really only increased about 7% last year compared to the over 20% inflation that we saw in the market. So yes, it really helps us kind of manage our activity level with confidence as we go through the year. And we'll certainly remained flexible as we look into next year to see how we can position ourselves for next year. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Arun the line is yours. Arun Jayaram : Yes, good morning. I was wondering if you could help us think about the second half oil production profile for EOG. It looks like your updated guidance points to a slight sequential decline in 3Q. And I just wanted to get some thoughts on to hit if there's still kind of confidence in hitting the midpoint of the oil guidance range because that would imply fourth quarter oil production number in the mid-480s to upper 480s. So help us think about the sequential movement in volumes in the second half of the year? Billy Helms : Yes, Arun, this is Billy. Yes, I think the thing to keep in mind is we do operate in more than one basin and multiple plays, and we have varying sizes of well packages in each play. So the timing of really the quarter-to-quarter variance in production is really driven by the timing on a quarter-to-quarter basis of how these packages across different plays come online. And even within the quarter, how that varies month-to-month within the quarter can vary -- can drive the volume profile.  And I would remind you, and I just ask you to go back and look at the change from the first quarter to the second quarter, it's actually larger than what you're seeing in the forecast from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So we would -- we are maintaining ratable activity throughout the year and just as a matter of simply timing on bringing on some of these larger packages. So, so far this year, we've either met or exceeded our volume forecast and have complete confidence in being able to meet the midpoint of our guidance. Arun Jayaram : Great. Just a follow-up, I wanted to get some thoughts on the Ohio Utica. One of the midstream providers highlighted how they're building out, call it, a backbone in the Utica looks like you may be the anchor E&P for that investment. But I'd love to get some thoughts on the Utica. We did see that you may be pulled your TIL guidance down a little bit this year, but just an update would be helpful. Lance Terveen : Arun, good morning. This is Lance. Yes, I would say what we're most focused on right now is just getting all the midstream infrastructure in place. So we do have two ongoing projects that are going on. We've got 1 in the north and then another one in the South as well. So what we're really focused on is linking our production to the available processing capacity.  And really, what's happening is it's a consistent strategy that we've done and all are plays, where we're going to have a balance of EOG-owned infrastructure along with strong relationships with really good working third parties. We're going to need both in the Utica Combo up there. And so right now, just focused on setting up 2024 and beyond with the infrastructure. Ken Boedeker : Yes, Arun, this is Ken. I just want to give you a quick update on the Utica. We're making excellent progress on that program this year. We do plan to bring a 4-well package online this month and our frac crew will be starting up again in a few weeks. So the wells we drilled and completed in 2022, we do continue to deliver our expected performance, and we also continue to add acreage and look for additional low-cost opportunities to add to our position up there. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Doug, the line is yours. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Ezra, it's a long time since we had to worry about the U.S. growing too quickly and all the whole market share battle issues that we all lived through over the last four, five years with OPEC. But in your opening remarks, you did talk about Saudi's decision to support the price or extended cuts. So I'm wondering when you sit in the boardroom and you look at what is an artificially high oil price because Saudi is cutting production arguably to support price.  How do you think about what that means for your business, the appropriate level of spending the right allocation of one could call it, windfall cash flow because it's not -- it's an artificially supported price by definition? So I'm just curious how you think about what that means to your business your cash flow is basically being subsidized again by Saudi. Ezra Yacob : Good morning, Doug, Thanks for the question. This is Ezra. Yes, it's a dynamic environment. We had a large SPR release last year that increased the inventory levels kind of entering this year. And as those have started to come down, now they're going to start all indications that they're going to start coming down significantly faster because OPEC Plus, as I said, it looks like they are going to support their cuts to kind of bring those inventory levels down. So your point is, it's a very interesting one, and it's one we discuss regularly, obviously, and we do different scenarios around.  So in general, what I'd say is, on this year, what we look at is whether it's crude products, gasoline, distillates, either globally or domestically, inventory levels are basically in the lower half of a five-year range. Now that's a choppy five years, like we said, because of 2020 with COVID and then, of course, with 2020 with half of the year being exceptionally low and then half of the year being somewhat artificially higher with the SPR.  Outside of the last month, the last month, we've seen kind of gasoline and distillate demand being just a bit weaker domestically. But otherwise, products demand has really been in line all year with our expectations. Crude demand, has continued to increase, continue to grow. And not only with the high inventory levels that we entered the year with, but really supply, I think, has surprised everybody a little bit to the upside. And it's not necessarily, as you pointed out, U.S. growth or new barrels, but it's really historically displaced barrels that are back online. And dominantly, what I'm talking about is Venezuela and Iran, and maybe a little bit of -- I think everyone has been a little bit surprised at least we have on the resiliency of the Russian barrels to hit the market.  So we don't forecast those as having a significant longer-term effect. And one thing that we think about when we talk about the spare capacity that's now offline with OPEC Plus is some of that spare capacity is really offsetting the previous spare capacity I just highlighted from Venezuela and Iran. So it is a little bit different from prior years. Ultimately, what we see is the increasing oil demand overall exiting this year, most estimates have it at least at 102 to exit the year, which would put us at a significantly high point.  Now to your ultimate question on how we actually look at that internally, our planning begins with everything we just talked about kind of an evaluation of the macro environment with respect to supply and demand fundamentals, including spare capacity that's off-line just by choice and spare capacity that's offline for true geopolitical reasons. But then more than that, Doug, it really does come down to evaluating across all of our premium assets both individually and collectively, we evaluate the correct investment level for each of those, the activity levels to make sure that each asset will deliver improved metrics year-over-year.  And ultimately, that will be driving optimized returns and free cash flow generation at the corporate level, and that's what will continue to set up EOG to create shareholder value in the near and long term. Honestly, the growth ends up being a real output of our ability to invest and continue to lower the cost basis of the company and provide both near-term and future free cash flow generation. Doug Leggate : An interesting dilemma. Ezra, thank you for your perspectives on that. A quick follow-up, hopefully, is a quick one. I wanted to touch on, I think this was asked earlier, but I wanted to elaborate just a little bit. The comments about inflation limiting to 10% this year, but it's too early to talk about 2024. You're pretty much the second to last company to have your earnings call this quarter. And pretty much everybody else has been pointing to, yes, we're going to see some deflation in 2024. I'm just -- are you just being conservative, or do you genuinely believe that there's still upside risk to capital in '24 from inflation, I mean. Billy Helms : No, Doug, I don't think we are anticipating that you'll see inflation into next year. I think what the comment was when we started out the year let me just clarify something. We saw inflation last year coming in the business. Rig counts kind of peaked in November of last year. We anticipated we would see a deflation in the market going into this year. And so we built our plan based on the fact that our well cost in 2023 would increase no more than 10% relative to 2022. So that's where the 10% comment comes from.  As we go into '24, I think we recognize and clearly, we're seeing deflation in our business. I'd say it's too early to predict what that level of deflation is going to do to our well cost next year. There's still a lot of market dynamics that we see in the business as Ezra just went through. And so it's early to predict what that impact that's going to have on next year's capital program as well as kind of how we choose to develop our plays across the different plays that we have to invest in. So that's the comment about too early for next year. It's just too early with the market dynamics we have for next year. Operator : Next question comes from Leo Mariani of ROTH Capital Partners. Leo, please go ahead. Leo Mariani : Yes, good morning. Just wanted to kind of touch base on some of the emerging plays, really thinking about kind of Utica and PRB. And also some of the undisclosed exploratory plays out there as well. Just trying to get a sense if generally speaking, you've seen any increased competition in these plays during the course of 2023. I mean it still seems like EOG being a bit of a lone wolf in pursuing some of these plays where others maybe aren't doing as much, but maybe there's more kind of going on behind the scenes that you guys can help out with here. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Leo, this is Ezra. Yes, we continue to see very limited competition domestically on any exploration, I think, and you can kind of see that to just in the public comments that are made. Most operators, companies, whether private or public, have really kind of picked the basin and are honing in on more of a drill down kind of specialist manufacturing mode. We continue to explore. And as Ken said, we're still looking to put on low-cost, high-quality bolt-on opportunities in some of those plays.  With respect to the Utica and PRB in specific. It's a little bit early this year on Utica. We're pleased with what we're seeing on the operations side. And as Ken said, we'll get a completion spread in there and get some results here coming up. On the PRB, we've had a very strong year. Everything has really fallen in the line there. And again, the PRB in Dorado are really benefiting from more of a continuous operations program this year as we focus on Austin Chalk and a little bit of co-development in the Eagle Ford and Dorado, and then we center most of our focus in the PRB in the Southern PRB is basically on the Mowry this year.  And then shifting to international for just a minute on the exploration side. As you guys know, we both explore onshore and offshore and shallow water internationally. I would say onshore, there's still limited competition on the exploration side for unconventionals in what we see. Of course, it's still a high bar that we have for international opportunities to -- they really do need to compete with our domestic portfolio. We're not just exploring internationally to try and say that we've got something internationally, it really needs to compete and deliver value for the shareholders. And then in the shallow water, probably a bit of the same, maybe a little bit more exploration out there. But dominantly, I think what you're hearing about in in offshore international exploration is a bit more in the deep and even ultra-deepwater and really in the shallow water that we're focused on. Leo Mariani : Okay. Appreciate that. Just wanted to turn to CapEx for a minute here. You talked about this a little bit in your prepared comments, but you guys are kind of at 50% of the budget in the first half kind of right on where you expected here. Looking at guidance, third quarter CapEx is up a fair bit versus second quarter. So do we expect to see kind of a commensurate drop in 4Q capital to kind of get you back to that kind of midpoint on the full year? Just trying to get a sense of kind of CapEx cadence in the second half? Billy Helms : Yes, Lee, this is Billy. So on the CapEx, I'd say our drilling and completion activity has been very ratable throughout the year, and we're pretty much on track with what our plan has laid out. The reason third quarter is up is simply due to the timing of our non-drilling and completion capital, and it moved from the second quarter into the second half of the year. Everything else, all of our drilling and completion CapEx is really on pace with what we laid out.  We've spent about half the CapEx for the year, and we've completed about half the wells that we're planning for the year. So I'd say everything is pretty much on track. But fourth quarter will be a reflection of how that non-D&C non-drilling and completion CapEx gets spent in the third. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Scott, the line is yours. Scott Gruber : Thanks. And good morning. I'll just go ahead and ask two questions up front here since they're related you guys know to continue the efficiency gains in the emerging plays. What are you seeing in terms of efficiency gains more broadly across the portfolio? Obviously, the gains are always greatest in the new plays, but I'm curious if you're still seeing solid gains more broadly across the portfolio. And if you are, without adding rigs and frac crews next year, just curious how much the overall well count could potentially grow next year just on the back of those efficiency gains? Is that a kind of low single-digit type figure potentially a mid-single-digit figure? Billy Helms : Yes, Scott, this is Billy. We're still seeing continued improvements, although as you noted, at a lesser pace than our more active foundational plays like the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford, simply because we've been active there for a long period of time. And as you noted, the emerging plays benefit from that transfer of technology more rapidly, I guess, than some of the existing plays.  And really, I'd just like to tie that back in a little bit. We still experiment quite a bit with applying technology across all of our assets and especially true of our foundational plays, the efforts we've gone to, to put in our data systems and track data across our plays gives us a lot of insights on how to -- how things are performing. That goes back to our bringing in-house our drilling tools, our drilling motors, those kind of things. So we still see improvements in some of our supplemental deck in the back, you can see some of the increase in drilling times say, in our Permian program, and how that's improved over time, and we continue to drive that down.  And so that's an effort there. And then the same for the Eagle Ford, I think those are some of the spots in the back of our deck. So we're still seeing improvements in both the drilling times and the completed lateral feet per day, and we're very encouraged with that because that enables the technology transfer enables quickly to go to the emerging plays and continue to reduce our cost. How that translates into next year.  Again, I'd say we're still a little bit early to see how things are going to play out on the macro side, depending on what the market looks like. So it's early to see, but I'm encouraged with the efficiency gains that we're seeing that we'll continue to find sustainable ways to improve our business and lower our cost basis going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Derrick Whitfield of Stifel. Derrick, please go ahead. Derrick Whitfield : Good morning, all. For my first question, I wanted to focus on long lateral development, which has been seen throughout Q2 and its development you're highlighting in the Eagle Ford with an over 15,000-foot lateral this quarter. As it relates to the Eagle Ford and perhaps more broadly for your portfolio, are there considerations beyond lease geometry and legacy development that would limit your ability to pursue more 15,000-foot laterals? Ken Boedeker : Yes, Derrick, this is Ken. Really, longer laterals are a way we're increasing our capital efficiency in the Eagle Ford. If you look at it, we've drilled over 85 wells with laterals over 2.5 miles long across the Eagle Ford. And we've utilized these longer laterals over the last five-plus years, where appropriate.  You think about it, the faulting across the Eagle Ford does make these longer laterals challenging, but our data-driven approach and multidisciplinary teams enable us to steer the laterals within some narrow target windows and apply an optimal completion design to maximize that capital efficiency. These longer laterals have really contributed to us lowering our cost basis in the Eagle Ford and are an example of how we're focused on increasing our efficiencies even in that play where we've been developing it for over 10 years. Billy Helms : Yes, Derrick, this is Billy. I just might add, the lessons we're learning from our longer laterals, we're pushing in the Eagle Ford, we're applying across all of our portfolio. And so we're seeing those opportunities across every asset that we have. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Neil, please go ahead. Neil Mehta : Thanks very much. The first question is just around Dorado. Maybe you could talk about how that's tracking versus your target. How do you think about the timing of recompleting those Dorado wells? Ken Boedeker : Yes, Neil, this is Ken. As far as the way that's tracking, the five wells that we've deferred, we would see that we'd be completing those early in next year. And it's still early in the play and the wells in our core area are really performing as we've anticipated. Neil Mehta : Timing dynamic. And then would love your perspective stepping back to talk about the M&A market. We've seen a pickup in consolidation throughout U.S. shale. How do you think of EOG's role in future consolidation? And is the best strategy given the exploration program that we've been talking about here is to continue organically to grow the business? Or do you think there are going to be opportunities [indiscernible] to bolt-on? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Neal, this is Ezra. I think we've been 30 years strong as an organic exploration company, 20 years separated there. And I think that's -- the thing about that is the way we look at these deals is that it's similar to how I described every investment decision is, it's a returns-based decision, and how is that investment going to create long-term shareholder value. We don't think of M&A versus exploration. But as a first mover, looking -- trying to capture the sweet spots of new plays, obviously, you can get a lower cost of entry and that offers a higher return. So the exploration, I think, organic exploration stands on itself. With regards specifically to M&As, we're aware of opportunities. We evaluate many, many opportunities. And the challenge with it always comes back to, is that opportunity really going to be additive to the corporate portfolio? Is it really going to be something that we -- is better than what we're already drilling is it's something that's going to add to the returns and add to the 10 billion barrels of equivalents that we've already captured as premium resources. And we continue just to evaluate opportunities, but kind of come up short with that evaluation. Operator : Our next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Roger please go ahead. Roger Read : Good morning. I'd like to come back to two things that have been discussed a little bit. One, Ezra, just you talked about the low carbon advantage or the emissions advantage of Dorado. I was wondering if you could go in a little more depth on specifically what you see there. And then my other question will be on the inflation side. With oil at 80, 85 right now, aren't we sitting in a situation where inflation pressures might be reversing rather than behind us? And if that's not the right way to look at it, I'd be curious what you are seeing that says deflation is the right track here. Ken Boedeker : Yes, Roger, this is Ken. I'll go ahead and answer the first part of that with Dorado. We're really confident that our gas production at Dorado generates significant returns and that development will be both operationally efficient and have a small emissions footprint because of the dry nature of the gas and really the proximity of that gas to the Gulf Coast markets. Billy Helms : Yes, Roger, this is Billy. On the inflation question, I think you're spot on. I think that's why we're saying, certainly, we see deflation in the market today, but it's too early to think about 2024 because of the dynamic markets that we're seeing play out. And we're kind of be patient and watch the market and see how it develops before we make any comments about where cost would go in 2024. I think as a company, we're certainly well positioned to take advantage of any opportunities that are presented in our strategy about contracting and seeking out the highest-performing crews are things that drive really our focus on sustainable cost improvements through the long term, and that's really what drives our advantage over trying to capture the premium barrel, premium price for all of our products. Operator : We have no further questions on the phone line. So I'll hand back to Mr. Yacob. Ezra Yacob : We appreciate everyone's time today on the phone call. Thank you to our shareholders for their support, and I just want to give a special thanks to our employees for delivering another exceptional quarter. Thank you, everybody. Operator : Thank you for joining. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir. Tim Driggers : Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This conference call includes forward-looking statements, factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those and our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release, and EOG's SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, definitions and reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures can be found on the EOG's website. In addition, some of the reserve estimates on this conference call may include estimated potential reserves, and estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SECs reserve reporting guidelines. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Leitzel, EVP Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP Marketing; and Piers Hammond, VP Investor Relations. Here's Ezra. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Over the past five years, EOG has increased production 33%, decrease per unit operating costs 17% generated over $20 billion of free cash flow and over $20 billion in net income. We've increased our regular dividend rate nearly 350% and including both regular and special dividends paid and committed to have returned about $13 billion directly to shareholders, all while reducing total debt by more than 40%. At the core of our historical and future success of EOG's employees who embrace and embody the EOG culture. And our third quarter results continue to reflect our employees outstanding execution, strong performance and our foundational Delaware basin and Eagle Ford assets, as well as continued progress across our emerging plays have delivered production volumes, capital expenditures, and per unit operating costs better than expectations, and enabled us to raise our full year oil production guidance and reduce our full year cash operating costs guidance. In addition to announcing third quarter results yesterday, we demonstrated our confidence in the outlook for our business by increasing the regular dividend 10%, announcing a $1.50 per share special dividend and raising our cash return commitment to shareholders beginning in 2024, to a minimum of 70% of annual free cash flow. Our annualized regular dividend is now $3.64 per share, which represents the highest regular dividend yield amongst our peers and is competitive with the broader market. This dividend increase reflects two things. First, the progress we continue to make on our cost structure by leveraging technology and innovation sustainably improves EOGs capital efficiency. Furthermore, we expect the advantages of operating in multiple basins will drive additional improvements to EOGs cost structure and returns and reduce the break-even oil price to fund the dividend in the years ahead. Today we estimate that we can maintain our current level of production and fund the $2.1 billion regular dividend commitment at an oil price as low as $45 WTI. Second, this dividend increase reflects our confidence in EOGs expanding portfolio of premium plays to grow the company's future income and future free cash flow. This quarter we've highlighted recent well performance results in the newest addition to our premium portfolio of assets, the Utica combo play. Over the last several years, our success in organic exploration continues to add low-cost reserves and consistently drive down our DD&A rate enabling EOG to create value through industry cycles. Beyond our regular dividend, which we've never cut or suspended, we raised our cash return commitment to shareholders to a minimum of 70% of annual free cash flow beginning in 2024. Alongside our portfolio of premium assets, and our cash flow margins EOGs balance sheet continues to strengthen allowing us to supplement the dividend with a larger commitment of future free cash flow through special dividends and share repurchases. In addition to the $1.50 per share special dividend declared yesterday, we executed additional opportunistic share repurchases for the third consecutive quarter. For 2023, we estimate our committed cash return will be about 75% of free cash flow. EOG continues to consistently execute lower our cost structure through innovation efficiencies, and organically grow the quality of our portfolio to improve capital efficiency and free cash flow potential. Our transparent cash return strategy is anchored to a sustainable growing regular dividend and backstopped by an impeccable balance sheet. EOG is in a better position than ever to deliver value for our shareholders through industry cycles and play a leading role in the long-term future of energy. Here's Tim to review our financial position. Tim Driggers : Thanks, Ezra. EOG delivered superb operating and financial performance in the third quarter. Oil production increased 4% year over year, while total production was up 9% year-over-year per unit cash operating costs declined by 5% from the prior year period. The DD&A rate fell by 9% year-over-year driven by the addition of reserves at lower finding costs compared to our production base. Capital Expenditures came in at $1.52 billion, $140 million below our target, mostly due to the timing of non-well related expenditures, such as infrastructure projects. Year-to-date, CapEx of $4.5 billion is 75% of the full year guidance. We earned adjusted net income of $3.44 per share in the third quarter, and generated free cash flow of $1.5 billion. We announced a $1.50 per share special dividend and during the third quarter we spent $61 million on share repurchases, bringing total 2023 share repurchases through the third quarter to $671 million, at an average price of $108 per share. In total, we're on track to return $4.1 billion of cash to shareholders this year, in the form of regular dividends, special dividends and repurchases. This equates to about 75% of our estimated 2023 free cash flow higher than our 2023 minimum commitment of 60% of annual free cash flow return to shareholders. Overall, it was a strong quarter driven by solid operational execution and improving capital efficiency. Here's Billy to review operations. Billy Helms : Thanks, Tim. EOGs operational performance continues to improve and this quarter is another example. We exceeded our third quarter forecast across the board on volumes per unit operating cost and CapEx. Thanks goes to our employees for consistently delivering the EOG value proposition quarter-after-quarter. Third quarter volumes exceeded guidance largely due to accelerated timing of activity within the quarter driven primarily by improved efficiencies, as well as some benefits from better well productivity. Efficiencies in our completion efforts have reduced the time to bring wells to sales. For example, in our Eagle Ford play, the completed lateral fleet per day has increased 19% year-over-year. The team has also reduced non-productive time by 31%, which is the added benefit of lowering total well cost. In addition, our new completion design continues to drive performance improvements in the Delaware basin, with targeted laterals realizing a 20% increase in productivity. Well productivity improvements is the primary reason we were able to increase the full year oil guidance by 1500 barrels of oil per day. Last quarter, we reduced our full year guidance for total unit cash operating cost, mostly due to lower release operating expense and reduced transportation cost. Our third quarter performance continued that trend. Our production teams are optimizing both production and cost through our many technology applications that allow for real-time decisions to maximize production and reduce interruptions of third-party downtime. These cross functional efforts by our production, marketing and information systems teams continue to pay dividends. Once again, we are lowering our guidance for full year cash operating costs by approximately 2% this quarter, bringing our total reduction since the start of the year to 3% or nearly $0.30 per BOE. Capital Expenditures in the third quarter were lower than expected due to timing of infrastructure projects, as well as variances in activity across our multi-basin portfolio. We expect to maintain our current levels of activity for the remainder of the year, and our full year capital guidance is unchanged. For 2024, we are currently evaluating this year's results as we develop our plans for each of our plays. As a reminder, we invest to generate returns and growth is a byproduct of the investments in our highly economic multi-basin portfolio. We are very pleased that the levels of activity across our portfolio are at a pace that allows for continuous learning and improvements, and thus we'd expect to maintain similar levels of activity through 2024. With the strong results we're achieving in our emerging plays, we anticipate a few additional wills in both the Utica and Dorado. As we typically do each year, we will remain focused on managing costs through the cycle by contracting for about 50% of services and leveraging our scale and consistent activity levels to build and maintain strong partnerships with service providers. As a result, we're able to take a longer-term view to sustainably lower well cost over time. This year is shaping up to be another solid year performance for EOG. And I remain excited about the opportunities we see through the remainder of the year and into 2024. Now here's Jeff to talk about the updates on the Utica play. Jeff Leitzell : Thanks, Billy. In addition to sharing new well results, I'd like to review a few unique characteristics of our Utica asset to provide distinct advantages including our low cost of entry, our mineral rights position, held by production status, geologic operating environment, and downstream infrastructure status. This year we added 25,000 net acres and have now accumulated 430,000 net acres predominantly in the volatile oil window across 140-mile trend running north to south. Our leasehold cost of entry remains less than 600 per net acre. We've also acquired 100% of the mineral rights across 135,000 acres of our leasehold. Mineral rights significantly enhance the value of this play by adding 25% to our production and reserve streams for no additional well cost or operating expense. Furthermore, over 90% of the Utica acreage is held by production and requires only a handful of wells to be drilled every year to maintain. The result is more control over our development to allow us to invest in an appropriate pace to capture and incorporate technical learnings and continually improve the play. Another unique advantage of the Utica is its geologic operating environment. Due to the place favorable geologic properties, the opportunity to drive down cost through efficiencies is significant. The target zone is both shallow and consistent, which lends itself easily to drilling 3-mile laterals, and we anticipate testing even longer laterals as we continue to delineate and collect more data. Consistent geology also allows for precise targeting of the very best most productive rock. We're able to regularly drill 99 plus percent in zone within a narrow 10-foot window. As a result, this play provides an excellent geologic environment for significant efficiency improvements and low-cost operations. On Slide 11 of this quarter's investor presentation, we highlighted our strong and consistent well result to span our acreage position from the north and to the south. Our initial 4-well Timberwolf package was drilled at 1000-foot spacing and has been performing well above type curve. These 3-mile laterals each deliver an initial 30-day production averaging 2150 barrels of oil equivalent and an 85% liquid cut. With a large amount of liquids in the product mix all of the wells we have drilled today support double premium potential across our acreage position. The Utica also has the advantage of abundant midstream infrastructure, the existing processing fractionation and residue build out eliminates the need for significant new build commitments, which was a well-recognized advantage when we evaluated the play. In the north, we have placed into service, a pipeline that runs east of our acreage into the market center. In the south, we have an established reliable third-party building out a new pipeline that is expected to be in service late this year. With these trunk lines in place investment will be limited to in-field gathering as we prepare for a modest increase in activity next year. Our current plans for 2024 are to run approximately one full drilling rig that will continue to test optimal well spacing and improve operational efficiencies. Our Utica asset is another textbook example of our differentiated approach to build a diverse portfolio of premium assets predominantly through low-cost organic exploration, which adds reserves at lower finding and development costs and lowers the overall cost basis of the company. The end result is continuous improvement to EOGs company-wide capital efficiency. Our track record of successful exploration and strong operational execution has positioned the company to create shareholder value through the industry cycles. Here's Lance with a marketing update. Lance Terveen : Thanks Jeff. In our South Texas Dorado play, we recently completed two projects to service future gas flows from this premium, dry natural gas play and natural gas treatment facility and the first phase of a 36-inch pipeline. The facility was recently placed in the service to treat gas from the Dorado play prior to transportation through our 36-inch natural gas pipeline to sales near [indiscernible], Texas. Both projects were delivered on time and under budget, a testament to our operational team and foresight to procure a pipe counter-cyclically, along with other long lead time materials. The second phase of the natural gas pipeline will kick off construction in early 2024 and is expected to be complete late next year. Phase 2 of the pipeline will terminate in the Agua Dulce, which provides access to three other pipelines with connectivity to the growing demand along the Gulf Coast and Mexico, and potential premium pricing relative to Henry Hub. Our pipeline will be instrumental in expanding our gas sales options for the 21 TCF of net resource potential we've captured in Dorado, and perhaps more importantly, save $0.20 to $0.30 per MCF in transportation costs over the life of the asset versus third-party alternatives. Now here's is Ezra to wrap up. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Lance. EOG continues to deliver on our value proposition and our approach remains differentiated for several reasons. First, our premium return standard investments are governed by one of the highest hurdle rates in the industry 30% direct after-tax rate of return using $40 oil, and $2.50 natural gas pricing. Second is organic exploration, by prioritizing organic exploration we add inventory and reserves at lower finding and development costs. Third, our assets are unique. By remaining focused on the first two returns and organic exploration, we have built one of the largest highest return lowest cost and most diverse portfolios of assets in the business. We operate in 16 plays across nine basins and have a mass resources of 10 billion barrels of equivalents with an average finding and development cost of just $5 per barrel. At our current production level, that's equivalent to about 30 years of low cost, high margin inventory, and our assets continue to grow. Fourth is technology. We have never considered as a manufacturing process. We leverage both infield technology and information technology to improve well productivity and efficiencies. Our goal is to lower costs and expand our margins to constantly improve our existing assets and new discoveries. Thanks for listening. Now we will go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Scott Hanold : Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on the strong quarter. Ezra, I think it was pretty notable, the way you all took a step up in your fixed dividend payments. I mean, you've got a history of doing that, but it was a good step up this quarter, in addition to boosting the shareholder return program to 70%. So, can you talk about some of the more significant factors like, why make those pretty pronounced moves now? Is there something in the business model, you guys get more confidence at this point to make those moves? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Scott, thanks for the question. The decision to raise minimum cash return to 70%. Overall, it just demonstrates our commitment our shareholders. It reflects our continual improvements since the initial commitment was made nearly two years ago. And really to your question on the business model change, it's really just our ability to deliver that shareholder value. It's grounded in the fact that our strong cash return generation capacity continues to improve the strength of our industry leading balance sheet continues to improve and our commitment again to just being disciplined with our reinvestment across the entire portfolio. So we're in a position now where we feel very confident that and proud that we can increase that minimum commitment to 70%. And we look forward to being able to deliver that to the shareholders. Scott Hanold : So when you look at those breakeven points to do that, sort of this base business, is that breakeven point then lowered from, say, where you were a year or 2 ago to where it is now? Ezra Yacob : Yes. That's right, Scott. As we continue to invest in these higher-return, lower-cost reserves and bring them into the base business, we continue to do some strategic infrastructure spending to lower the overall cost of the company going forward. That continues to expand the free cash flow potential of the company. And that, in addition to strengthening the balance sheet, everyone knows we retired a $1.25 billion bond earlier this year, and we've been able to be not only net zero but actually put a little bit of cash on the balance sheet. All of those things are what gives us confidence in the base business going forward and the fact that we can continue to increase this minimum cash return to our shareholders from the 60% up to the 70%. Operator : The next question comes from Leo Mariani of ROTH MKM. Please go ahead. Leo Mariani : You guys spoke about sort of similar '24 activity versus 2023, but also kind of said that there might be a handful of more wells in the Utica, in the Dorado. So I just kind of wanted to get a sense there. I mean, do you see this as kind of a give-and-take proposition, where if you do a little bit more in some place, you might have kind of a few less wells and some other plays? And just trying to get a sense of how maybe costs are trending overall in wells today. Billy Helms : Yes, Leo. This is Billy. Yes, as far as 2024, certainly, it's too early to get into many specifics about the plan. But I would say that our plan will be based on a couple of different factors. One would be the macro environment, kind of what that looks like going into next year. The other one is really governed by what's the optimum level of activity across each of our plays that supports the objective of having continuous improvement. And so on that, on our core plays say, our foundational plays, the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin, we're very pleased with the activity levels we currently have there. And we'd expect to maintain similar levels of activity in those plays. We see the advantage of that is we are seeing continued improvement in each one of those plays, as we've talked about already on this call, And then, for our emerging plays, the Utica and the Dorado, for instance, we're very pleased with the results we're seeing to date. And so as we move into next year, we certainly want to continue that learning, and you may see a few additional wells in those plays on top of what we've done this year. As far as the cost trends, that's one reason we like to maintain these levels of activity. It allows us to improve our cost basis, improve operationally on how we're executing these wells, and we're seeing the benefits of that play out. So I'll maybe leave it at that and see what your follow-up is. Leo Mariani : Okay. No, that's helpful. So maybe just to kind of jump over to the Utica. Obviously, you brought a new package of wells online here. I know it's sort of early days, but when you look at these wells, do you tell yourself that you've already been able to see some improvement over the last year? Just trying to get a sense, are these wells a little better than they were, say, a year ago? And then on the cost side, in the Utica, are you starting to see maybe the cost come down a little bit here? Or maybe it's kind of early. I think you've had a target of sort of sub-$5 F&D, just not really sure kind of where you're at today. Jeff Leitzell : Yes. Thanks, Leo. No, we're really excited about the latest package that we brought on. That's our Timberwolf package that we highlighted on Slide 11. It's in a 1,000-foot space test. And of note there, as we've talked about our new completion design down there in the Permian and the Wolfcamp, we were able to go ahead and implement that on that. And as you can see from the initial results that we talked about, the 30-day IPs on that or 2,150 BOE per day over that 30-day period. So really excited about how that's turning out from the spacing test. We have an additional package. We actually highlighted in our slide deck, Xavier. We're going to tighten the spacing on that to 800 foot, and we should have results coming on here fairly shortly. So we're very excited with the results. And with that application of new completion design, it's going to be tough to tell if that's really what the big mover is, but we're extremely excited about the results that we're seeing so far. And from a cost standpoint, we really haven't disclosed specific costs in the Utica. We're still in the early stages, as we talked about in learning in this play. We've got a lot of room for operational efficiency gains. We've got some infrastructure, small infrastructure to develop that we can install like water gathering, reuse and sand to drive down costs. And then as we said, with the well results we're seeing, we feel really confident in supporting that sub-$5 F&D cost. Operator : The next question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead. Arun Jayaram : Ezra, I wanted to get your thoughts maybe at a high level in 2024. On the third quarter call of last year, you provided some soft [Technical Difficulty]. I was wondering if you could maybe give us some thoughts on overall, how you see the year kind of playing out. If I look at consensus forecast, it's for about $6.1 billion of CapEx with [Technical Difficulty]. So I want to get your thoughts if you could give us some soft guidance around next year. Billy Helms : Yes, Arun. This is Billy. Let me try to weigh in on that for you. And I apologize if I missed some of your question, you were breaking up a little bit there. As far as 2024, as I said earlier, it's a little bit early to give specifics on the plan, but I would say just look at our activity levels we're seeing today. And I would expect to see similar levels of activity on our core foundational plays going into next year, give you some hint as to what activity levels we might have. I would expect a few additional wells next year in our emerging plays, such as the Utica and maybe Dorado. And then, as far as service costs, let me just weigh in a little bit on that while we're talking about that. We certainly understand service costs have moderated in the industry as industry activity has dropped throughout the year. The magnitude of those declines certainly varies between the services and in which basins we're operating in. We remain focused on just continuous improvement that we see in our efficiency gains throughout our operations. So we tend to use the latest technology in the highest-performing crews, which includes super-spec rigs and frac fleets. That equipment continues, as you know, to be in high demand with service pricing proving to be more resilient. We have seen drops in tubular and casing costs for next year that will tend to reduce overall well cost. But again, the magnitude of that effect on overall well cost is yet to be quantified. So as we go into next year, certainly, we expect to maintain our activity levels that we see in our core plays, a few extra wells, some softening on well cost. Overall, I think that's kind of where we're headed. Arun Jayaram : Okay. Fair enough. Maybe one for Jeff. Jeff, if you can give some more details. You've provided your Utica type curve on Slide 11. Just wanted to get a sense of is that type curve for the entire play? Is it for the volatile oil window only? And would that be representative of both the North and the Southern portions of the play? Jeff Leitzell : Yes. That would just be the general type curve in mix across the 140 miles kind of from North to South there in the play. So it's pretty consistent. You can see on the slide that we put our first handful of wells on there, and that's really what a lot of the type curve was going to be built off. And you can see the Timberwolf package is the most recent one that we brought on and the outperformance in that one. Operator : The next question comes from Philips Johnston of Capital One Securities. Please go ahead. Philips Johnston : Just a few quick follow-ups for Jeff on the Utica. First, on the 55% oil cut, what sort of API are we talking about on that crew? Or is it more of a quasi-condensate type of mix there? Lance Terveen : Hey, Philip. This is Lance. Yes, what we're seeing is still early, but what we're seeing is kind of APIs in kind of the 40s to 50s. Philips Johnston : Okay. Sounds good. And then, the wells so far are pretty much all been up along the eastern edge of the acreage. And I'm pretty sure you guys have previously cited the black oil window. It's sort of in the exploratory phase still. But how does the geology change as you go West? And when would you expect to test other parts of your acreage? Jeff Leitzell : Yes. Good question. So to kind of start off, why do we started off on the East, really the big reason with that is just we had good quality seismic data over on the east side of it when we were first starting out. And obviously, that's really important, so you can get a really good look at the detailed subsurface, any kind of drilling hazards to make sure you perform really, really clean tests. So where we started, where that seismics at, obviously, we started the delineation. We've got spacing tests in place. And then as we start to zero in on that spacing, we'll be able to kind of step out more to the west and be able to apply some of those spacing techniques to start developing out there. But we do know there's going to be variation in productivity. And as you did state, we do expect it to get more oilier as you do move out to the west. Operator : The next question comes from Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Neal Dingmann : I'll maybe stick with the Utica. Just my first question, typically, would your AMI in the eastern side of the play limit in any way thoughts about incremental activity or potential additional acquisitions in that Eastern oil window? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Neal, this is Ezra. We're pretty happy with the footprint that we've been able to put together since we entered the play. I think we highlighted on the call that we've added an additional 25,000 acres, bringing our total up to 425,000 acres at very low cost. And let me just highlight again that we actually own the minerals across 130,000 mineral acres down in the southern portion of the play. So when we look at it right now, as Jeff said, we're drilling some initial spacing packages, some delineation tests where we currently have seismic. We're also this year acquiring seismic in a couple of different parts of the play. So we can continue to step out and gather results on that and provide a bigger better estimate of what we've captured here for you guys. As far as being limited on incremental activity. I want to think of it that way. Like I said, we've put together a very large contiguous acreage position. And really, our activity right now as far as investment in pace, as Billy said, is going to be determined on our ability to collect data and integrate the production data that we're seeing back into the front-end of our geologic models. The activity is really always considered to be at a pace where we can continue to learn and incorporate those learnings on the next set of wells. Neal Dingmann : Great details, Ezra. And then just to follow up, I want to make sure, I'll stick with the Utica. Just it sounds like you have more than ample takeaway if I hear right, on the Southern Utica, but I just want to make sure it was clear for plans on the Northern portion that. Bill, I think you're one of the guys just talking about it. Maybe just talk about the infrastructure plans and if that would capture any of the upside if you decided to boost activity in that northern area. Lance Terveen : Yes, Neal. This is Lance. Good morning. I think what makes this place so unique is that it is just positioned to so much existing capacity. I mean, actually, in fact, when -- there's even some idle processing capacity and fractionation, ideal processing capacity that's nearby on our acreage. So when we look at that just from an infrastructure standpoint, we've been focused on more just the gathering infrastructure. And as Jeff mentioned, we put into service our pipeline in the North and then we're going to have a pipeline in the South as well. So we're going to have plenty of running room, just long-term running room as we think about the infrastructure that we're putting in place along with third parties and then also the available capacity that's in place. Operator : The next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate : I'm not loving the new dial-in system, but thanks for getting me on. Ezra, I wonder if I could hit first two things. I want to hit the cash return change and the evolution of the portfolio as you look forward. So dealing first with the 70% number, that obviously is subject to whatever the level of capital is. And I guess, the flow on the machine is that 60% of free cash flow or 70% of free cash flow is still free cash flow, which means it's entirely dependent on what you decide as a discretionary spending, which to me doesn't mean a whole lot. So what commitment can you give or at least guidance or framework for what the level of spending looks like in order for us to interpret what the increase in free cash flow commitment actually means? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Doug, it's a good question. We based our cash return model on free cash flow for a couple of reasons. It's simple but it's also pretty dynamic, and it's close to the intentions that we have over a range of different price scenarios. So we're not entering into an area where we need to modify the commitment going forward. It's something that once we come out with that commitment, hopefully, our shareholders can see by our track record that once we come out with something, we're very consistent with it. The 70% return is a minimum of free cash flow is pretty consistent with our longstanding strategy, I would say, to build shareholder value and position the company to be able to do it through industry cycles. And that means that reinvestment at the right pace in our high-return inventory, that's the best thing we can do to create shareholder value. Ultimately, the cash return strategy, it begins with our commitment to a growing and sustainable regular dividend which, again, we raised that. We increased that just 10% and that dividend has never been cut or suspended over the 25 years that we've been paying one. In addition, we've committed now to return either additional specials or buybacks to reach that 70% minimum commitment. For us, hopefully, the increased commitment, the reason we like the 70% of free cash flow is, it's consistent with our free cash flow return in that it puts the emphasis on our regular dividend, which we think is peer-leading and competitive with S&P 500. And again, we feel that we can maintain current levels of production and cover that base dividend at WTI prices as low as $45. Doug Leggate : I appreciate the new breakeven number, Ezra. That's very helpful. Thank you. My follow-up is on portfolio evolution because, I guess, we all know that 10 years is not the number, I guess, for EOG. But yet your slide deck continues to refer to 10 years of double premium. So if I assume that's dominated by the Eagle Ford and the Permian given that you're happy with that level of activity, how does it evolve if the next leg of growth is Dorado, Utica in terms of mix? And I guess what I'm really driving at is, our channel checks on midstream suggests you could potentially be drilling north of 300 wells in the Utica in 2026. Does that sound reasonable to you in which case, what's the implication for mix? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Doug, I'm not going to speculate on 2026. As Billy said, it's a little bit early to be speculating on 2024. What I'd come back to is our disciplined base of investment. We have a lot of flexibility in the Utica. Specifically, we've got over 90 or roughly 90% of the acreage there is held by preexisting production. We only have a minor drilling commitment there. So we're in a great spot where we can actually develop that asset in a disciplined ability to increase activity commensurate with the increase of our learnings. Now overall, your question is recently our exploration efforts have yielded very high return, more combo plays, or in Dorado case, a gas play, and that's true. And there's something to be said for that. Our exploration and emphasis, I would say is dominantly more oil-focused because the margins are a bit more forgiving on oil from what we see. But ultimately, with our premium investment hurdle rate, and that's at bottom cycle pricing of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas through the life of the asset, we're somewhat agnostic to the product mix. Now it does require a heavy lift, by Lance, to discover new market potentials for us. And we continue to invest in different parts of the infrastructure and supply chain to lower our costs and lower our break-evens. But ultimately, we're investing in high-return assets and we continue to build out the inventory in a high return framework. More than the 10 years of double premium drilling, I think I'd steer you towards the 10 billion barrels of equivalents overall that is, at a finding and development cost, lower than our current DD&A rate. And as I said in the opening remarks, that contemplates maintenance levels at current levels of production, roughly 30 years of production. So we're very confident in the high-return inventory that we put together and believe that it's going to continue to deliver great shareholder value in the future. Operator : The next question comes from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead. Charles Meade : Billy, I'm going to make one more run at the '24 outlook. I think you've laid out that the activity levels are going to be pretty similar to '23. If I look at or if I try to think about the big moving pieces, you're going to have some efficiency gains, some capital efficiency gains, especially as some costs come down. On the other side, you have a slightly higher base production. So is it a reasonable stake in the ground to think that you guys can have similar results of '23 in the sense of low single-digit oil growth and kind of low-teens NGL and natural gas growth? Billy Helms : Thanks, Charles. Yes, this is Billy. For '24, we've kind of said it's a little early to get specifics about things. But I would point you to the fact that we're running at a pretty decent level of activity now. We're going to maintain that same level of activity going into next year. Now just a reminder, we're spending about $6 billion on our CapEx program this year, and it has proved to be fairly ratable through each quarter of the year. Similar levels of activity, there will be some upward movement maybe on efficiency gains. Like you said, we'll have a little bit more efficiency gains to factor in maybe some cost reductions due to casing cost, those kind of things. We'll still have some infrastructure spend. We may drill a few more wells in the Utica and Dorado plays. And we're trying to quantify that as we go towards the end of the year. But directionally, that kind of hopefully points you towards what next year might look like. We're not going to see a big ramp up in activity in any play as we see today, small changes in capital efficiency and well cost as we go into next year, we have some infrastructure spend. Charles Meade : Got it. Thank you, Billy. And then, I'm not sure who this would be best for, but I'm curious about your 3-mile laterals in the Utica. It seems to me like you're pleased with the results because you mentioned that you're even considering longer laterals in the Utica. But curious if you could address that point? And then also whether we can expect to see 3-mile laterals in other key plays for you guys? And if yes, where, or if no, what's special about the Utica that it works there and not in other places? Billy Helms : Yes. Charles. This is Billy again. Let me give you kind of an overview and then Jeff may add some more color. The 3-mile laterals in the Utica, yes, we're very excited about that play and its ability to do these longer laterals very efficiently on the operational side. We're drilling these things in record times and making progress with each pattern of wells we drill. And we feel we have line of sight on being able to continue to reduce cost over the longer-term period as we apply learnings from other plays into this area. So that's going to continue. Now we're also drilling longer laterals in some other plays. We've drilled some 3-mile laterals in the Eagle Ford and we're drilling 3-mile laterals in the Delaware Basin. So we expect that trend to continue in each of our plays. Now Jeff might want to add some colors on what we're seeing on performance there, too. Jeff Leitzell : Yes. Just a little bit to add in. In the Delaware, in the Eagle Ford and in Utica, we've had great operational efficiency with our 3-mile laterals. And that's one of the things, as you start stretching out the length of these laterals, you want to make sure that operationally you don't have any issues on the drilling side and you're able to optimally complete that. And we've seen really, really good results with that. The other thing we're also seeing is by drilling these longer laterals, we're able to supplement 1 vertical with a 3-mile lateral versus 2 verticals and a 2-mile lateral. So we're able to see substantial cost savings there anywhere from kind of 15% to 25%. So we're definitely excited about where we're seeing it. Obviously, it ties in with our leasehold, and we have to see where we can actually drill 3-mile laterals. But we are looking to expand that across our plays moving into next year and beyond. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Scott Gruber : The enhanced completion technique in the Delaware appears to be a success, if I heard correctly, 20% uplift in productivity. But there has been a question regarding applicability as you've talked about in the past. What's your latest thinking on how widely applicable the technique is across the play? And will there be an increase in the number of wells completed with the technique next year? Jeff Leitzell : Yes, Scott. Just there's no major updates this quarter, especially just in the Permian with the Wolfcamp. We're still seeing the outstanding strong results that we talked about earlier. Consistently 20% uplift in the first year production in EOR. The thing I would say is there in the Permian, we do have a handful of tests up in the shallower targets, and that's really where our focus is shifting out there. We hope to bring those on towards the end of this year and kind of the first half of next year. And once we get those results, we'll go ahead and share those with. But then around the rest of the plays, we talked about in the Powder River Basin, we do have a test in the ground we're currently evaluating there. And then more so over in the Utica, obviously, we started applying that with all of our new designs there. So seeing good results, but we're still just kind of collecting data and we'll see exactly what formations that we have success with moving forward. Scott Gruber : Got it. And then a follow-up on the South Texas pipeline. Does the completion of Phase 2 of the pipeline later next year influence how you think about the cadence of activity in Dorado? Are you inclined to add rigs into the play later in '24 to set the stage for a stronger growth once the pipeline is complete? Billy Helms : Yes, Scott. This is Billy. Phase 2, first of all, we're very excited about that project. Getting that pipeline is going to give us access to multiple markets in that basin. The pace of activity in Dorado is really governed by our learnings and results more so than the pipeline date. Certainly, we're excited about the pipeline, because as Lance laid out, it's going to allow us to save $0.20 or $0.30 in Mcf over the life of those reserves, which is 21 Tcf of reserves, But the pace of activity is really governed by how we see the macro and our learnings as we progress to play really independent of the pipeline. Lance Terveen : And then this is Lance, too. Some of the other strategic things we've done as you think about Phase 2, once we go in service, just to start, we already have existing capacity with other existing markets that are in place. But as Billy mentioned, really excited about getting to what we're going to potentially see as premium markets because we've got offtake agreements already in place, 2 of those which are very strategic. One of those, obviously, is with Cheniere and excited to see the development and momentum they're getting with the Stage 3 facility where we'll be a big piece of. And then, just two, the Transco, we'll have a strategic connection there. And that's going to give us access all the way up essentially the Gulf Coast Corridor, getting all the way into the premium market. So again, really excited about that as well, just from an offtake capability as well. Operator : The next question comes from Derrick Whitfield of Stifel. Please go ahead. Derrick Whitfield : I have two questions related to topics not covered yet. So first question, I wanted to focus on your CCS pilot, was the benefit of a year of experience in the pilot. I wonder to see if you could speak to some of the learnings to date and applicability of the pilot to your larger operations as a means to achieve net zero. Billy Helms : Yes, Derrick, this is Billy. Yes, the CCS pilot project, we're very excited about that project, what we've learned and how we can move forward with the play. So as far as how we've learned, there's a lot of operational things we've kind of uncovered as we develop that project, how we think about the CO2 we're sequestering, how we store it, how we move it, the pipeline infrastructure, the equipment we need, those kind of things. But also technically, what we've learned there as well. One thing we bring to the table on all these CCS projects, we have an immense amount of understanding of geological areas to store the carbon and our ability to map out those zones. And then we're also very good at drilling wells. So applying those 2 things give us some advantage on projects as we move forward. What we've learned in some of the monitoring we've done so far is very supportive of our initial thoughts on the play and how we can store the CO2 and observe its movement in the ground and be able to have confidence that we can store that for a sustainable period of time. So we're learning a lot. We're very pleased with the results we're seeing. Now we're also looking beyond our pilot project to see where else we can apply that technology. And it's early to say yet where we're going to take that, but needless to say, we're encouraged with what we're doing and excited about the opportunities moving forward. Scott Gruber : Great. And then, second, I wanted to lean in on your shallow water exploration schedule. With offshore drilling rig rates approaching historic levels and industry messaging sustained strength, how does that impact your views on the timeline for exploration wells and, more importantly, development activities, assuming exploration success? Billy Helms : Yes, Derrick. This is Billy again. Certainly, for offshore, as you mentioned there, the rig utilization is pretty tight or I'd say it's pretty high. So the market remains pretty tight on offshore rigs. We are very happy and pleased with the activity we have ongoing in Trinidad. We've been in the Trinidad, just a reminder, we've been in Trinidad for over 30 years. And currently, we have line of sight on probably one of our longest running programs we've ever had in the history of that play. And so we've secured a rig there for that operation and very pleased with the results we've seen to date. So now moving forward, as far as our exploration activity, certainly we're interested in pursuing other shallow water offshore opportunities in the company, and mainly because we've built quite a bit of expertise of drilling these offshore wells very efficiently and cost competitively compared to the industry. So we think that gives us a strategic advantage being able to pursue these kind of opportunities around the world. So we're continuing to look for those opportunities. And certainly, those opportunities would factor in the cost of doing business today the current offshore rig environment. And they'd have to be competitive with what we're doing in the rest of our portfolio. So looking at it that way, we see opportunities to continue to pursue that and excited about what that looks like going forward. Operator : The next question comes from Nitin Kumar of Mizuho. Please go ahead. Nitin Kumar : Why don't we go back to the Delaware for a minute? As I look at your slides, and there were 2 things that you were doing in the Delaware this year. You were also increasing the mix of your Wolfcamp oil in the drilling schedule and then there were the enhancements that you made. Could you break out the improvement that you're seeing between the mix and then the new technologies that you're talking about? Jeff Leitzell : Yes. This is Jeff. The first thing I'd say is in the Delaware, our technical teams, they're doing an outstanding job of continuing to build on their understanding of the subsurface geology, their geologic models. And really what they're focused on is increasing the value of each of our development units by maximizing and improving the overall NPV. So really, we look at it from kind of a total bench standpoint when we go into development. Now when we're looking at productivity and you talk about that, the wells are looking outstanding and we're kind of seeing a marked improvement year-over-year. We've seen good increase in productivity across the majority of our benches, and really the Wolfcamp as about a lot is kind of leading the way due to that new completion design. But the one thing that we always want to go ahead and highlight is, we have a large acreage footprint, over 400,000 acres. We've got high number of unique targets that we co-develop based off the very unique geology in each one of these areas. So you're going to see when you look at individual well results or even roll-up for the play, you're going to see that quarter-to-quarter variations in productivity and well performance. But ultimately, we're really happy with all the results that we see and it's hitting all the expectations and we have all of that built into our forecast. Nitin Kumar : Great. I guess the reason I'm asking this question is one of your peers in the play has talked about improving recovery rates, not just optimizing the well but actually improving recovery rates with the application of technology and they've talked about 20% gains. So I guess, given your experience in shale and, of course, your track record, I'm curious to see if you have seen technologies or are seeing technologies that could help that recovery factor increase not, just optimizing the wells but really a step change in what you're drawing from the rock. Billy Helms : Yes, Nitin. This is Billy. Let me give you a little more color on that in general. As far as the recovery factor, we're constantly improving or working to improve the long-term recovery in all of our plays, and it's something that goes really back to the foundation of the company and is something historically we've done, as you mentioned. We leverage a lot of technology to help us understand how we're targeting those plays and how we're completing each well. And so it involves a lot of things. And let me just talk about that in the sense of how we think about it. I mean, these unconventional plays, the completion efficiency is really important how we evolve over time. And so just thinking about how we've applied new technology, it goes back several years where we talked about the frac design itself, how we change the way we attack the well from the type of sand we pump, the spacing of the perforations, the cluster spacing, the frac rate, how we target reservoirs, our understanding geologically of how we understand the best place to place the target so we can co-develop like zones and those kind of things. So that evolution over time has caused us to see dramatic improvements in production, which is a proxy for a recovery factor over time. And the most recent example is, this is what Jeff just talked about, the improvements we've seen in our Wolfcamp play. And you can readily see, the 20% uplift we're seeing in completions in production performance is due to the completion approaches. So all those things over time lead to improved recovery factor. Operator : Next question comes from Josh Silverstein of UBS. Please go ahead. Josh Silverstein : Just on the updated 70% shareholder return level. How are you thinking about excess free cash flow beyond this? Will you look to increase the exploration budget, or could you, in theory, increase the shareholder returns to 90%? Any thoughts would be helpful here just to get the cash balance can keep growing substantially next year and there's no maturity until 2025. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Josh. This is Ezra. Ultimately, I think the answer to your question is that 70% is a minimum hurdle. In the last couple of years since we first came out with the initial cash return guidance, we had a minimum cash return commitment of 60%. In 2022, we were at 67%, and this year you see that we're on track to be north of 70%, probably closer to 75%. So I think that's the way you should be thinking about the guidance on there. And really, the big thing with our free cash flow commitment, it's a minimum of that 70%. But again, it's really founded in and hopefully, it doesn't remove the focus from our regular dividend. The regular dividend, we feel, is the best indicator of a company's ongoing performance, the improved capital efficiency going forward. And it's a commitment that we give to our shareholders based on our ability to continue to lower the break-evens and expand the sustainable future free cash flow generation in the company. It's backstopped with a pristine balance sheet. And in this quarter, when we raised it to 10%, One of the ways that we raised is by looking at what does it take on a breakeven there. And as we talked about before, we can support this new $2.1 billion regular dividend in commitment. At a range of maintenance CapEx scenarios, the higher end of that range would be with a $45 WTI price. And when I say a range of maintenance capital scenarios, let me be clear when I say that. For a company like ours that has multiple basins, differing amounts year-over-year of infrastructure spend or exploration, different product types. We look at maintenance capital through the lens of what does it take to keep production flat for a 5-year period, but also across those different investment scenarios. Are we investing in the health of the company longer term with exploration or are we really just narrowing it down to just a focus on maintaining production? And so we end up with basically a range of maintenance CapEx between $4.2 billion and $4.8 billion and so a midpoint of about $4.5 million. And as I said, at the higher end, that's where we can maintain that level with the $45 WTI. Josh Silverstein : Got it. And last for me. As you guys are thinking about the portfolio, how are you thinking about any kind of long cycle or conventional opportunities like Trinidad to kind of add in relative to bringing on some additional unconventional growth opportunities? Thanks. Billy Helms : Yes, Josh. This is Billy. Let me give you a little bit of hint maybe of kind of what we're looking at. Certainly, we have a deep portfolio of unconventional plays in the things we're currently drilling today. But our active exploration program is continuously looking for all opportunities. And they're geared towards, first of all, generating solid returns and being competitive with what we're investing in today. So they will include things that are conventional or unconventional, offshore or onshore, U.S. or not. So we're looking at all kinds of things that are competitive with what our portfolio is generating today. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Yacob for any closing remarks. EzraYacob: Yes. I'd just like to say that we appreciate everyone's time today. One final takeaway I'd like to leave you with is that EOG's cash return announcements in the third quarter demonstrate our commitment to creating long-term value for our shareholders. We've increased our free cash flow payout minimum to 70% and increased our regular dividend 10%, and we're confident in the sustainability of our regular dividend due to the consistent execution of our value proposition that improves the company year-after-year. EOG is in a better position than ever to deliver value for our shareholders through industry cycles and play a leading role in the long-term future of energy. Thank you.

This conference call may also contains certain historical and forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures and related discussion can be found on EOG's website. In addition, some of the reserve estimates on this conference call may include estimated potential reserves, as well as estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, President; Jeff Leitzel, Chief Operating Officer, Ann Janssen, Chief Financial Officer, and Lance Terveen, Senior Vice President, Marketing. Here's Ezra. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Pearce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our outstanding performance last year demonstrates that EOG's value proposition delivers results. We beat our volume targets and reached a production milestone, exiting the year producing more than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. We earned adjusted net income of $6.8 billion for a return on capital employed of 31%. We generated $5.1 billion of free cash flow and returned more than 85% of that free cash flow to shareholders last year, handily outpacing our cash return commitment. Our regular dividend remains the anchor of our cash return strategy. We increased it 10% last year to an annualized rate of $3.64 per share, which represents among the highest regular dividend yields of our peers and is competitive with the broader market. 2023 was a year of record production and outstanding financial performance, and it's not a one-off year. The real power of EOG's value proposition is consistency. Over the last three years, since the start of 2021, EOG has generated about $20 billion of adjusted net income, over $18 billion of free cash flow, and returned over $12 billion to shareholders. EOG delivers reliable operating results that translate to consistent financial performance year after year through the cycle. And that's EOG's value proposition, sustainable value creation through industry cycles. Our strategy to deliver on that value proposition starts first with capital discipline, a returns-focused capital allocation strategy guided by our premium hurdle rate, which requires investments to earn at least 30% direct after tax return at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. Capital discipline allows EOG to consistently achieve its free cash flow priorities and deliver on shareholder return commitments, positioning EOG as a compelling investment competitive with the S&P 500. The second principle of our strategy to deliver on our value proposition is operational execution. Our multi-basin organic growth portfolio is a competitive advantage. We have superior in-house technical expertise that supports leading-edge well performance while minimizing well costs. Our proprietary information technology enables real-time data-driven decision-making. We actively avoid falling into manufacturing mode where one well design is stamped out across a basin. Rather, we adhere to the discipline of continuous improvement such that the latest learnings get embedded into the next well and transferred to the next basin. Integrated into our operations is our focus on sustainability, the third leg of our strategy to deliver EOG's value proposition. Last year was a banner year with respect to our environmental performance. In addition to maintaining GHG and methane emissions intensity rates below our 2025 targets, we also achieved zero routine flaring throughout our operations. We achieved a wellhead gas capture rate of 99.9% and in the Delaware basin, our most active operational area, we increased water reuse to 90%. The final leg and foundation of our value proposition is EOG's culture. Our employees embrace and embody EOG's unique culture and are the number one reason for EOG's success. Collaborative multidisciplinary teams drive innovation and sustain the cycle of continuous improvement and our technology leadership. Our company is decentralized and non-bureaucratic to allow decision-making in the field at the asset level, which truly differentiates EOG relative to our peers and is a lasting competitive advantage. This culture is what drove our successful results in 2023 and provides the foundation to continue to deliver in the future. Ann is up next to discuss our cash return strategy and preview the details of our 2024 capital plan. Here's Ann. Ann Janssen : Thanks, Ezra. This morning, I'd like to review EOG's cash return strategy. A growing sustainable regular dividend remains the foundation of our cash return commitment, which is now a minimum of 70% of our annual free cash flow. We believe the regular dividend is the best indicator of a company's confidence in its future performance. It's a commitment to our shareholders based on our ability to continue to lower our cost structure and sustainably expand future free cash flow generation. Since we began trading as an independent company in 1999, we have delivered a sustainable growing regular dividend. It has never been cut or suspended and its 25-year compound annual growth rate is 21%. Last year, we announced an increase in our regular dividend of 10%. In fact, we have increased our regular dividend by at least 10% each year for the last seven years. The indicated annual rate is now $3.64 per share, which currently represents about a 3.2% regular dividend yield, among the highest in our E&P peer group. In addition to our regular dividend, we paid $2.50 per share in special dividends in 2023 and took advantage of increased market volatility to opportunistically repurchase shares. We bought back approximately 1 billion of our shares at an average price of $112 per share, repurchasing nearly 9 million shares. Since putting the $5 billion repurchase authorization in place over two years ago, the fundamental strength of our business has improved and we continue to get better through consistent execution of and commitment to EOG's value proposition. Last year, we also further strengthened our balance sheet by retiring $1.25 billion of debt. At year-end 2023, we had $5.3 billion in cash on the balance sheet, $3.8 billion in long-term debt, and over $7 billion of liquidity. We view a strong balance sheet as a competitive advantage in a cyclical industry. Our balance sheet is among the strongest in the energy sector and ranks near the top 10% in the S&P 500. Between our $1.9 billion of regular dividends, $1.5 billion of special dividends, $1 billion of buybacks, and retiring $1.25 billion of debt, 100% of EOG's 2023 free cash flow of $5.1 billion is accounted for. With a financial profile more competitive than ever with the broader market, EOG has never been better positioned to generate significant long-term shareholder value. This quarter, we included a three-year scenario on slide five of our investor presentation to illustrate our ability to create future shareholder value. We assumed a macro environment, commodity prices, and production growth comparable to the last few years for production that's low single-digit oil growth and high single-digit BOE growth per year. In the current environment, this pace of activity has delivered exceptional results, and we expect to deliver more of the same. Using a $65 to $85 oil price range and a $3.25 natural gas price through 2026, we would expect to generate between $12 billion and $22 billion in cumulative free cash flow and an average return on capital employed of 20% to 30%. At the midpoint, the scenario estimates $17 billion in cumulative free cash flow, which represents about one-quarter of EOG's current enterprise value. We believe this three-year scenario highlights an extremely competitive shareholder return profile not only among energy companies, but also with the S&P 500. Turning more immediately to 2024, we forecast another year of strong operational and financial performance. We expect our $6.2 billion capital plan to grow oil volumes by 3% and total production on a BOE basis by 7%. At just $45 WTI, our plan breaks even. At $75 WTI and $250 Henry Hub, we expect to generate about $4.8 billion of free cash flow and produce an ROCE of greater than 20%. Based on our target of returning at least 70% of free cash flow, that implies a minimum return to shareholders of $3.4 billion this year. Now, here's Billy to review 2023 operating results and proved reserves. Lloyd Helms : Thanks, Ann. 2023 proved to be another exceptional year of performance, and I would like to thank each of our employees for their accomplishments and execution last year. For the full year, we delivered oil production above the original guidance midpoint set at the beginning of the year, while capital spending was at the midpoint. Overall, we were able to grow our oil volumes by 3% and our total production by 8% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, we achieved a significant milestone, crossing the 1 million barrel of oil equivalent per day level of total production. EOG has been able to nearly double production over the last 10 years through our high return organic growth approach. Last year, our cross-functional teams worked to drive efficiency gains throughout our multi-basin portfolio. For drilling operations, our EOG motor program continues to reduce downtime with our 2023 program yielding about a 15% improvement in footage drilled per rig. For completions, we continue to expand our super zipper operations across our multi-basin portfolio, reduce frac fleet move times, and decrease stage pump times due to increased horsepower for frac fleet. This improved our completed footage per frac fleet by about 7% in 2023. And we expect to continue seeing the benefit of those gains throughout 2024, which Jeff will run through shortly. Our production teams work to optimize production and expenses, reducing our cash operating costs to $10.33 per BOE. In addition, our facility and operating personnel continue to reduce our methane emissions while commissioning our first CCS injection well. Our approved reserve base increased by 260 million barrels of oil equivalent last year, and now totals nearly 4.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent. This represents a 6% increase in reserves year-over-year, and proved reserve replacement of 202%, excluding price-related revisions, with a finding and development cost of just $7.20 per barrel of oil equivalent. Now here's Jeff to discuss operations and the 2024 plan. Jeffrey Leitzell : Thanks, Billy. For our 2024 plan, we forecast a $6.2 billion CapEx program to deliver 3% oil volume growth and 7% total production growth. We expect to see some deflation throughout the year, and our forecasting well cost to be down a low single-digit percentage compared to last year. The primary drivers are a 10% to 15% reduction in tubulars and ancillary service costs. Our plan reflects increased investment in long-term strategic infrastructure in the Delaware Basin and Dorado, which are expected to reduce operating costs and expand margins for the life of these assets. These projects are highlighted on slide seven of our presentation, and Lance will discuss them in greater detail in a moment. I'd like to highlight that our year-over-year direct capital efficiency is improving, which is illustrated in our capital program breakdown on slide six of our earnings presentation. In addition to the operational improvements Billy mentioned, our company-wide average treated lateral length per well is increasing by 10% in 2024. These improved efficiencies and longer laterals have resulted in a decrease in the number of drilling rigs by four, frac fleets by two, and our net wells by 40 compared to last year. The ability to grow our volumes year-over-year for less direct CapEx is a testament to the improved well performance and operational efficiency gains we are realizing across our operating area. When looking at our activity in 2024, EOG remains focused on progressing each one of our plays at a measured pace that allows us to capture and implement valuable learnings while realizing consistent improvement. In our foundational plays, specifically the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford, our teams are executing at a high level, and we expect to maintain consistent activity compared to 2023. For Dorado, we remain excited about this 21 TCF resource potential asset and the role it will play in meeting growing global natural gas demand. Throughout last year, our team made good progress on improving operational efficiencies and recoveries. For 2024, we expect to moderate activity compared to 2023. A balanced approach to our investment in Dorado will allow us to maintain consistent operations to advance and improve the play while continuing to remain flexible as we monitor the natural gas market. In the Utica play, our technical and operations teams continue to make great progress. Our latest three-well Xavier package delivered initial 30-day average production of 3,250 barrel of oil equivalent per day with 55% oil and 75% liquids. The Xavier wells were drilled at 800-foot spacing, which is tighter than the Timberwolf package at 1,000-foot spacing. We are pleased that all of our package wells to date have come online at production levels exceeding results from our initial individual test wells. For 2024, we expect to increase our activity level to one full rig, continue to test well spacing, and delineate our acreage across the play. Our next four-well package, named White Rhino, is located in the southern part of the Utica, and we expect these wells to come online in the first half of the year. In the Powder River Basin, our team has continued to improve well productivity in the Mowry Formation. We have observed double-digit increases in oil and BOE productivity per well due to improved targeting and our consistent package development. Moving into 2024, we expect to moderate activity levels, and along with Mowry development, will begin testing packages in the shallower Niobrara Formation in our primary development area. I would like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication that has positioned the company for another outstanding year. We are excited about executing our 2024 plan. EOG remains focused on running the business for the long-term, generating high returns through disciplined growth, operational execution, and investing in projects that will lower the future cost bases of the company. Now here's Lance to discuss infrastructure. Lance Terveen : Thanks, Jeff. Infrastructure investments have been an essential element of EOG's marketing strategy to maintain transportation flexibility out of a basin, diversification of in-sales markets, and control from wellhead to sales point for flow assurance and to maximize margins. More recently, we have invested in two new strategic infrastructure assets to lower the long-term cost bases of the company and enhance margins. In the Delaware Basin, we are constructing the Janus natural gas processing plant, a 300 million cubic feet per day facility, along with gathering pipelines up to 24 inches in diameter. This new plant and gathering system is expected to provide material savings over the life of our Delaware Basin asset and reliability and flow assurance in the most active oil play in the U.S. We expect Janus will go into service in the first half of next year and deliver cost savings and revenue uplift of about $0.50 per MCF. While we enjoy great relationships with our third-party midstream providers, this new EOG-owned plant adds optionality consistent with our marketing strategy. The Delaware Basin is our largest asset by throughput volumes, and early high utilizations at our Janus plant provides for an anticipated 20% plus rate of return. In our emerging South Texas Dorado play, we're constructing Phase 2 of the Verde 36-inch natural gas pipeline. We have taken a very disciplined approach to build out Verde commensurate with expansion of U.S. Gulf Coast demand. We placed Phase 1, which terminates in Freer, Texas, in service last year. And once Phase 2 is fully in service later this year, the Verde pipeline will extend to Agua Dulce, where we will have a premier position along the Gulf Coast with pipeline connections to reach multiple demand centers, including LNG facilities and additional local and Mexico markets. We continue to see consistent well results in Dorado, and this new strategic investment supports lower future breakevens in a volatile natural gas market. We're extremely pleased with the progress we're making with these strategic infrastructure investments, which we expect will lower the cost basis of the company, provide substantial savings versus other alternatives, and increase operational control. In addition to strategic infrastructure, we continue to be a first mover in marketing our domestic natural gas to diverse indexes. We recently finalized a sale and purchase agreement for 140,000 MMBtu per day of our natural gas index to Brent, and another 40,000 MMBtu per day index to Brent, or a U.S. Gulf Coast gas index, beginning in January of 2027. Adding a Brent-linked agreement with start date certainty further expands EOG's pricing exposure to international natural gas markets and growing LNG demand. EOG is executing on its marketing strategy to diversify our access to customers across multiple end markets for our growing production of reliable and affordable natural gas. Now here's Ezra to wrap up. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Lance. EOG's business has never been better, and our financial position has never been stronger. Our 2023 operational and financial results were not a one-time event. Rather, the results reflect our value proposition at work. Capital discipline, operational execution, leadership, and sustainability, and a unique culture are at the core of our success and will continue to deliver consistent shareholder value, and it continues in 2024. We are investing across our multi-basin portfolio with a focus on optimizing both near and long-term free cash flow generation and delivering high returns, while staying flexible with respect to supply and demand fundamentals of both oil and natural gas. Our disciplined approach to premium oil investment, commitment to organic exploration, and strategic infrastructure investments drive our low breakevens and through-cycle value creation. And you can see this discipline delivering consistent results across our three-year scenario. Our confidence in EOG's ability to compete across sectors, create value for our shareholders and be a part of the long-term energy solution has never been higher. Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Leo Mariani of ROTH MKM. Please go ahead. Leo Mariani : Hi, guys. I wanted to just address the U.S. gas production guidance for 2024. It seems like it's a pretty wide range this year versus the oil number, which is quite a bit tighter. I just wanted to get a sense if there's kind of a concerted effort on EOG's behalf to perhaps alter some of the timing of turn in lines during the course of the year to maybe try to avoid some of these weak months here for gas prices and potentially try to bring volumes on closer to next winter. And just any thoughts on your macro for gas in terms of kind of tying it in terms of how you see gas prices play out here. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Leo. This is Ezra. Thanks for the question. Yeah. What I would say is you can expect out of Dorado similar treatment to what we did last year. I mean, to start with, we already reduced our activity level at Dorado by reducing the rig activity. And then we'll be flexible just like we were last year with completions and when we're bringing those wells on throughout the year with respect to the natural gas market. I think when you're talking about the gas growth and the gas guide for the company in general, you bring up a good point. When we look at U.S. gas growth from Q4 exit rates to the 2024 midpoint guide, you're really seeing about 80 million a day in the domestic gas growth. And then what's a little bit unique to this year is the amount of gas growth we're actually seeing out of Trinidad. That's actually contributing a significant amount of gas growth at the company level from the Q4 exit rates to the midpoint 2024 guide for Trinidad. You're seeing about a 50 million a day growth rate there. So a little bit unique. And as you guys know, we've got a consistent program down in Trinidad. We've been in the middle of a drilling campaign for this year, and we're also still under construction on a platform that we plan on placing at the end of this year.  And the unique thing about Trinidad, of course, is that their current supply and demand fundamentals on gas are, quite frankly, almost opposite of what we're seeing domestically here in the U.S. That's a country which, up until the last decade, used to have a very robust supply of natural gas. And in the last decade or so, that's been decreasing. So they find themselves really undersupplied on the natural gas side for their domestic needs. And, of course, we sell all of our gas currently into the domestic market at pricing that's slightly advantaged and makes those projects down there very competitive with the rest of our domestic portfolio. Outside of that, the U.S. gas growth is really -- the majority of that 80 million a day is really associated gas that's coming off of our liquids rich and oil plays. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just jump in gears over to the PRB. Obviously, that's an important play that you guys have emphasized over the last couple years. I do see that there is some additional Utica activity this year, but it looks like you're pulling back a little bit in the PRB, which maybe was a little bit kind of surprising to me. I think you've got 10 fewer wells in terms of completions this year versus last. I assume that you're still trying to progress the science and the learnings on the play. So maybe you can just add a little color as to why some of the months pull back here in '24. Jeffrey Leitzell : Yeah, Leo. This is Jeff. And yeah, great point. So, we had a lot of great success as we talked about in our opening comments with our Mowry program there. We're seeing increases in overall productivity in that target by about 10% year-over-year, both on oil and BOE. And really what it has to do with is just us getting the package development on our corridor and really understanding how to offset those parent packages with additional activity. So with that, though, we've also been able to really accumulate data with drilling all those Mowry wells up through that overlying Niobrara. So we're going to shift gears here a little bit there since we've been able to refine our geologic models. And we're going to go ahead and start testing some of the package development in that shallower Niobrara formation right along our primary infrastructure corridor. So really when you look at our program, it's just a slight step back on the Mowry and a little bit more focused now to kind of really figure out the geologic models in the Niobrara and get some package production performance on. So activity will be equally split really kind of between the Mowry and the Niobrara formations. So it's very similar to what we did in the Delaware Basin. Really we developed from the bottom up and it's a similar codevelopment strategy really just to maximize the value of the asset. Operator : The next question comes from Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Neal Dingmann : Morning. Thanks for the time guys. My first question is on the Utica oil play. I'm just wondering, are you continuing to add acreage? It sounds like maybe you've recently added some and then secondly on that play, how far west in that black oil window do you all have confidence these days? Lloyd Helms : Yeah, Neal. This is Billy Helms. We have continued to look for opportunities to pick up acreage where we see it. Just a reminder overall our acreage acquisition cost is probably around $600 an acre. So very low cost of entry, especially when you consider it compared to a lot of other opportunities to deploy capital. So we're very pleased with our organic approach there and we'll continue that trend and try to pick up acreage that's accretive to our position. And then as far as how far west are we confident? We're continuing to test out the play. Just a reminder, if you look on the slide in our investor deck, I think slide 17, it illustrates how that play extends 140 miles north to south. So far we've got a handful of wells where we have production data on. We'll grow that this year to about add another 20-plus or minus wells. So we're very pleased with the activity we've seen, the results we've seen. We still have a lot of testing to do across that 140 mile span. We are seeing some data that tells us we can go a little bit further west, but we have yet to prove that out. So we'll give you those results as we start seeing the performance of some wells in the future. But we're still remain extremely excited about the potential of that play. Neal Dingmann : Yeah, I look forward to what you all got going there. And then secondly, just on OFS materials, specifically, in the past you guys have done a great job using that strong balance sheet to optimize the stockpile of pipe and other materials. And I'm just wondering, can you speak to if you're currently building any inventory levels or if you believe future prices could fall? So you're just -- I guess, running more in real time. Jeffrey Leitzell : Yeah, Neal. This is Jeff. So yeah, we always tend to carry somewhere between a six-month to a 12-year inventory. And it really does give us an advantage to kind of strike on opportunistic purchases. And I think that's one of the things, if you look at this year, really the primary drivers that we're seeing, as far as deflation is really going to be those tubular costs, which we're expecting to be down kind of 10% to 15%. That's really a credit to our procurement team to be able to really find really opportunistic times to be able to buy the pipe and go ahead and add that to our inventory. So we're able to see that price drop throughout this year. And then the other thing I'd say is really the other drop we're seeing is in ancillary services really supporting kind of drilling and completions. We see kind of a 10% to 15% drop in those support services such as coal tubing, wire line, cement and other such. So seeing some movement there on the deflationary front. We think from an overall tubular standpoint, we're in great position for 2024. Operator : The next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hope everyone's doing well after a busy earnings season. Ezra, I always appreciate, we always appreciate the free cash flow visibility that you guys try and give us after last quarter in particular. I'm looking at slide five, however, and you've got about 7% growth this year. Presumably there is growth in future years through that '26 plan. My question is, if I look at the cumulative free cash flow and just do the simple math, it looks like the free cash flow is flatlining over that period despite the growth. So I wonder if you could give us some color on the CapEx that goes along with that. And how at the end of the period your sustaining capital would reset given the larger volume you would have at that time. Ezra Yacob : Yeah. Doug, thanks for the question. This is Ezra. Yeah. The cumulative free cash flow over the three-year period in the three-year scenario here that you highlighted on slide five, it's roughly 10% higher than the previous three years here that we have. So you see expanding margins in that three-year scenario. And unfortunately what we haven't given you is some of those specific details that you're really getting into. What we have talked about, and we talked about this in November, and then you and I talked about it again in your conference there in November, is our maintenance capital number currently is midpoint of 4.5 under a variety of different scenarios for a multi-basin organic growth company like ourselves, that maintenance capital will kind of range from 4.2 to 4.8. And that depends on, again, are we trying to keep oil flat, equivalents flat. Are we really just focused on maintaining production? Or are we actually investing in additional exploration and infrastructure and things of that nature? When you look and roll that into the three-year scenario, since we are growing volumes, you're right, that maintenance capital should be trending up a little bit. That's also going to be offset in the real world by some of the deflationary factors that we have moving towards us throughout this three-year plan. What I would say is that we don't see that the free cash flow is flatlining. In fact, what we see is a 6% cash flow and free cash flow per share compound annual growth rate across that three-year scenario. Doug Leggate : That's helpful. We'll take another look at it in the buybacks. We'll certainly help that, I hope. My follow-up is a little bit random, perhaps. But clearly it seems with the Utica and Dorado, you can't kind of help yourself, but grow gas with one rig in the Dorado, given how strong the volumes are, obviously. But it seems that the mix is kind of shifting a little bit over time. I think we also talked about that in November. My question is, what can we expect from the next steps of the organic strategy from EOG? If I could be a little specific, there's a fair amount of speculation that you guys are looking hard again at Canada and the -- should we think that organic growth could move in that direction? I'll leave it there. Thank you. Ezra Yacob : Yeah. Doug, to quote you, that is a bit of a random question. We're always organically exploring for things. With regards to the Canadian assets, we were up there a number of years ago and we strategically exited that asset. At the real heart of your question, the way to think about the strategy for us is we've captured a tremendous resource down here in South Texas in the Dorado natural gas play. What we're building is a low-cost gas business that really sits alongside our core oil investment. And so when we think about capital allocation, it's not necessarily allocating more capital to gas rather than oil. It's really looking at these assets in place independently and what's the best thing for the company to continue to drive down our breakevens, continue to build value for the shareholders. With regards to the Utica and some of the other emerging assets, in a lot of ways our premium and double premium return threshold makes us a little bit ambivalent or agnostic to the actual hydrocarbon type that we're producing because again, these things are really a return-based question. When you layer in the macro environment, we do need to have consideration on that. Going forward with the gas market, this year definitely does look a little bit soft. We touched on that just a little with Leo's question at the top of the Q&A. But we still do remain constructive on the U.S. domestic gas market, say, 12 months and further out from here as the LNG demand continues to come on. And with some of the announcements we've made today, you can see that we plan on being a part of that solution going forward. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Hanold of RBC. Please go ahead. Scott Hanold : Thanks. Hey, Ezra, EOG shares have laid some of its peers on both multiple bases and just in aggregate performance here. I can remember in the past when you all had commanded a pretty good multiple premium to everyone else. I'm just curious, you've shown the willingness and appetite to step in to buyback strategically over the last year. As you look at 2024 where your stock's trading right now and in your strong balance sheet, is there a willingness to get more aggressive and use some of that balance sheet strength to underpin the intrinsic value seen in EOG? Ezra Yacob : Scott, that's a good question. I think when we think about buybacks, again, we think about what's the best way to create long-term shareholder value. That's it. You're right. We've seen our multiple compressed. We've seen really multiples compressed across all of industry. I think you don't have to look any further than the weighting of energy in the S&P 500 at approximately 5%, maybe a little bit under that, with close to 10% on forecasted earnings. So I do think we sit currently in what we'd say is a dislocated environment. And from that regard, I think as we move forward and generate a significant amount of free cash flow this year with our minimum commitment to shareholders to return 70% of that free cash flow to our shareholders, you could anticipate that being more in the form of buybacks right now. Now, when we look back at what we have done historically on buybacks, in 2023, we were very active in the first half of the year, during some real dramatic dislocations, I would say, regional banking crisis and the debt ceiling conversations and things like that. Now, we did, as an example, take a step back on buybacks in Q3 as oil price rose from $69 to $93 throughout that quarter. And obviously, there was some share price appreciation as well. And then in the fourth quarter with volatility entering the sector, again, the continued multiple compression across industry and across EOG, we obviously stepped back into it. When we think about it, we think about the strength of the company as we continue to improve. I think you can see with our three-year scenario, we continue to expand the free cash flow potential of the company. We continue to do that while generating high returns. I think really -- like I said, currently, we would consider ourselves in a dislocated environment. Scott Hanold : Okay. I appreciate the color. And then if I can pivot to the three-year outlook and kind of parlay the premium activity into that. You all provided that chart on the Permian where you show the mix of wells and an increasing overall cumulative production, but just a touch lower on oil. I know you guys do a lot of codevelopment, but can you talk about the trend investors should expect on how that mix shifts going forward and within that three-year outlook? A - Jeffrey Leitzell Yeah, Scott. This is Jeff and thanks for the question. Yeah. We are going to be completing a few more Wolfcamp M wells in our 2025 program, but it's just part of our plan and our normal cadence of development as we move section to section and we move up in section and develop each one of the intervals. The one thing about the M is you need to identify whether or not it has a good barrier between it and the upper Wolfcamp. If there is, you can go ahead and develop that target independently, but in many of our areas that we are going to be developing the Wolfcamp this year, it's really optimal to codevelop those two targets together. And this is just strategic really to minimize any kind of depletion in these sections and maximize the value of each one of those targets. As a reminder, the Wolfcamp M does have more associated gas, but it's also a very, very prolific oil producer. It's got premium returns and the wells pay out in about eight months. So our goal in the Permian or any kind of stacked pay basins is always going to be to continue to execute a codevelopment strategy and really just focus on maximizing returns and NPV. And I'm sorry, I think I said 2025, I meant 2024 program. Operator : The next question comes from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Neil Mehta : Yeah. Thanks, Ezra and team. First question on just going back to the macro, I think we've been surprised by the supply of natural gas from the U.S. over the course of the last six months. And one of the areas has been associated Permian supply. And so, Ezra, I love your perspective on how you see that evolving, especially as some of the wells mature, but maybe as U.S. production declines on the other side of it. And how that all ties into the way you're thinking about mid-cycle views on gas? Ezra Yacob : Yeah. Thanks, Neil. That's a good point. I think you will continue to see -- so far our models is here for U.S. growth might start there since we're going to be talking about associated gas is really where your question is. It's roughly around a 500,000 barrel total liquids. So roughly say 300,000 barrels more along the crude oil. And obviously, the significant amount of that is going to be coming out of the Permian, which in general, that basin is a little bit higher GOR than some of the historical plays like the Eagle Ford and the Bakken that we've had. And I think you'll continue to see -- our model would suggest you'll continue to see an increase in the associated gas and more than likely a bit more of a differential struggles there with Waha. We take that into consideration when we're thinking about the development of Dorado. Like I said, you can't forecast a supply and demand or forecast future gas, mid-cycle gas prices without having a recognition of what's happening on the oil side. It's one of the things that makes forecasting gas so difficult. So the ultimate thing, the way that we manage our business and we're trying to grow this gas asset in concert with our oil plays is to really think about being the absolute low-cost producer. And that's one reason you haven't seen us ramp up aggressively in the Dorado asset. It's one reason you've seen us last year and this year moderate activity, because we've captured a significant resource. We think geographically it's located a place that gives us significant advantage. We've invested in some additional infrastructure, including the Dorado pipeline that's named Verde, that's going to give us a margin expansion over the life of that asset. And that's really the way that we're focusing on developing a pure gas asset is really in concert with the growing future North American demand, which is dominantly driven from the LNG there along the Gulf Coast. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Ezra. The follow-up is you have a different strategy than many of your peers. We've seen so much consolidation in the conventional space in the last year, and you've got a much more organic approach. And I guess I wanted to give you an opportunity to talk to the investor base about why you think that is the right strategy and what are the pluses and minuses that come with that strategy. Ezra Yacob : Yeah. Well, as we've talked about before, we're focused on creating shareholder value through the cycles. And the consistent way that we've been able to generate that value is through organic exploration, a focus on low-cost operations and a commitment to capital discipline. We have a high level of confidence in our existing portfolio, and it's aimed at improving the financial performance of the company. And again, I think you can see that with expanded margins and expanded free cash flow in that three-year scenario we provided. It's underpinned with a 10 billion barrel of equivalent premium resource. And we have meaningful upside with that resource, not only through future conversions, future exploration, but also just through the Utica resource that we've already captured and we've begun discussing. When you think about our organic exploration effort, our first mover advantage on the three emerging assets, the Dorado North Powder -- I'm sorry, Powder River Basin and the Utica, those three individual assets have the ability to represent, the equivalence of a smaller midsize E&P company, quite frankly. Dorado with 160,000 acres and approximately 20 TCF captured, the Powder River Basin with multiple targets across 380,000 acres, and the Utica asset with over 400,000 acres. So we continue to focus on improving the inventory, not just expanding it. Unproven resources, we do think trade at a wider discount these days than what proven resources do. And so we're focused on continuing to prove up and drive down the cost of these assets and bring them forward to create that value for our shareholders. Operator : The next question comes from Brad Brackett of Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Brad Brackett : Good morning. And thinking about the Utica, I look at the 90-day cubes. You can put a reasonable price against those volumes and compare it to a reasonable well cost, and it looks quite impressive. And maybe in the old era, that would lead to a flag dropping and a huge ramp in activity in volumes. Is there something that's governing the pace at which you develop the Utica? And maybe it's corporate strategy, or maybe it's gas takeaway, or maybe it's just getting costs of wells down. And will we ever see the sort of off to the races ramp that we saw in the old days in emerging shale plays? Lloyd Helms : Yeah, Bob. This is Billy. Yeah, thanks for the recognition there for the Utica. We're very excited about that play, and the performance of the wells that we've tested across the play seem to continue to meet or beat our type curve. So we're very pleased with that. We haven't given you a lot of details on the cost yet, but we continue to drive down our cost through increased efficiency gains. And early in any play, you do a lot of testing and a lot of science gathering data. And we expect to see that cost come down. And we haven't really given you a lot of color yet on the EUR of those wells yet either, because we don't have but just a handful of wells with limited production data. And we want to gather more time before we can give you some answers. But I guess from all that, we still feel very confident that our previous estimates of being in that $5 finding cost range look very strong. And we're still committed to that. And on top of that, as far as the ramp up and how we expect to see that continuing, as we gather more data, we get more confidence and we can be more diligent about how we want to choose to ramp to make the most cost-efficient way we can develop that asset. So we simply don't need to ramp up any single asset very aggressively. And that's why you don't see us -- I mean, that's the advantage of being in a multi-basin portfolio is you're not required to grow or meet certain targets out of one asset. We have the flexibility that provides us to grow gradually in pace with our learnings so we don't outrun our learning curve. And we can be the most efficient operator in any of those basins. Brad Brackett : And maybe there's never a huge incentive from your shareholder base that goes and tells you, hey, go build some gas pipe take-away, ramp this thing to 100,000 barrels a day. So we might never see sort of those huge levels of growth from the previous era. Lloyd Helms : Yeah. I think you wouldn't see the same levels of growth you saw in the past. I think our strategy would be to grow at a pace that's commensurate with our understanding of the resource, how to best develop it over the long term for our shareholders, and bring that value forward the best. We don't want to destroy value either by running too fast. So that's the balance here is we want to develop at a pace that is commensurate with our understanding of each asset. Operator : The next question comes from Roger Reed of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Roger Reed : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I'd like to come back a little bit more on the well efficiencies, kind of the well costs as you look at '24 versus '23,the longer lateral links. Just where should we think about that occurring? You just mentioned multi-basin, right? So is the lateral improvement or increase coming mostly out of the Delaware? Is it spread across all the operations? And what are, either opportunities or limitations on further expansion of the lateral links? Jeffrey Leitzell : Yeah, Roger, this is Jeff. Thanks for the question. So the lateral links have been a pretty big driver in our efficiency gains. We've had an opportunity to test longer laterals over the last few years pretty much throughout our multi-basin portfolio, and all of them with good success. So based on -- basically drilling longer where it's applicable based on our acreage footprint. And that's one of the limiting factors that we run into. In San Antonio, we've talked about, the years, our 15 years of drilling there, we've moved from the east, which has a little bit more robust geology out to the west, which has a little lesser geology. But we've been able to really optimize the economics there by utilizing longer laterals and really pushing our completion techniques to improve operational and capital efficiencies. And we're continuing to do that this year. So we're seeing some extension there in the Eagle Ford. In the Utica, we've talked about, we've been doing delineation up and down the 140-mile oily fairway there. And now we're starting to move into spacing packages and then just package development. So the majority of those wells are going to be three miles moving forward. So that's an increase in the overall lateral length of the company there. And then in Midland, we've been testing three-mile laterals for the last couple of years, but not really in high volume. Last year we drilled about four or five of them. And we've seen really good success. And we've been able to find the correct blocks and places that works with our acreage. We're going to increase that to about over 53-mile laterals there in Midland. So when you kind of roll it all up across the company, the overall lateral length will be up about 10% versus 2023 program. And we talked about, with those efficiency gains from the lateral length and just what we're seeing from some of the stuff Billy talked on the drilling and completion side, we're going to require that four less rigs and two less frac fleets and then also four less net wells. But all while doing that, we're still going to be completing a similar amount of total lateral length as we did with our 2023 program. So the way I'd look at it is we're just riding a lot of momentum with our efficiencies and our lateral lengths coming out of 2023. We'll just continue to look to build on that in 2024. Roger Reed : Thanks. There was a lot in that question, so I'll turn it back there. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Portillo of TPH. Please go ahead. Matthew Portillo : Good morning, all. Just a follow-up question on the marketing side. In the Permian specifically, you highlight the ability to build out the gas processing plant, which lowers your cost structure. I was curious how you see the fairway for long-haul gas takeaway out of the Permian over the next few years. I know Matterhorn will start to clear the basin towards the end of 2024, but it does feel like it remains pretty tight in 2025 and 2026 plus. So just curious what role EOG might play in long-haul takeaway out of the Permian as it relates to potentially taking on some incremental capacity to make sure that gas is able to flow. Lance Terveen : Yeah, Matthew, good morning. This is Lance. Maybe I'll start. When you think about just kind of the macro, you're right. You have Matterhorn that's coming on, and you've had other pipes that have been expanded with like horsepower, right? So we kind of see going in -- you're going to see the basis going to continue to kind of be wide moving this year and probably potentially into next year. But what I would want to really highlight is just we've continued to be a leader as we think about like our transportation portfolio. And we have been a part of many of those pipes. So we were actually very early on pushing on those pipes to make sure that we have a pretty significant transportation portfolio for not only the gas, but then also the crude oil. But from a natural gas standpoint and then the long-haul pipes from an EOG standpoint, we're very well positioned with over a BCF a day of residue takeaway that hits into what we think are some great markets along the Gulf Coast. Matthew Portillo : Great. And then maybe as a follow-up question. I just wanted to come back to the Powder, highlighting obviously the opportunity set to delineate the Niobrara, which I think carries an oilier horizon to it. I'm just curious, the learnings you've had so far in terms of the drilling environment. I know trying to drive down the well cost has been a big part of improving the economics as well as the productivity uplift you all talked about. And is this just a pause in the overall program? Or should we be thinking about this as potentially a pull of capital permanently towards the Utica going forward? Jeffrey Leitzell : Yeah, Matt. This is Jeff. No, I wouldn't look at it as a pause necessarily in the program. I think it's just a shift. We've gathered really good data. We've had great results in that Mowry target. We've had great efficiency gains and cost improvement. And our plan always was once we were able to gather some really robust data sets on the overlying to go ahead and step into the Niobrara a little bit, which, with that we'll back off with our packages in the Mowry to do so. So, Niobrara as far as from -- in the Mowry from a drilling aspect, they're a little bit different. The Niobrara is going to be a little bit easier drilling, I would say, compared to the Mowry because the Mowry is deeper. And then also in there you have some [indiscernible] you can get caught into and have some issues. The Niobrara, on the other hand is -- there's clinaforms [ph] and really we've mapped those clinaforms out well to find out what the better producers are. So we really want to be strategic as we mark across our acreage to make sure we're staying in those right clinaforms. And I think that really has to do with the discipline pace that we're looking at there in the Powder. Operator : The next question comes from John Freeman of Raymond James. Please go ahead. John Freeman : Thanks a lot. Just a follow up on what Scott asked earlier regarding sort of the development in the Delaware Basin. And it's obviously clear you all are taking a long-term strategy the way that that's developed with the codevelopment strategy with multiple targets as opposed to just sort of cherry picking, just drilling the oiliest zones because gas is weaker. It does look like those targeted intervals, Wolfcamp oil and the combo, it has moved around a lot kind of each year, not to get too far ahead, but since you did give the three-year outlook. Would it be safe to assume that if you were thinking out '25, that that sort of shifts a little bit back more towards the oilier zone, just as a nature of the way that you're codeveloping the package? Ezra Yacob : Yeah. John, great question. And yeah, you pretty much hit it on the head. It really just flexes as we move kind of across our acreage into different sections and as the geology changes. So you will see that. If you look at the last four years, you really do see that flex back and forth because we're moving section to section and with our codevelopment strategies strategically codeveloping up from the bottom up to the top of it. So yeah, it will flex kind of through the next handful of years that you see in that three-year scenario. John Freeman : Great. And then just my follow-up, when we look at the infrastructure projects, obviously this year they stepped up with what you're doing at Dorado and Delaware. When we think about something like the Utica combo, is it going to continue to get more and more scale and grow? Should we assume that that kind of infrastructure bucket within the total CapEx, that sort of stays at kind of the level it was this year as a percentage of the budget? Does that potentially go higher when you're looking at kind of that three-year outlook and having these kind of emerging plays like you do? Lloyd Helms : Yeah, John. This is Billy. Let me answer that in a couple of different ways. The infrastructure span, just to address that real up front here. Those are discrete projects that offer long-term support to plays that are going to be developed over multiple decades. So that's a very specific direction for those infrastructure projects that continue to lower our cost in the plays for the company going forward and expand margins for a long, long period of time. For the Utica, there is adequate processing capacity up there, so we're not seeing those kind of projects as an opportunity for the company. I think we're going to be looking at largely gathering process or gathering lines in that area as we develop each play out. Typical of any other normal play, we don't see the need at this point to develop out the large strategic infrastructure in that area. And so I would expect to see over time the infrastructure will stay in that 15% to 20% of our normal capital budget going forward when you take out these two discrete projects. Operator : The next question comes from Arun Jayaram of JP Morgan Securities. Please go ahead. Arun Jayaram : Yeah. Good morning. My first question is regarding your marketing agreement with Chenier to sell some volumes on a JKM link basis tied to Corpus Christi Stage 3. A question for you is on their conference call, they mentioned that the project is undergoing perhaps an accelerated timeline with first LNG possible by the end of this year and for some meaningful full production at this project in 2025. So I was wondering if you could give us some thoughts -- would the marketing agreement kick in earlier coincident with an earlier receipt of first gas? Lance Terveen : Arun, this is Lance. I'm not going to comment on the confidential nature of the agreement, but what I can tell you is we're very excited and we've heard the same comments in terms of effectively probably taking a little bit of feed gas to start some of their operations. And what I want to really point you to is we saw that early, right? I mean, getting that agreement put in place. But I'd say more importantly, right, as you heard Ezra talk about and Billy too on the strategic infrastructure, having that pipeline connectivity, we're going to have a direct connection to Chenier and to that facility. So we're actually very excited and want to be very helpful from that startup of that facility just because that's a major increase of demand that we're going to see that's going to help here within the U.S. as we think about LNG demand. So I really want to point more to that than just we're positioned is what I'll tell you, Arun, we're very well positioned that we can meet that. And so if there's an early startup, great. If not, we're going to be positioned there with our pipeline at the second half of this year to be able to commence deliveries. Arun Jayaram : Okay. Just to clarify, it sounds like if first gas is earlier, you would be able to market your volumes earlier. Is that fair, Lance? Lance Terveen : We would be able to sell into our agreement. That's right. Arun Jayaram : Okay, great. My follow-up is several or a few of your E&P peers have claimed an R&D tax credit, maybe associated with exploration-type activities. I was wondering, just given EOG's historically spent money on exploration, do you qualify for that tax credit? And just give us some thoughts on what it takes and maybe the magnitude if you do qualify. Ann Janssen : We took it -- this is Ann. We took an R&D credit several years ago. Can't remember the year off the top of my head. But we're not planning on taking anything going forward. We don't have the opportunity to take anything forward. And we went and researched again back several years ago on the R&D and took what was available to us. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Yacob for any closing remarks. End of Q&A: Ezra Yacob : Thank you. We appreciate everyone's time today. And we want to thank our shareholders for their support, and special thanks to our employees for delivering another exceptional quarter. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",

I would like to turn the call over to the Investor Relations Vice President of EOG Resources, Mr. Pearce Hammond. Please go ahead, sir. Pearce Hammond : Good morning. And thank you for joining us for the EOG Resources First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. An updated investor presentation has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website and we will reference certain slides during today's discussion. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning later today. As a reminder, this conference call includes forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings.  This conference call may also contain certain historical and forward-looking non-GAAP measures definitions and reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures and related discussion can be found on the Investor Relations section of EOG's website. In addition, some of the reserve estimates on this conference call may include estimated potential reserves as well as estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines.  Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, President; Jeff Leitzell, Chief Operating Officer; Ann Janssen, Chief Financial Officer; Keith Trasko, Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production; and Lance Terveen, Senior Vice President, Marketing. Here's Ezra. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Pearce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. EOG is off to a great start in 2024, both delivering value directly to our shareholders and investing in future value creation. Primary drivers of that value are EOG's commitment to capital discipline operational excellence and leading sustainability efforts, all underpinned by our unique culture. Strong first quarter execution from every operating team across our multi-basin portfolio has positioned the company to deliver exceptional returns. Production and total per unit cash operating costs beat targets, driving strong financial performance during the quarter. We earned $1.6 billion of adjusted net income and generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow. We paid out more than 100% of that free cash flow through our peer-leading regular dividend and $750 million of share repurchases.  EOG's operational execution continues to translate into strong returns and cash flow generation. Our robust cash return to shareholders continues to demonstrate our confidence in the outlook and value of our business.  Quarter after quarter, we have delivered outstanding operational performance in our core assets while also driving forward progress in our emerging plays. We have built one of the deepest, highest return and most diverse multi-basin portfolios of inventory in the industry.  The most recent addition to our portfolio is the Utica combo play, a textbook example of our differentiated approach. Capturing highly productive rock through our organic exploration and leasing efforts is the primary way of expanding our premium inventory with a low cost of entry to drive healthy full cycle returns. Adding reserves at lower finding and development costs drive down DD&A and lowers the overall cost basis of the company. The result is continuous improvement to EOG's company-wide capital efficiency.  Our track record of successful exploration, strong operational execution and Applied Technology has positioned the company to create shareholder value through industry cycles.  The oil macro environment remains dynamic, but is overall constructive, and we anticipate that certain drivers will limit oil prices to a relatively narrow band this year. In the first quarter, global demand performed as expected and is on trend to increase throughout the year, led by a strong U.S. economy.  And while U.S. production surprised to the upside in 2023, several developments have altered the U.S. supply outlook this year. Rig counts have remained flat over the past 8, 9 months, and oil drilled but uncompleted or DUC inventory has been drawn down. Current activity levels combined with M&A in the public and private sectors should lead to more moderated U.S. growth this year.  Globally, spare capacity has kept inventory levels around the 5-year average to start the year and we forecast these barrels returning to the market throughout the second half of the year and aligned with growing demand. Overall, the result is a strong operating environment for a low-cost and returns-focused producers such as EOG.  And while we expect the natural gas market to remain soft through the end of this quarter, much like last year, we expect it to strengthen through the second half of the year and are managing our Dorado program to align with demand. Longer term, we expect an additional 10 to 12 Bcf a day of demand for LNG feed gas and another 10 to 12 Bcf per day of demand from several areas, including overall electrification, exports to Mexico, coal power plant retirements and other industrial demand growth. So the outlook for North American natural gas by the end of this decade is bullish, both for the industry and in particular, for our Dorado dry gas play which has advantaged access to the Gulf Coast and pipeline infrastructure.  We look forward to participating in the emerging LNG demand through our diverse sales agreements to grow from 140,000 MMBtu per day today to 900,000 MMBtu per day over the next 3 years. Through EOG's differentiated approach to organic exploration, the utilization of technology to improve operational efficiencies, vertical integration of certain parts of the supply chain and our diverse marketing strategy, EOG remains focused on being among the highest return lowest cost and lowest emissions producers, offering sustainable value creation through the cycles.  Ann is up next to provide an update on our forecast and 3-year scenario. Here's Ann. Ann Janssen : Thanks, Ezra. Given the recent strength in commodity prices, we have updated our 2024 forecast to reflect $80 oil and $2.50 natural gas for the remainder of the year and now expect to generate $5.6 billion of free cash flow for the full year.  Considering both share repurchases executed during the first quarter and our annualized regular dividend we have already committed to return about $2.9 billion this year, which represents more than 50% of that free cash flow, so we are well on our way to return a minimum of 70%. And while cash return exceeded free cash flow during the first quarter, we continue to view our return commitment on an annual basis. During the first quarter, we repurchased 6.4 million shares for $750 million, averaging about $118 per share. Since we began using our buyback authorization at the start of last year, we have bought back more than 15 million shares or nearly 3% of shares outstanding for an average price of about $115 per share. To date, that totals about $1.7 billion worth of shares. We will continue to monitor the market for opportunities to step in and repurchase shares throughout the year.  Last quarter, we provided a 3-year scenario to illustrate EOG's expanded capacity to generate free cash flow and earn a strong double-digit return on capital employed to create future shareholder value. This quarter, we provided an additional price scenario to illustrate our expanded free cash flow potential over the next 3 years by assuming similar commodity prices as the past 3 years. From 2021 through 2023, oil averaged $80 and natural gas averaged $4.25. Over that 3-year time frame, we generated $18 billion of free cash flow. Applying those same commodity prices to our forecast for the next 3 years, we would expect to generate $21 billion of free cash flow. That's 17% more cumulative free cash flow than the prior 3 years at the same price deck. Robust cash returned to shareholders, supported by substantial free cash flow stems from EOG's strong operational execution by focusing on well performance, sustainable cost reductions and maximizing full cycle returns through organic exploration and disciplined growth EOG has driven a step change in our financial performance and capacity to create significant value for our shareholders.  Now here's Jeff to review operating results. Jeffrey Leitzell : Thanks, Anne. I'd like to first thank all the employees for a great start to the year with safe and efficient operational execution. Our first quarter volumes and total per unit cash operating costs beat targets while capital was in line. For the year, our capital forecast remains $6.2 billion and delivers 3% oil volume growth and 6% total production growth. We continue to expect that capital this year will be slightly more weighted in the first half, driven by the timing of our investments in the 2 infrastructure projects that we provided details on last quarter. These projects include the Janus gas processing plant in the Delaware Basin and the Verde pipeline that will serve our South Texas Dorado play, both highlighted on Slide 10 of our investor presentation.  By the end of the second quarter, we expect to be on pace to have spent about 56% of our $6.2 billion capital plan. While our oil production and capital plan for the full year remains unchanged, we are actively managing activity in our Dorado asset, which is reflected in our second quarter natural gas production guidance published yesterday. As discussed last quarter, we moderated activity in Dorado this year in response to a weaker natural gas market and are now leveraging additional flexibility to delay well completions and manage volumes through the summer. However, we will continue to pursue a balanced development approach with this asset, which includes operating a full rig program throughout the year. This will help maintain operational momentum, capture corresponding efficiencies and continue to advance and improve the play while we continue to monitor the natural gas market.  We remain constructive on the long-term gas outlook for the U.S., supported by LNG, power generation demand and the growing petrochemical complex on the Gulf Coast. We are especially pleased with Dorado's place in the market as one of the lowest cost supplies of natural gas in the U.S. with an advantaged location and emissions profile.  With regards to service cost market, bids for standard spot services have been trending lower, which is consistent with our expectations of seeing some deflation this year. For high-spec rigs and frac fleets, we are still observing stable pricing. However, their availability is improving, especially in markets with less activity.  As a reminder, we have secured 50% to 60% of our service cost in 2024, primarily with our high-spec high-demand services to ensure consistent performance throughout our program. By securing these resources, we're able to focus on sustainable efficiency improvements to progress each one of our plays at a measured pace.  EOG's operating performance and capital efficiency continues to improve as our cross-functional teams work to drive efficiency gains throughout our multi-basin portfolio. A significant driver of efficiencies this year is longer laterals, which we expect will increase by 10% on average company-wide. The charge is being led in our foundational plays, the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford, Our operating teams in both plays have achieved consistent execution and success drilling and completing longer laterals leading to increased efficiencies, lower per foot well cost and improved well economics.  In the Delaware Basin, we drilled 4 3-mile laterals in 2023 and have plans to drill more than 50 in 2024. In the Eagle Ford, our 24 plan includes increasing the average lateral length by about 20% to continue to unlock new potential across our 535,000 net acre footprint.  Moving to the Powder River Basin. Our technical teams continue to make good strides with our balanced development approach between the Mowry and the Niobrara formations. In the Niobrara, we have recently transitioned into package development by applying the learnings we captured while drilling the deeper mile reformation first.  In our first 3 Niobrara development packages this year, we've been able to increase our drilling footage per day by 25% compared to 2023 averages, while maintaining over 95% in zone targeting. This can be attributed to our refined geologic models and a better understanding of the stratigraphic variation across the play.  With these continued efficiency gains across our diverse portfolio plays along with stable service costs, our expectations for full year well cost decrease is a low single-digit percentage. After a strong first quarter, EOG is well positioned to execute on its full year plan. Our technical teams continue to drive innovation with a focus on improved recovery, lowering costs and being a leader in sustainability.  Now here's Keith to provide more color on the Utica. Keith Trasko : Thanks, Jeff. We're very happy with the results of our first 3 packages of development wells in the Utica combo play. We now have over 6 months of production data from the first 2, the Timberwolf and Xavier, which continue to outperform our expectations. Daily production rates per well have averaged more than 1,000 barrels of oil NGLs and 4 million cubic feet of gas over the first 6 months. On average, these 7 wells have produced more than 200,000 barrels of oil per well since being brought online in the second half of 2023. We recently brought on our third package, the White Rhino.  This is our first development package in the southern portion of our acreage. The 4 White Rhino wells drilled at 1,000-foot spacing have been meeting our expectations during their first few weeks of production. Initial production also indicates a slightly higher liquids mix than our Timberwolf and Xavier wells drilled in the north and central parts of the play.  While our Northern and Central acreage benefits from a thicker Utica, the southern area has better mechanical properties. The southern area also benefits from significant economic uplift associated with the mineral rights we secured across 135,000 net acres. The White Rhino wells add to our growing collection of data points, which includes 18 legacy wells, 4 delineation wells and now 3 development packages, which adds another 11 wells. While we expect to see performance vary across our 435,000 net acre position, well results over the past 2 years in multiple areas confirm high liquids premium productivity through the 140-mile north-south trend of the Utica's volatile oil window.  On a per foot basis, the cumulative production in the Utica combo play compares favorably with some of the best areas of the Permian Basin with respect to both oil and total equivalents. Our large contiguous acreage position in the Utica lends itself to developing a long-life, repeatable, low-cost play competitive with the premier unconventional plays across North America. Our operating team continues to leverage consistent activity to increase efficiencies and drive down well costs. We recently drilled a 3.7 mile lateral on our stable pattern in the South, which is an EOG wide record lateral length. This well is scheduled to come online later this year, and we are excited to continue driving similar efficiencies as we increase our activity across this asset.  For 2024, we are on target to drill and complete 20 net wells in the Utica across our northern, central and southern acreage, which supports a full rig program and enables significant well cost reductions.  Now here's Ezra to wrap up. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Keith. I would like to note the following important takeaways : First, our differentiated business model focused on exploration and innovation has built one of the deepest highest return and most diverse multi-basin portfolios of inventory in the industry. The Utica, our most recent exploration success will be competitive with the premier unconventional plays across North America; Second, consistent execution in our core Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford assets delivers outstanding operational performance quarter after quarter, while investment in our emerging plays contributes to EOG's financial performance today and lays the groundwork for years of future high-return investment; Third, our robust cash return to shareholders continues to demonstrate our confidence in the outlook and value of our business; Finally, one of EOG's best champions of utilizing innovation to constantly improve the company as our friend and colleague, Billy Helms. Billy recently announced that he will retire at the end of this month.  In Billy's 40-year career with EOG, he demonstrated a distinctive ability to encourage new ideas from our employees across multiple disciplines, innovative ideas to utilize infield technology, information technology and new processes to drill better wells for lower cost, more safely and with lower emissions. He then helped shepherd the very best of those ideas through to execution across the company. Even though well learned, the retirement of a friend and colleague is bittersweet. Best wishes to you, Billy. Thank you for your service to EOG. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question today comes from Steve Richardson with Evercore ISI. Stephen Richardson : Ezra, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the gas outlook, particularly as it regards Dorado. I appreciate that you're moderating activity in the near term. But maybe you could talk a little bit about if the forward curve, it sounds like you all are pretty bullish on demand and the forward curve certainly reflects that -- [ $3.50, $4 ] out on the curve.  Maybe talk about what could happen in the play in terms of where that one-rig program goes. And maybe also remind us as Verde gets into Phase II, do you all need to drill to fill? Or how do I think about the flexibility up down of that play once the infrastructure is complete? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Steve, that's a great question. This is Ezra. So you're right, gas, obviously, it's stating the obvious, but inventory levels are very high after 2 consecutive warm winters. But I will highlight in the last 2 years, we've also seen strong demand on the power side during the last 2 summers. And we expect that to obviously continue into this summer. So strong summer demand, coupled with the reduced supply, not only from some operators curtailing but just from the reduction in rig activity we see the potential inventory levels could come off quite a bit in the second half of the year.  Now that said, overall, we're maintaining flexibility with investment into those gas plays and dominantly what we're talking about is Dorado. I would say, Steve, we really would prefer to keep some rig activity running and really continue to capture the operational efficiencies. It's always difficult when you actually completely shutter a program. Unfortunately, in some of our plays that happened obviously during COVID in 2020. So we'd prefer to continue to capture our learnings and continue having a rig operate in the area.  But we do have a lot of flexibility on the completion side. And so you could look to us to potentially build some DUCs more so DUCs than necessarily hold back on turn-in lines, although we've done that before as well, but we prefer to be flexible on our completion schedule side.  As far as commitments to filling the infrastructure, no, Steve, we don't have any of that for us. What's going to really determine the pace of our investment there and when we bring the gas online, it's really a returns-based question. That's one reason that we did, in fact, put the infrastructure in ourselves is it's really in line with our longer-term marketing strategy which, of course, is duration, flexibility, diversity of markets and most importantly, in a situation like this, control. And so we don't have any obligations necessarily to deal with. Stephen Richardson : Great. And so Ezra, would you, [ hastily ] guess. I appreciate that you've got this downside flexibility in a low price environment, but in a $3.50 or $4 price environment, could we see activity go to 2 to 3 rigs or don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but -- and I appreciate that there's probably efficiencies you want to retain on the upside as well. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Steve -- the last part you touched on is exactly the right way to think about it. It's the way that we think about it. We don't want to outrun our pace of learning. Now we are very constructive on the longer-term gas forecast for demand in North America. And we've talked about it before. We think Dorado is advantaged, not only with the cost of supply, but really with the geography where it's located, so we can service all the upcoming demand along the Gulf Coast.  But the thing about a gas play is we're very committed to making sure that this is a low-cost asset. That's the most important thing because while we're constructive on a mid-cycle gas price increasing throughout the rest of this decade, it's easy to see that gas historically has been very volatile because no matter what you need to layer in weather on top of whatever gas supply-demand model you've created.  And so the most important thing for us is, even in the early days of investing in this place, making sure that we're investing at a pace to optimize the returns and optimize the cost of supply and keep our cost basis low, so that we can continue to have a positive cash flow through some of those skinny times.  So I'd say we could look to increase the activity I think we've talked in the past of being prepared to increase it with the upcoming LNG and just overall demand. But as far as assigning a hard level to it, Steve, we'll have the infrastructure in place. We have the -- not only the takeaway infrastructure but in-basin, things like sand and water -- water, mines and things of that nature. So we could ramp it up. But you should look at us to ramp it up commensurately with our learning, which would be at a more measured pace. Operator : And our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Securities. Arun Jayaram : Ezra, you returned over 100% of your free cash flow this quarter, above your 70% target for the year. I was wondering what the signals to the market -- historically, you haven't returned this level of cash flow. So -- outside of the fact that you thought your stock call below $120 was dislocated, any other implications you think to the market from this -- from the buyback activity in the quarter? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Arun. This is Ezra. I'd say last year, we did return to the market through buybacks and specials and our regular dividend, about 86% of the cash flow. So having higher quarters is not out of line. The big difference, as you highlighted is that it was all biased towards buybacks rather than specials. And that's really been the trend over the last few quarters and I think that trend will probably continue.  The reason I say that is our business has really strengthened substantially over the past few years, as we've highlighted before, not only in our core assets like the Permian and Eagle Ford, but especially in these emerging plays, Utica, the Dorado, we're just talking about it, even the Powder River Basin. And really, it's -- the entire energy sector, EOG certainly, we think, remains undervalued relative to the broad market. And those are really the big things that provide us confidence to continue buying back our shares.  In general, I'd say our cash flow allocation priorities remain unchanged. It is focused on the regular dividend. But we will continue to be opportunistic on share buybacks, and we'll use market volatility to our advantage. And we've really been doing that now as we've been in the market repurchasing shares for the past 5 quarters. I'd say we'll continue to evaluate the opportunities as they present themselves on how best to return cash to the shareholders.  But the feedback that we've received is the shareholders appreciate our approach. And as I said, we've been biased to buybacks for the last couple of quarters. And for the time being, you can certainly see that probably proceeding going forward. Arun Jayaram : Great. My follow-up, Ezra, based on the 2Q guide, you're spending around 56% of your full year CapEx in the first half. I was wondering how the timing of some of the strategic infrastructure spend you highlighted last quarter, how that's influencing the first half CapEx? And just thoughts on confidence in the hitting the $6.2 billion full year CapEx guide for 2024? Jeffrey Leitzell : Yes, Arun, this is Jeff. Thanks for the question. What I'd first say is our 2024 plan, it's playing out as we had expected. So everything is in line as far as timing, and we still feel really confident with the total CapEx budget of $6.2 billion. You did -- you hit it on the head, and we talked about it in our opening statements, CapEx will slightly be higher there in that first half. at that 56% of total budget, but that's really just due to some standard indirects. And really, those strategic infrastructure spends that we have talked about with the Delaware gas plant and the Verde pipeline there.  The nice thing about it is both projects are scheduled to come online. The gas plant, we've got planned for the first half of 2025. And the second phase of Verde pipeline is going to come on, hopefully, the back end of this year. we're really excited about it to be able to get to realize that $0.50-plus per Mcf GP&T savings that both those projects are going to bring for the life of the asset. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : I just love your perspective on the Eagle Ford and Bakken fields entered to more maturity. Some of your peers have talked on this earnings season about different things that they're doing to extend the life and deepen the inventory and just would love your perspective on some of the things you're doing on the ground to drive as much value as we get into the next phase of these assets. Jeffrey Leitzell : Yes, Neil, this is Jeff again. With the Eagle Ford, we've got a really good, consistent program this year. We're going to be completing about 150 net wells there. And as far as looking at the well performance, everything has been in line and right with our expectations. With any mature asset, you're going to see some productivity degradation. I mean we started out in the East where we had a little bit more prolific geology. And then more recently, we've moved out to the West, where it's slightly lower quality pay, but the key takeaway is we've been able to continue to improve the economics in that play year-over-year. And we've really done that just through -- as you talked about, increasing operational efficiencies and focusing on drilling faster, completing faster with super zippers, longer laterals and cost reductions that have continued to improve the capital efficiency of the play.  And what I'd say is also one of the big movements that we've had is we're actually increasing the lateral length there in the Eagle Ford, about 20% this year. So -- and you can see the activity might be down just a hair year-over-year, but we've completed the same amount of lateral length as we did in 2023 with those longer laterals. So that's just one of the ways we're really able to drive efficiency there. You can see it in the returns. I mean, really, it's got some of the highest rate of returns over the last 3 years, and we've been drilling in the Eagle Ford for 15 years.  And then looking over to the Bakken, we are very mature in that resource. Right now, we kind of run a program of about 10 net wells there. Primarily, they're just Three Forks targets and Bakken targets. And really, we're just going in and offset and infilling around some of our existing development. We're staying ahead of depletion. And then also, we've had some areas with limited markets, but we've got some new available capacity, so we're able to bring some additional wells online there.  So obviously, with a really oily play, the well productivity looks great on there and everything that's coming online is in line with our forecast, and we're excited about those wells this year. Neil Mehta : And then Billy, I just want to extend my congratulations to you on your retirement and thanks for the insight over the years. My follow-up is just on the macro, on the oil macro specifically. We've got OPEC meeting coming up here in the next couple of weeks and a lot of uncertainty on both the demand and supply side. So -- just how is this year from a commodity perspective -- oil commodity perspective trended relative to your expectations? And I know you have a big in-house operation looking at the macro. What's the crystal ball telling you, Ezra? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Neil. Well, I'd start with the fact that Q1, I think, has really played out as most people expected. There is a bit of a pullback in demand there. And that's one thing that had prompted I think, had prompted some of the spare capacity being brought offline. But ultimately, that demand was about 102 million barrels a day. It looks to us and others out there, other models, it looks like demand should strengthen throughout the year. So we have not only seasonal demand picking up here, but also we're seeing underlying strength in the U.S. economy. Also in the China, the Chinese economy, just a little bit, namely on the manufacturing side.  So ultimately, we see demand reaching a bit above 104 million a day in the back half of the year. And so that's on the demand side. When you think about inventory levels, obviously, first quarters with spare capacity offline, inventory levels have stayed just below that 5-year average, but products really are a bit lower. And so that shapes up for a good -- some good inventory draws potentially in the back half of the year.  And then really on the supply side, as I spoke about in the opening comments, we think U.S. supply should be pretty moderate. We're in agreement with other estimates of kind of that 300,000 to 400,000 barrel per day growth year-over-year. And that's where we arrive in a model that would indicate we see much of the spare capacity reentering the market throughout the rest of this year. But we'll see how that depends, how that really plays out, as you said, at the next upcoming OPEC meeting. Operator : Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Neal Dingmann : My first question today, is on your Utica play, specifically looking at the map on Slide 12, it appears you all continue to target more so the eastern side of the volatile window, I'm just wondering. Could you talk about your thoughts maybe on the prospectivity of the black oil window? And if there's just anything that you might see this year that might cause you to change activity in the play for the remainder of the year? Keith Trasko : Yes. This is Keith. You're right, we have been delineating mainly north south through the valid oil trend. It's a 140-mile area. The first thing we need to -- kind of on the west is we need to acquire seismic data. We're in the process of doing that. We need to see the degree of structural complexity kind of before we don't -- before we start developing. But geologically, in general, we don't see significant changes in thickness or pay from east to west. On the West, you're going to have a little bit lower maturity, which would equate to less pressure. But in our other plays, such as the Eagle Ford, less pressure reduces the well productivity, maybe a little bit, but it also reduces costs. So your economics are still really comparable to all the other portions of the play. And then overall, just on activity level, he asked, we have ramped up to 1 full rig this year. We want to be able to grow at a pace where we can leverage our learnings continue to get better and also drive costs down. We need to keep getting infrastructure in place in the basin like in-basin sand and water reuse. So we are sticking to our 2024 plan laid out last quarter of 20 net wells, and it's a little too early to disclose anything for 2025. But overall, this play really competes with our best place for capital. The other great thing is with the multi-basin portfolio, we don't necessarily need to ramp it up aggressively. We'll just kind of let returns drive that. Neal Dingmann : Very good details, Keith. And then just a second quickly on -- look at the supplement Slide 12, I like that slide you talked about just your marketing opportunity is. Statistically, I'm looking at sort of around the oil side, the U.S. oil. Is there opportunities to increase around the export side if opportunities present? Or maybe just talk about the optionality or flexibility you might have around those markets? D. Terveen: Yes, Neil, this is Lance. Yes, I think what we like best is just we are advantaged. When you think about just from the supply that we have out of the Delaware Basin, the capacity, the firm capacity that we have that can come into the Gulf Coast. And then the facility that we're down in the Eagle side, it's just -- it's an outstanding facility. They recently just increased the dredging that's there. So we're actually been loading [ DLCCs ] there. So the capability that we have there and our tank position, we've actually been pushing more across the dock into the export markets in the most recent quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Scott Hanold : Yes, thanks. A little bit more on the Utica. I appreciate the fact that you guys do not want to outrun your learning curve. But given that. You're demonstrating some pretty good competitive economics with places like the Permian, just big picture, like what needs to happen and what do you need to see for this to be become a more meaningful part of your capital allocation and production going forward? Ezra Yacob : Scott, this is Ezra. Yes, I think we're very happy with where we're at. It's over a 400,000-acre position. As Keith highlighted, it's 140 miles north to south. And let's be honest, we've got 2 packages on right now. Now the 2 packages are fantastic. They're exceeding what we initially had in our type curves, and they're more than confirming some of our early thoughts on the spacing test. So at this point, everything is going in the right direction.  As Keith highlighted, to help delineate some of the other acreage that we have, the first step is to -- well, really, the first step was having some of the well-log identification. So really, maybe the second step now is to go ahead and get that seismic and see what the level of complexity is.  As Keith talked about in his opening comments, we have brought on -- just brought on a package down in the south. Which will prove up -- it's a bit of a different geologic environment down there. It's also an area where we own the minerals, which is very exciting. You guys know the economic uplift that, that can have.  So overall, I would say that everything is right on pace. We'd like to continue to get some in-basin -- just infrastructure and be able to start to leverage the size and scale that we have. Maybe one way to think about it, Scott, is, in all these early resource plays think about where the Utica is. And maybe it's around where the Permian was in kind of 2012, 2013 time frame. And so that's why when we all talk about not outrunning our ability to learn, the costs that you're putting in the ground today, we think about it as full cycle economics, and they're going to stay with you on the life of this asset.  We're not at a point where we're in need of increasing the activity here. We've got a very deep high-return inventory across multiple basins, and that's really the big difference. I think our business model has changed as the company has matured, and we've built out that inventory where we don't need to lean in aggressively on any single one asset anymore. We've got the ability with this multi-basin portfolio that we can invest in each of these at a pace that really allows them to improve year-over-year.  Now we definitely want to bring some of these capital efficiency learnings from the Eagle Ford, the Bakken, the Permian, into the Utica. But we want to do it at a place where we're not -- we don't have the misses on spacing or higher well costs or things that have plagued some of the early learnings in these other resource plays.  So I wouldn't say we're looking for any major sign or any silver bullet that we're going to turn on a 15-rig program or anything like that, Scott. It's really the -- where our company is at, where we're at in the cycle, and it ultimately comes down to a returns-based decision not at the asset level, but really at the company level as to how to capitally allocate across the portfolio to maximize shareholder value. Scott Hanold : And before I ask my next question, I want to extend my congrats to Bill as well. Obviously, we all appreciated your insights and expertise over the years.  And so my follow-up question is, could you all refresh us on Trinidad a little bit? I mean, you obviously have some growth coming there that was planned, but remind us the economics and how pricing is set in that region relative to, say, like, what we're seeing with Henry Hub pricing? Jeffrey Leitzell : Scott, this is Jeff. Yes, just on the activity in Trinidad. We're currently just running our 1-rig program there and everything is going really smooth. Earlier this year, we completed 2 of our remaining wells there in the Modified U(a) Block successfully. And brought those online. And we're currently drilling and completing a couple of exploratory wells in the SECC block. And then after that, we'll move the rig and we've got a couple of recompletes to do in our Sercan area. And then one more exploration well to finish up the year in TSP area.  Another note that I'll point to you too is we're also installing our Mento platform. Everything has been on time and looking good there. getting the facilities in place, and that's in an SMR Block. And what that will do is that will really set us up for the program next year. So -- and as far as the marketing side, I'll hand it over to Lance to give a little color. D. Terveen: Yes, Scott, we've always been real pleased there in Trinidad, especially when we think about our price realizations and obviously meeting that local demand into the country. So I think you can see even with the price realizations that we had in their first quarter, they were very attractive. So we continue to see that kind of on a go-forward basis. Operator : Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with RothamKM. Leo Mariani : I wanted to just follow up a little bit more on the exploration side. Obviously, you guys seem happy where you are in the Utica. But just wanted to kind of ask in terms of activity levels. Is there other kind of ongoing exploration still this year in some of these U.S. oil stealth plays and perhaps you can just talk about kind of levels or wells? I know you're not going to reveal necessarily any of the specific areas.  And then just on a related point, obviously, you guys have talked about this exploration being able to kind of drive down the DD&A rates for the company. Happened to notice that your DD&A rate did go up a fair bit here in the first quarter versus where it was in fourth quarter. So maybe you could just kind of wrap it all together and give us some color around that? Ezra Yacob : Yes. Leo, this is Ezra. I'll start with the exploration and then hand the DD&A details over to Ann for an answer. On the exploration side, yes, we do have some exploration dollars in the budget this year, as we highlighted on the first quarter call. We continue to explore for -- yes, we continue to focus on oil plays. But at the core of it, what we continue to explore for things that are going to be additive to the quality of the corporate portfolio. And that's what you're seeing with the Utica, obviously. So that's a major success for us. We're not exploring for things that are simply just going to add inventory. We really want them to be additive on a returns basis, additive on a cost of reserves or refining and development cost basis, and that's how it contributes into lowering the DD&A rate.  This year, we are drilling a couple of what I would call initial wells or I hate to call them wildcat wells because these aren't frontier types of activities. These are in basins where there's data and there's been historic production and things like that, but let's call them, the initial wells to test some exploration ideas. And then we've still got another stealth player too that are a bit more in, say, a delineation phase, where we've drilled the initial well. We've seen -- we've been encouraged with the initial well results, and we're continuing to test and see if it's going to clear those hurdle rates that I talked about.  The big thing I'd say is these days are exploration plays in these initial wells I think I've highlighted this before. In the U.S., the way we operate through exploration, there's so much data that we're not really drilling these initial wells and to see if they'll actually produce oil and natural gas. It's not like we're testing whether or not the rock is productive and could we end up with a dry hole. These days, it's really about when we get the oil and gas to surface. Is it what we expected? Is it going to be economic in such a way that it really competes with the existing portfolio? Are we exploring? Have we found something that really commands investment and taking rigs off of another play.  And I'll hand it over to Ann. Ann Janssen : The DD&A, you saw an increase in the first quarter was just due to a onetime prior period adjustment due to some natural gas production being used in our gathering systems. We did come in at guidance level, and you can't expect that DD&A to moderate over the remaining 3 quarters for the year, respecting about $10.50 for the remainder of the year. Leo Mariani : And then I just wanted to follow up real quick. Obviously, you guys are pretty optimistic on natural gas kind of laid out some pretty big demand increases over the balance of the decade. You spoke a little bit about 2024, second half continuing to look better. Maybe if I just wanted to focus a little bit more near term. As you look at '25, strips kind of just north of [ $3.50 ] or so. Are you just increasingly bullish on '25? Do you think that strip price is pretty reasonable? Or do you think things can potentially be better than that? I think everyone is kind of on board that demand will be a lot better later this decade, but I just wanted to maybe focus a little bit more on kind of the next year or so. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Leo, this Ezra. I don't know if I'd call it bullish on '25, but I would say that we're constructive. As I said, we've seen a surprising upside on the amount of natural gas demand for power generation over the last couple of summers, and we continue to think that's going to be true this summer. That -- a big part of that is coupled with coal retirements. We also think the pull on natural gas this summer because pricing is soft, will also continue to be great as well. You combine that with the reduction in rig activities over the past 8 months or so, and the fact that operators now are also starting to curtail volumes. We think that's going to bring down the supply side to a point where you could actually make some pretty good progress on those inventory levels in the back half of this year. That with a little bit of feed gas starting to be taken on the LNG. It gives us a little bit of confidence headed into in '25. But you are right, there is a bit of -- there is quite a bit of an overhang right now that we need to see come off starting with this summer. Operator : The next question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Also I have to apologize, but I want to go back into Utica. If I'm looking at a well cost or that well productivity, what kind of improvement you need in order for you to move from the peso [indiscernible] to the -- or delineation [indiscernible] of the manufacturing or production development now? And also that, based on what you can see from your inventory backlog, what is the one that you feel comfortable about the delineation. What is the development program look like whether it's been the number of rig and crew or number of wells that you expect going to come from that on a per year basis. That's the first question. Keith Trasko : Yes. Paul, this Keith. So I'll start on the well cost. It's still early on the play that team continues to drive down the cost. We see a lot of room for further efficiencies, the consistent activity this year with 1 full rig has helped that a lot. We like that generally in the area, it's an easier operating environment compared to a lot of our other plays. That's consistent geology. It's a little bit shallower depths. Example of that is our 3.7 mile lateral we just drilled on the [indiscernible]. We also brought in an e-frac crew for higher pump rates and increased efficiencies. And Overall, we see development costs someday getting to be a little bit lower than the Permian, even on $1 per foot. But the great thing is that this play just has the opportunity to benefit from the learnings of all of our other plays and EOG best practices.  On the well performance side, we're really happy with the wells as I and Ezra, we kind of already touched on, we see that these compete with the best players in America, very comparable to the Permian on a production per foot basis both in oil and equivalents, really highlighting our differentiated organic exploration strategy.  The development program as far as rigs and crews and number of wells. It goes back to growing at that pace where we can still learn and just the multi-basin portfolio. We don't necessarily have to ramp this up aggressively. So. Paul Cheng : I see. Before I ask my second question, I also want to add my congratulations and best wishes to Billy, thank you for the help over the past several years. The second question, I think, is for Ann. This year that you have about $400 million on strategic infrastructure spending. I assume that it's not every year, you will have that. But throughout the cycle, you're always going to have some strategic infrastructure spending, I suppose. So what will be a reason of [indiscernible] based for the cycle assumption for the strategic infrastructure spending and also that add to overall spending level for the infrastructure all along D&C for you guys? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Paul, this Ezra. Yes, the $400 million of infrastructure, the strategic infrastructure that we've highlighted before, which we couldn't be more excited about because of some of the long-term margin expansion benefits that Jeff highlighted it in the opening remarks. These are projects that, historically, we look for opportunities like this, but they're very rare to present themselves where we can take on infrastructure projects that generate such a compelling rate of return. We've talked about the Verde pipeline is expected to generate about a 20% rate of return uplift. And then on top of that, we get that GP&T savings, a netback uplift of $0.50 to $0.60 per Mcf over the life of the asset.  Similarly, on Janus, the gas processing plant in the Permian Basin, that one also has roughly an anticipated 20% rate of return. And then on that one, we have a GP&T savings, a net back uplift of about $0.50 an Mcf. If we could continue to find some of these projects with that strong of a return profile and that much value creation for the shareholders over the life of the assets, we would be interested in continuing to do them.  But to be perfectly honest with you, Typically, those margins get squeezed down to a point where we don't want to do them. It's really more beneficial for a third party to come in and do them. But there are times in the cycle where -- and it seems to happen every 5, 8, 10 years or so, where there ends up being enough margin there where we see the opportunity to go ahead and capture that value for our shareholders. Operator : Our next question comes from Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. Derrick Whitfield : Leading on the Utica, it sounds like the southern part of the trend could be advantaged on returns based on the elevated NRIs and potential geology. Could you perhaps expand on the difference you're seeing in the geology between the north and the south? Keith Trasko : Yes. This Keith. So yes, it's still early in the play. We're learning more every day about how the geology ties to production. It's going to obviously vary over the 435,000 net acres. But in general, the Utica is thicker in the North. The South is a little bit better pay, but it has better geomechanics and rock properties. That has to do with frac barriers and keeping the frac energy more contained near the wellbore. So we expect, as we gather more data, different areas are going to have different type curves. Geology is also going to drive the spacing too. But we're real happy with the rail results in all of the areas. They're exceeding expectations, generating great returns and we're happy so far with these white rhinos that are down in the south.  So they're still cleaning up. They've gone on for a couple of weeks. We're seeing a little more liquid yield compared to the Timberwolf and Xavier. And you're right, those do have the minerals, they benefit from that, and we'll be able to update you when we have a little more production data. Derrick Whitfield : Great. Then bigger picture question on the PRB Niobrara. Assuming further D&C optimization efficiencies based on your progress to date, could this play compete with the Delaware and Eagle Ford over time in returns? Jeffrey Leitzell : Yes, Derrick, this Jeff. So yes, we've made a lot of really good strides there in the PRB. We started out really focusing in on that deeper Mowry really to refine our geologic models kind of throughout the whole section. And we had good success with the Mowry with that. We went into package development last year, and we saw with package development, a really good uptick in overall productivity there, about 10% in Mowry. So once we accumulate enough data, we went ahead and we're moving up in section in the package development there in the Niobrara. and just really started drilling some wells this year, having really good success operationally, and we'll look to be bringing some of those on later in the year here.  So in comparison to the Powder and the Permian, I mean, there's not many basins that are going to be like the Permian as far as overall productivity and results. It's just a little bit different. But there are some advantages up there. It's got a really low F&D cost and there's a lot of scale there. Obviously, we've got close to 400,000 acres and we're really just focused in down on the south Powder portion of that. So we've got a lot of expansion that we can take our learnings and we can move it up to the North Powder, which we've had some delineation wells and across the acreage from that aspect.  So we're excited about it. It's not moving as fast maybe as what the Permian Basin had but we're making really, really good strides. The returns look great on it, and the teams are continuing to make really good improvements from an operational aspect, and we are seeing premium returns on that play. Operator : The next question from Nitin Kumar with Mizuho Securities. Nitin Kumar : Congrats to Bill on the retirement. Thanks for all the help over the years.  Want to start off on Ezra, some of your peers have talked about refrac and recomplete activity in the Eagle Ford. You obviously have a long history in the basin and obviously are [indiscernible] technology. I just want to ask, what are your thoughts around refracs and could they compete with some of these new players like the Utica and others on economics? Jeffrey Leitzell : Yes. This Jeff. We obviously keep our finger on kind of what's happening with refracs and that technology out there. We've done tests in the past in multiple basins. And what we really find is just with our robust inventory across our multi-basin portfolio. The opportunity for refracs, we're much better to either go in and offset an existing completion that was maybe poor or lesser or just go ahead and drill a new well in a new section from that aspect.  And then the other thing that I'd point out is from refrac technology, I think there's still a long ways to go. I mean there's pretty crude approaches. To where you kind of do some Hail Mary fracs or have to install expensive additional casing strings. And you never quite get the productivity uplift that you're looking from an actual new well.  So no, right now, we see just a lot more potential in our existing inventory in the acreage that we have out there. We will keep an eye on the refrac technology and watch it advance and see if it has application, but we feel that going ahead and drilling a new well or an infill well is a much better investment. Nitin Kumar : Great. And I guess as a follow-up, we've talked a lot about gas macro today, but you have a pretty strong marketing arm. Are you starting to see demand pull directly from the producer from some of the AI or Mexican exports or any of these kind of tailwinds to gas macro demand that you're hearing about? D. Terveen: This Lance. Yes, I mean, it's still pretty early on the AI front. But I'd say when you think about us, you're right. I mean we do have a lot of capability and a lot of reach with the marketing arm. We are very pleased with the execution that we have. We talked a lot -- you heard even Ezra talk about the pillars that we have there with diversification and control the flexibility. All those things provide the reach that we need as we think about our price realizations [ sync ] into the most attractive markets. Operator : And our final question comes from David Deckelbaum with TD Cowen. David Deckelbaum : I just wanted to ask a follow-up just on the Utica, particularly as you fit into some of the analogs and other plays that you've been in, in the life cycle of that exploration and development program. How do you think about testing longer laterals in the Utica specifically over time? Which seems to be a play that's quite amenable to even lateral lengths beyond 3 milers versus attempting to get down your footage cost? Sort of where are we in the theoretical innings there? Jeffrey Leitzell : Yes, David, this Jeff. We're in the very early innings there. And what I'll say operationally is the Utica sets up, I mean, almost perfectly. It's the efficiency gains that we're able to see there, we're getting better with just about every well. And as Keith had talked about in his opening statements, we drilled our longest lateral there to date at 3.7 miles. Our program right now consistently is 3 miles, and the team plans on continuing to push that out just because we can do one runs in the laterals and stay on bottom longer and not have to trip out of the hole, and we really have no problems operationally completing the wells.  So I think the play I'm looking forward to is as far as from longer laterals is, yes, we'll continue to push the limits there. We've got a lot of other drivers. It's not just the cost per foot metric we're looking at. There's other movement that we have that we'll be able to lower cost. But I would expect as we continue on with the operational successes we have, we will be drilling longer and longer there in the Utica. David Deckelbaum : Appreciate that. And just my final question. Just as you think about the incremental few hundred million spent this year on strategic infrastructure, and some other projects along the infrastructure side. How do you think about sort of the forward capital intensity of infrastructure as you continue developing in the '25 and '26 and beyond? Is that a number that should increase with intensity every year just given some of the infrastructure calls that are out there currently? Or is this sort of what you feel is like a steady run rate as a percentage basis? Ezra Yacob : Yes, David, this is Ezra. Those are fixed projects, the strategic infrastructure that we're talking about. And so the best kind of way to look at it, maybe is to reference that 3-year scenario that we have out there. Now that is not guidance, but it is a scenario that potentially assumes a similar macro environment to what we've seen in the last few years. And what we could do going forward.  And what you see there is maybe not as much capital intensity, but you see there is an expansion of our cash flow and our free cash flow. And that's really the thing that we focus on. And that's the important thing to keep in mind, when we talk about these strategic infrastructure projects, and it's something I highlighted before is that when you can invest -- we're not aggressively seeking out these strategic infrastructure, these infrastructure projects. But when you have the opportunity to invest in something that offers a very compelling rate of return upfront, and it gives you the margin expansion for the life of the asset. That's definitely an opportunity that we want to grab. So one of the ways that we continue to lower the cost basis of the company. And it's one of the ways that in that 3-year scenario, you see the free cash flow margins expanding. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question session. I would like to turn the call over to Ezra Yacob. Ezra Yacob : Thank you. We appreciate everyone's time today. I'd like to hand the call over to Billy to wrap up. Lloyd Helms : Thank you, Ezra, and thanks to all of you for your kind remarks, and I truly have enjoyed the chance to meet all of you and work with you in the past. Let me just add, I've been blessed to be part of this company, and its unique culture for the past 43 years.  Working beside so many talented people and watching the company grow and to become a leader in the industry. And while I certainly will miss the daily interactions, I take with me incredible memories. And I have great confidence in the leadership team and look forward to watching EOG's continued success. So thank you. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.",

In addition, some of the reserve estimates on this conference call may include estimated potential reserves as well as estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chairman and CEO; Jeff Leitzell, Chief Operating Officer; Ann Janssen, Chief Financial Officer; Keith Trasko, Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production; and Lance Terveen, Senior Vice President, Marketing. Here's Ezra. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Pearce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered exceptional second quarter results, reflecting outstanding execution by our employees throughout our multi-basin portfolio. We earned $1.8 billion of adjusted net income and generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow. Every metric, production volumes, CapEx and per unit operating costs beat targets, driving another quarter of excellent financial performance. Our outstanding results year-to-date allow EOG to update our full year forecast for liquids production, cash operating costs and free cash flow. As seen on slide 5 of our investor presentation, we increased our target for full year 2024 total liquids production by 11,800 barrels per day. Increased production, coupled with a modest increase to forecasted operational efficiencies reduces per unit cash operating costs by $0.15, driving a $100 million increase to our forecasted free cash flow to $5.7 billion for the full year at the same strip prices of $80 oil and $2.50 natural gas. Illustrating the benefits of EOG's unique culture and decentralized structure. There wasn't one single operation or play that drove our second quarter out performance. Our decentralized operating teams utilize technology and apply innovation across our portfolio of assets to improve unit costs, well costs and well productivity. We made gains in both drilling and completions and every asset contributed. Our foundational Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford plays as well as our emerging Wyoming Powder River Basin, South Texas Toronto and Ohio Utica shale plays. The strength and depth of our multi-basin portfolio of premium assets is a tremendous advantage, and our focus on premium drilling means each of these assets competes against our premium price deck, measuring direct well investments against a $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas price for the life of the assets. That capital discipline provides EOG the flexibility to invest thoughtfully across all of our assets to support the pace of operations that is optimal for each individual asset to continue improve. We can adjust to dynamic market conditions such as the broader macro environment and basin-specific economic factors. As a result, we don't rely on any one basin, any one product or any one marketing outlet to drive our company's success. Capital discipline is core to EOG's value proposition, evidenced by our ability to generate free cash flow for eight years in a row and is what drives our ability to deliver the consistent performance that our shareholders have come to expect and to create long-term shareholder value through the cycle. EOG's outstanding and consistent operational and financial performance positions us to deliver on our cash return cash return commitments in 2024. Our strategy continues to be grounded in our regular dividend, which has never been suspended or reduced in 26 years and supplemented with special dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. Our disciplined and balanced investment in foundational plays, emerging assets, and strategic infrastructure, all supported with a pristine balance sheet is laying the path to increase near and long-term free cash flow. The overall macro environment remains constructive. Global oil demand continues to increase after a seasonally soft first quarter and is in line with our forecast. As anticipated, domestic oil supply growth has moderated since last year as a result of consolidation in the industry and reduced drilling and completions activity stemming from industry capital discipline. Activity levels, as reflected in rig count indicate continued lower oil production growth through at least mid-2025. We expect Lower 48 U.S. supply to exit 2024 at roughly the same level as year-end 2023, with only modest gains to total U.S. oil supply from offshore -- as offshore production increases. Regarding North American natural gas. During the second quarter, inventory levels move closer to the five-year average, and we expect this trend to continue due in part to supply curtailments and increasing year-over-year demand. We remain optimistic on the long-term outlook for gas demand beginning in 2025, as a result of additional LNG capacity coming online and continuing increases in demand from electricity generation. We will continue to prudently manage our Dorado activity as the current environment continues to highlight the importance of being a low-cost supplier of natural gas with access to multiple diverse markets. This quarter, we have further expanded our marketing outlets, capturing additional interstate pipeline capacity to deliver natural gas to demand centers in the Southeastern U.S. In a moment, Lance will provide details on this exciting opportunity as well as updates on our ongoing infrastructure projects. EOG's performance this quarter can be summed up as exceptional operational execution drives exceptional financial performance, resulting in more volumes and lower per unit operating costs for the same CapEx, yielding higher free cash flow for the year. Anne is up next to provide an update on financials and cash return to shareholders. Here's Ann. Ann Janssen : Thanks, Ezra. EOG continues to create long-term shareholder value. During the second quarter, we earned $1.8 billion of adjusted net income and generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow on $1.7 billion of capital expenditures. Second quarter capital expenditures finished lower than expected due to the timing of certain indirect and international projects, along with contributions from efficiency gains above what we forecasted at the start of the year. Jeff will discuss these operating efficiencies in a moment. We also paid a $0.91 per share dividend and repurchased 690 million of shares during the quarter. In the first half of 2024, we generated $2.6 billion free cash flow, helping fund cash return to shareholders of $2.5 billion. We have paid over $1 billion in regular dividends and repurchased more than $1.4 billion in stock through the second quarter while maintaining a pristine balance sheet. Taking into account our top-tier full year regular dividend, we have already committed to return $3.5 billion to shareholders in 2024. We are on track exceed not only our minimum cash return commitment of 70% of annual free cash flow, but also last year's cash return of 85%. EOG's commitment to high-return investments is delivering high return to our shareholders. A growing sustainable regular dividend remains the foundation of our cash return commitment and is the best indicator of the company's confidence in its future performance. Special dividends and share repurchases are employed opportunistically to supplement our top-tier regular dividend. Since putting the $5 billion share repurchase authorization in place over two years ago, the fundamental strength of our business has improved as demonstrated most recently by our exceptional second quarter and year-to-date performance. We continue to get better through consistent execution of EOG's value proposition. As a result, over the last several quarters, we have favored buybacks and we will continue to monitor the market for opportunities to step in and repurchase shares throughout the year. Since the authorization has been put in place, we have repurchased nearly 21 million shares, which is more than 3% of shares outstanding at an average price of about $118 per share, totaling about $2.4 billion worth of shares repurchased. Now here's Jeff to review our operating results. Jeff Leitzell : Thanks, Anne. I'd like to first thank our employees for their outstanding execution this quarter. Your dedication to and focus on operational excellence extends our momentum from the first quarter and puts EOG in great position to finish the year strong and deliver exceptional value to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we beat targets across the board, including production volumes, per unit operating costs and CapEx. Oil volumes came in above target due to a couple of drivers. Production in our foundational Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford plays is outpacing our forecast due to better well performance on a collection of packages. Also, our base production performance continues to improve due to the application of proprietary EOG technology. Over the last several years, we have developed in-house artificial lift optimizers for several functions, including gas lift, plunger lift and rod pump operations. These state-of-the-art optimizers use algorithms to automate the set points of artificial lift and cost factors that allow for real-time adjustments to maximize production and reduce interruptions of third-party downtime. These cross-functional efforts by our production, marketing and information systems teams continue to improve and pay dividends. The final driver of our second quarter volume beat was timing. We were able to bring online a package of wells a full month earlier than anticipated. As a result of volume performance beats to date and updates to our full year forecast for Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford production, we are increasing our annual volume guidance by 1,800 barrels of oil per day and 10,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids. The volume uplift helps lower our per unit cash operating cost guidance for the full year, as well as generates additional free flow. Total well costs are trending in line with our expectations and resulting in a low single-digit year-over-year decrease. Driven by both moderate market deflation and drilling efficiency gains, we are seeing these cost improvements across our entire multi-basin portfolio. Regarding service costs, depletion is playing out as we had forecasted at the start of the year. Spot prices for certain services have trended lower, while high-spec rigs and frac equipment remain relatively stable. We have secured 50% to 60% of our service costs with contracts in 2024, primarily for high-spec high-demand services to ensure consistent performance throughout our program. By securing these resources, we're able to focus on sustainable efficiency improvements to progress each one of our plays at a measured pace. In our foundational Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford plays, Operational efficiencies are driven primarily by longer laterals, improving drilled feet per day. Longer laterals allow for more time being spent drilling downhole and less time moving equipment on the surface. In addition, the more we extend laterals, the more benefit we derive from our in-house drilling motor program. EOG motors drill faster and are more reliable, which becomes more impactful on our drilling performance as lateral length increases. In the Eagle Ford, we are on target to extend laterals by 20% on average and the year-to-date results has been a 7% increase in drilled feet per day. In the Delaware Basin, more than 50 wells or nearly 15% of our 2024 drilling program will use 3-mile laterals compared to four 3-mile laterals last year. Year-to-date, the efficiency impact from our 3-mile program in the Delaware Basin is a 10% increase in drilled feet per day. In the Utica Shale, we continue to collect data from our new packages and evaluate production history from existing wells as we test spacing patterns and completion designs across our 140-mile acreage position. Two new well packages, the Northern shadow wells and Southern White Rhino wells, as seen on Slide 12 of our investor presentation, have delivered strong initial results and continue to demonstrate the premium quality of this play. In addition to strong well results, since last quarter, we have added another 10,000 net acres to our Utica Shale position, bringing our total to 445,000, while we continue to make delineation progress, our focus in the near future for Utica development will be on the 225,000 net acres in the volatile oil window, where we have a more comprehensive geologic data set. Our large contiguous acreage position in the Utica lends itself to developing a long-life, repeatable, low-cost play competitive with the premier unconventional plays across North America. For 2024, we are on target to complete 20 net wells in the Utica across our northern, central and southern acreage, which supports a full rig program and enables significant well cost reductions. In Dorado, we continue to leverage the operational flexibility provided by our multi-basin portfolio to moderate and manage activity through the summer. Earlier this year, we decided to defer completions while retaining a full rig program to maintain operational momentum. As a result, the drilling team has achieved a 13% increase in drilled feet per day year-to-date. Maintaining a steady drilling program allows us to capture corresponding efficiencies in advance and improve the play, while we continue to monitor the natural gas market. Gas prices are improving into the second half of the year, and we remain flexible to respond to the market. As the year unfolds, we will continue to maintain capital discipline and leverage the flexibility of our multi-basin portfolio to ensure consistent execution across all operating areas. We also remain highly focused on sustainable cost reductions through innovation, operational performance and efficiency improvements to further drive down our cost structure and expand EOG's capacity to generate free cash flow. Here's Lance for a marketing update. Lance Terveen : Thanks, Jeff. I'll be updating on our strategic infrastructure investments in the Delaware Basin and Dorado, as well as the exciting progress we have made expanding access to premium natural gas markets. First, in the Delaware Basin, our Janus Gas Processing Plant is on schedule to start up in the first half of 2025. This 300 million cubic feet per day plant will be instrumental and lowering our cash operating costs and improving netbacks. The Janus plant will have connectivity to the new Matterhorn Express Pipeline estimated to be in service the fourth quarter of this year. EOG has firm capacity on Matterhorn, which will allow us to move additional residue gas out of Waha to the Katy Houston Market Center. Most importantly, we expect our Waha gas exposure on a total company production basis to be only 5% in 2025. Furthermore, our new Matterhorn capacity already has in place term sales, along with additional downstream connectivity. Next, in our emerging South Texas Dorado natural gas play, Phase 1 of 36-inch Verde Pipeline is in service with safe, consistent operations, and we are on schedule to bring online Phase 2 in the second half of 2024. We are excited that Phase 2 of the Verde Pipelines terminus is the Agua Dulce market hub. While our current cash costs in Dorado are approximately $1 per Mcf, we expect the combination of Verde Phase 2 and the premium markets accessed at Agua Dulce will further expand our margins, positioning Dorado as one of the most competitive, lowest cost and highest return natural gas plays in North America. At Agua Dulce, we have executed agreements for three interconnects directly from our Verde pipeline, including White Water's new ADCC pipeline, supplying Cheniere's Corpus Christi LNG terminal. Enbridge's Valley Crossing pipeline with access to industrial, LNG and Mexico markets and Williams Transco pipeline expansion, the Texas to Louisiana Energy Pathway Project, or TLEPP, reaching entire Gulf Coast corridor, which is illustrated on slide 10 in our investor presentation. TLEPP received FERC approval at the end of June and is currently under construction and expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2025 EOG is contracted for the entire 364,400Btu per day of firm capacity. Through TLEP, we expand our access to a valuable liquid market center that serves robust southeastern power generation and additional future demand. Our capacity on TLEP is in path for supply from multiple EOG assets, including Dorado from our Verde pipeline and the Permian Basin from our capacity on the Matterhorn pipeline. Securing capacity on TLEP is consistent with our broader marketing strategy to diversify our end market options. We continue to expand our access to multiple premium markets, serving customers from LNG to industrials to utilities and more while optimizing our valuable transportation position. Now here's Ezra to wrap up. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Lance. I'd like to note the following important takeaways. EOG has delivered another outstanding quarter. Strong employee-driven operational performance produced strong financial performance. Our multi-basin asset teams continue to drive innovation and increase capital efficiency, not only on new wells, but by applying technology to our base production. We are delivering more volumes and lower per unit costs for the same CapEx resulting in higher free cash flow for the year. Capital allocation across our foundational plays, emerging assets and strategic infrastructure is delivering strong near-term free cash flow while also laying a path to future free cash flow generation. EOG continues to expand an already diverse marketing strategy. Following our announcement of a new Brent-linked gas sales agreement earlier this year, this quarter, we have announced additional natural gas pipeline connections further reducing our exposure to in-basin differentials and exposing us to multiple demand centers. And lastly, EOG continues to deliver on its cash return commitment. While our regular dividend is the foundation of our cash return strategy, we are well positioned to continue delivering additional cash return through share repurchases and special dividends, supported with the strength of our balance sheet and low-cost operations. Including our annual regular dividend and share repurchases in the first half of the year, we have already committed to $3.5 billion in cash return and are well positioned to exceed our minimum cash return commitment. Thanks for listening. We'll now go to Q&A. Q - Arun Jayaram : Good morning. I wanted to start in the Utica Shale, I was wondering if you could give us a sense of some of the key learnings thus far, including your initial test in the South and perhaps discuss maybe the glide path towards shifting into development mode. What are some of the key risks from here that you need to get comfortable with before shifting into development? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Arun. This is Ezra. Let me start the last part of your question there, and then I'll hand it off to Keith Trasko for a few more of the details on the Utica play. What I'd say in the Utica overall is that we're very happy with the results that we've seen to date. The Southern wells, the White Rhino's that we've talked about are right in line with the expectations in Northern Wells are consistently strong results and very repeatable. So ramping up the Utica, I mean, it's going to be like any other play that we have in our portfolio. We want to invest in it at the right pace so that we can continue to learn and embed those learnings into the next well, and Keith will mention some of those learnings here in a minute. Ultimately, as we do continue to delineate and invest more capital out there, it's going to be at a level of reinvestment that really reflects the maturity of that asset. And when we do that across our multi-basin portfolio, that's when we really start to drive down the cost of all plays and expand the margins at the corporate level. Keith Trasko : Yes. This is Keith. On the well results so far, the recent ones, we're very pleased overall, I feel like we're making great delineation progress. Some of the key learnings so far, White Rhino, that is our prospects down the south, the performance we're seeing to date meeting expectations has a little bit lower BOE IP30. That was something we were expecting because of a little bit of thinner reservoir down there, but it really benefits from the strategic mineral ownership which really enhances the returns by voting the royalties down there. That has a really big financial impact. The Shadow package that we just recently brought on, that's an offset to the Timberwolf\u2019s. We're seeing consistently strong results at tighter spacing there. We did a 700-foot spacing test there versus 1,000. Spacing overall, I'd say, so far so good. We're excited about the consistency so far there. We're going to keep incorporating data, as future development decisions go there. But we're still early in the play. We need a little bit longer production history. We look at a lot of different things as far as the two- and three-stream production, the pressure, we're taking a lot of real-time measurements, choke schedules, those sorts of things. And we expect this basin will probably change across the play based on geology. It's just a really large acreage position. But I'd say, with our learnings, we're constantly bringing those into our decisions. We are really pride ourselves on not getting into manufacturing mode and instead kind of developing the acreage package by package, integrating the latest data and learnings trying to maximize returns and the value capture. Arun Jayaram : Okay. My follow-up is \u2013 maybe, Jeff, if you could elaborate on some of the technology on the artificial lift side that you've been incorporating. What are some of the potential financial implications? Does this have a positive impact on your decline rates, sustaining capital requirements, but give us a sense of the big picture in terms of the artificial lift technology? Jeff Leitzell : Yes. Thanks, Arun. Well, as we talked about, we've been developing this technology over the last few years. And it's one of the big reasons. Obviously, we had the increase to guidance this quarter, and it really had to do with better base production kind of across the full portfolio. And it has to do with these artificial lift technologies that we're implementing. So for instance, and we've talked about it a little bit, we have a program that optimizes our gas lift. So it will basically monitor and through algorithms iterate how much gas we are injecting downhole to maximize production on the full bank of wells that it's supplying gas to. And then if we ever have any kind of downstream interruptions, it can it can divert gas and move it to the higher producing wells to make sure we're maximizing the production potential through that downtime event and then it can switch back to optimal normal operations. So -- we've done that exact same thing with a plunger lift optimization and then also on rod pump to run exactly how fast the rod pump is working and to optimize the lift of the oil on all of our wells out there. So -- yes, it's been absolutely a big mover, and we've implemented it pretty much around our multi-basin portfolio. And I think you're seeing the benefits of it right now in the base production. And we expect to obviously be moving forward to have less downtime and be able to maintain a better base production as we move into the future. Operator : The next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Neil Mehta : Yeah. Thank you, Ezra and team. Ezra, I always value your perspective on the oil macro, particularly around the Lower 48. What's your view of how exit to exit is tracking? It does seem from this earnings season, whether it's you or the super majors, the execution from a production standpoint has been very good and how do you think this plays out in '25? Especially given the fact that OPEC has that spare capacity and indicating the return of supply into the market? So macro thoughts on the shale trajectory would be terrific. Ezra Yacob : Yeah. Thanks, Neil. Appreciate the question, the opportunity to talk a little bit about the macro. If we started a little bit more of the broad level, I think what we're seeing is global demand is increasing year-over-year, essentially in line with our expectations, which is quite a bit less than 2023 over 2022. Even China, I'd say that has a lot of questions China demand is even kind of in line, demand is in line with our expectations the year. For us, on US supply, I think we've talked about on previous earnings calls for crude, we're looking -- we feel somewhere between 300,000 and 400,000 barrels a day annually would be the increase. In total liquids maybe closer to 500,000 barrels a day. When you look at what's happening in the Lower 48 specifically, as I said in the opening remarks, we think from December to December, it will be relatively flat. We've had relatively flat DUC counts for the past months. And even though, as you're highlighting, there's -- everybody seems to be reporting on the margin, some increased operational efficiency, it's really rig count that's remained flat and then completion spreads that have remained flat as well. And so when we roll all that up, we continue to see not only the effects of consolidation in the industry, but just overall industry discipline really being the drivers of that more moderate US growth. And we think that will continue not only into 2025, but really for the next few years moving forward. Immediately, as I discussed with the current rig counts where they have been for the last eight, nine months, and where they look to be finishing the rest of this year at, that should drive moderate, potentially even less growth year-over-year than what we're seeing this year. And the last thing I think I'd point out is just the amount of decline. The US has grown so much in the last decade on the oil side and many of those barrels have been switched out from conventional resources into obviously more unconventional resources that come with a bit of a steeper decline. And so after years and years of growing, the US is finally looking at a spot where we have a very steep decline year-over-year as a country that needs to be filled in before new barrels can actually add to the growth. And those are the kind of key metrics that we continue to look at. But ultimately, it starts in the field at the asset level, looking at the activity and the capital efficiency of the plays. Neil Mehta : Thank you, Ezra. That's really helpful perspective. And staying on the macro and then tie it into your business. On natural gas, we've seen a lot of volatility, good price to start the year, obviously, very weak prices now. This morning, we had the 6-month pushout of Golden Pass. So -- just as you think about the '25 plan, is it fair to say you're going to try keep it a little bit more oil-weighted versus gas? And how does it affect how you want to deploy capital in gassier areas? Ezra Yacob : Neil, it's another good question. We -- at this point, Inventory levels are clearly above the 5-year average. And commensurately -- commensurate with that, the natural gas price is below the 5-year average. I will point out as we saw at the beginning of 2024, inventory levels can react very quickly on weather, specifically winter weather. But at this point, we do foresee that the inventory overhang will continue into 2025. I don't think we're alone with that idea. But we do forecast that we should bring down inventory levels to the 5-year average throughout 2025, assuming kind of a normal winter. And that's not only due to the increase in demand throughout the year from LNG and increased electricity demand. Recently -- certainly didn't help, but this summer, we did experience some off-line demand in LNG. But even with that, overall, we're still seeing an increase in year-over-year domestic demand. I think electricity is trending on about a 4.5% increase year-over-year and so all those things continue to be positive in the longer term. So specific to what we're talking about in 2025, we haven't -- we're not prepared today to talk about 2025. I'm sure heading off a question that probably comes up later on the call with that. But what I'd say is we are actively managing our Dorado program. We've done that last year, and we did that this year. Longer term, as I said, we do expect we're very bullish on pricing through there. And so we are managing the Dorado program to align with demand. We prefer to manage Dorado on the upfront kind of investment side. I think Jeff mentioned in the opening remarks, the benefits we've seen of running a consistent rig program there, increased drilled feet per day by 13% year-over-year. I think if you look at the past 2 years, it's closer to 30% over the past 2 years. But then once we get the gas molecules online, as Lance mentioned, we do have a low cash operating cost of $1 per Mcf. That's a dynamic number as we sit here today. And so that gives us a lot of confidence and flexibility on how to invest and how to think about Dorado going forward. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Richardson Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Steve Richardson : Thank you. Good morning. Really impressive realizations in the quarter, particularly relative to what we're seeing from the broader industry and can't help, but think it's largely to do with how unique your marketing organization is. Ezra, I guess the -- I would wonder if you could expound a little bit on the nature of the organization, right? You don't seem shy about deploying capital either in field or as we just heard with longer-haul pipes and everything else. But if you just take from the basis that you're trying to get the highest realization for your products and getting to the best sales point. How do you organize -- how do -- how do you incentivize that organization on returns? And you think about capital deployed in that business? And how to -- and performance of that business and how it adds value to EOG? Ezra Yacob : Steve, this is Ezra. I appreciate the remarks there and the question. Our marketing team is something we're extremely proud of and what we think is a real competitive advantage especially in a multi-basin portfolio a company such as ours. So, just maybe a few remarks by me, and then I'll hand it off to Lance to give some more details on it. Our overall marketing strategy, the first thing we always think about is really the netback pricing. And so taking on additional transportation is not a negative thing if it's getting you into premium markets, either for oil or gas. We like to have flexibility as we've talked about. Diversification, with access to multiple markets. We love to have control, where we get firm capacity from the wellhead to sales points. And then the duration. We've had times in the past where we've committed to long-term commitments, and we realize that's not what we want to do. We want to minimize those long-term kind of high cost commitments and really invest in with good partners that understand that we're trying to align our commitments with how -- we think about our growth of the individual assets. And we're consistently challenging the marketing team to think about being a low-cost operator. And that's also how we invest in some of these strategic infrastructure projects is what will they do for us over the long term with margin expansion. Lance Terveen : Yes. Right. And Steve, this is Lance. I think where I might add a little bit additional color too, when you think about how we're differentiated. I just -- it goes back to the culture, too. I think like our marketing teams like we're integrated in with our division operations. I mean our division operations, our marketing team, that's all integrated with our fundamentals. So, when we look at -- we can look at the global markets, as we think about LNG or exporting of our products. But then also when you get to like in-basin fundamentals, we have a strong grasp of that and what we see. And so then that way, we can set up and have multiple markets, and we can get to new markets like we announced with TLEPP that gets to a new premium market for the company to just further strengthen our netbacks long term. So, I'd say all what Ezra put together with his comments and then just the integration that we have internally to, I think, is a real differentiator. Steve Richardson : Appreciate all that additional info. Sort of -- if I could just follow up really quickly on service costs. I appreciate the comments that you're 50% to 60% contracted for 2024. I would be curious to hear what you're seeing on the leading edge across the supply chain and thoughts on what the back half of the year could look like, at least on parts of the bill materials that isn't contracted at this point? Jeff Leitzell : Yes, Steve, this is Jeff. Thanks for the question. When we look at service costs, what we do is we really break them down into a couple of categories. So, we have like our standard services, and then we have what we refer to as like our high-spec services, which is the majority of what we utilize as a company. On the standard kind of rig and frac pricing out there, what we saw as it started to weaken at the second half of last year. And it really varied kind of basin to basin based on activity levels. And the Permian, I would say, definitely had the most resilient pricing for service costs since ahead like over half of the rig activity. So, in general, I would say, since the middle of last year, standard rig and frac prices are down probably 15% to 20%. When you look at some of the support services over that same period, I'd say coiled tubing and wireline costs are probably down 15% and then then workover rigs have reduced about 10%. And just an additional thing that I'd point out is that through the first half of the year, we've really seen those reductions have kind of slowed as has Ezra talked about, with the rig count and the frac fleet count kind of stabilizing. So the big point out there, I'd say, is with the high-spec services that we utilize, we currently see relatively stable pricing and we probably will mostly through the rest of the year. But we have started to see a few areas of moderation and a little bit of spot availability, and it's primarily around the gas plays and outside the Permian. And then as you talked about, we're just locking up to 50% to 60% of our services. The way we do that, our contracting strategy is very strategic to where we stagger out our contracts. So we aren't rolling contracts off all at once. So we're constantly renegotiating new contracts and also renegotiating the spot market to make sure we're taking the best advantage we can of pricing that's out there. Operator : The next question comes from Leo Mariani from ROTH Capital. Please go ahead. Leo Mariani : I just wanted to follow up a little bit on your comments around how you're going to be kind of prudently managing your Dorado activity. I just wanted to get a sense, are you pretty much committed to kind of the 1 rig this year, it sounds like you want to get the wells drilled, but is there a potential to maybe defer some of those turn in lines or maybe choke back some of those volumes until later this year, just based on the weak current pricing. Obviously, I know you got the second phase of your Verde pipeline coming on, which is going to improve netbacks. But I was just hoping to get a little more color on how you kind of prudently manage that activity and how you're thinking about it? Jeff Leitzell : Yeah, Leo. This is Jeff. And as Ezra talked about earlier, there's really no change moving forward from what we had talked about last quarter. we're obviously managing the investment timing and it's primarily on the completion side where we just pushed a handful of wells into the second half of the year because we had some flexibility there. And as he said, we'll just be able to monitor those prices through kind of summer and fall and see what happens as we move into the back end of the year. With that, though, yeah, we're going to go ahead and maintain that 1-rig program really with no changes through the rest of the year. I mean the team has just done an exceptional job on building on their existing operational efficiencies. And as Ezra stated, I mean, they're already halfway through the year, they've seen a 13% improvement in their overall footage per day. So, the big thing is, if you look at the program, I mean, it's only a 20, 25 well program right now. We really want to build on that and continue to push the great technical and operational progress that we've made so far. And so we'll continue to do that through the year and stay on course with our current plan and just continue to make the best economic decision for the play as we move forward. Leo Mariani : Okay. I appreciate that. And then just with respect to the Utica, you made some comments that wells are sort of performing in line with expectations, but you also mentioned the fact that you continue to kind of experiment with spacing and completion design. So don't exactly know what the internal expectations are. But are you seeing the well performance trend better? Are the last two pads showing -- maybe just better EURs per foot versus where they were in 2023? Just trying to get a sense of trends on these wells and whether or not they're getting better and maybe that was what your internal expectation was? Keith Trasko : Yeah, this is Keith. I'd say they've met our internal expectation. We're expecting performance to vary over the 445,000 net acre position with the 140-mile span of it. We've been focused on our activity on the 225,000 net acres that we have in the volatile oil window? And we see changes in geology along there. We see we're going to have different spacing in different areas, different type curves in different areas, but we are constructive on the play overall everywhere that we've tested, and we think the variation that we're seeing is within the norm. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Scott Hanold : Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe sticking with the Utica and how you think about like marketing gas and some of your NGLs. Can you talk about the strategy as you look to eventually get to more scale development in the Utica? How you think about marketing those gas and NGLs? Lance Terveen : Hey, Scott, hey, good morning, this is Lance. Yes, when we look at the Utica, one of the things I like is -- I mean, it was -- it's very consistent. As we think about the early evaluation of the play. One of the things that's unique, again, I know we've commented on this in the past, but when you think about it, I mean, you don't really need a lot of major infrastructure build-out. I mean -- so what we've really been focused on from a marketing, midstream and within our division up there is really just getting the local gathering systems in place and those are both commissioned and online, and we're getting to the markets. I know we've talked a lot about there's just a lot of ample redundant processing capacity. Again, going back to my earlier comment about you don't need to make a lot of real long-term commitments. It's a place where we have measured pace, right? A lot of the acreage is all HBP. We can have a measured pace of production up there. But then from a commitment standpoint with being existing capacity and also very near to a pretty a pretty sizable local demand market on the crude oil side, too. So I think as you think about our strategy from a marketing standpoint, it will be very consistent with our other plays that we've had that have been very early in their development. So we'll be very measured. The crude oil will probably start with lease sales and then we'll kind of look at oil gathering. We're setting up and selling a lot of our crude into the local refineries today that's in that area. So I would say it aligns very much with what we've done in many of our other plays. Scott. Scott Hanold : Yes. Yes. And I guess delving into a little bit more specific on that, do you expect to try to get the gas that you produce out of the basin to get better pricing in with the NGLs? Would you try to find a way to maybe get to the export market in that area where you get much stronger pricing? So just more so on the NGLs than in the gas, like do you expect to get those out of basin? Or what's sort of the short and longer-term plan there? Lance Terveen : No, that's a great question. I think, again, I mean, not to kind of go back to my earlier comments, it's going to be a function of just the pace of the development there. And so commitments, we're going to be very disciplined there. But as you think about the gas markets there, especially at the tailgate from a residue standpoint, into the markets, there's a significant amount of just demand that's there kind of going through the Midwest, you have a lot of interstate connectivity. It's an extremely liquid market. So I think we're going to be pretty disciplined there, and I've been using that word quite a bit, but it's just not a need to really reach too further downstream. And then as you think about the NGL markets, there's a lot of -- it's a little bit different than other plays in that you have a lot of the local fractionation is kind of there within the state, right? And so a lot of the purity is being exported. So we're kind of already kind of participating in some of those aspects as well, just because that's some of the natural markets avenues for the products there on NGLs, Scott. Operator : The next question comes from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Please go ahead. Charles Meade : Yes. Good morning, Ezra, to you and the whole EOG team there, I'd like to go back to the Utica and the ShadowPad. So it looks like a really attractive IP30 you showed us there, relative to the wider space wells. But I'm curious if you could maybe offer a little bit more detail or insight on how those -- the spot rates are evolving from that pad. And if you have any sense of how long it will be before you're able to say that that the spacing policy is a success? Keith Trasko : This is Keith. So as far as how the -- I think the -- as far as how the rates are evolving question and talk a little bit about, like the product mix. So our IP30s are heavily oil weighted, heavily liquids weighted. We do see that in a lot of combo plays. So expect that early on, and we've seen that across all the well packages we have in the north and south. So we still estimate like a 60% to 70% liquids mix for the UR product. And so I'll tie back to a well that has a little more production history, which is the Timberwolf. So Timberwolf and also the Xavier package, that IP30 was around 55% oil cut. Those have been on for about a little over six months now, and we see closer to a 50% oil cut right now. So you see it moderate, but it's not a large drop overall. As far as how long to determine if the spacing is a success? It's going to vary in different places, but we just want to see more production data on the, I'd say, at least six months, nine months or so. And compare that to the data set that we have on some of our older packages, Timberwolf, Xavier, et cetera, and just see how they hang in there, see how the pressures look, et cetera. Charles Meade : Got it. That's helpful. So maybe midyear next year. And then a follow-up on the TLEPP project. I wonder if you could -- sticking on the theme with the midstream, but wondering if you could give us a narrative on how that project came together for you guys, particularly that I know a lot of people -- a lot of marketers have been trying to get east from the ship channel to markets East of there and how this came together and how it came to be that you're the 100% of capacity there? Lance Terveen : Hi, Charles, good morning. Thanks for the question. This is Lance. We could probably spend 30 minutes on that question, but I think Ezra is going to kick me over here if I spend too much time. But I'd say I talked earlier, one of the questions kind of related to just the marketing strategy and the integration that we have and we think about like the markets. And was something that we looked at as you asked the genesis of that. I mean that started all the way back in kind of 2022, right? And so we saw kind of that station 65 when you look kind of into that market was likely going to be very much premium market long-term. And so we worked alongside Williams there, went out for their open season, and we're able to capture all the capacity there through our precedent agreement. So that took a lot of time, I mean, I think you really have to have that foresight and then looking forward like into the markets. And then I think other thing I really want to capture is just that is all in path right, Charles. So I mean, when you think about like South Texas all the way through our Eagle Ford asset, all the way up into the Gulf Coast market. I mean, we can kind of capture everything, the Delaware Basin with our existing transport, our new transport that we're going to have on Matterhorn, all that that kind of gets in the path can kind of get into that market. So that's a little bit of that all came together because, yes, you have a lot of these pipes that are coming in to the Gulf Coast. And so as you've seen on some of our slides that we have there, especially related to gas sales agreements, you have to have end markets on the other side. So we've been very forward thinking there. You can see the ramp-up that we have in terms of other term sales that we have. So you need to have the transport position, Charles, but then you also need to be thinking about having strategic sales on the other side. And I think that's another thing that really differentiates us that we've got that in place now and then also looking forward. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning, team. Maybe this is for Jeff or maybe Ezra. I want to go back into artificial lift. I want to see that, I mean, the technology you use and how is that different than what is commonly available in the market today by some of the oil services. So in other words, that do you think your adoption that what gives you the edge comparing to your competitor? And whether that you can quantify, you talked about the base operation become better, how that improves your base decline rate? That's the first question. Jeff Leitzell : Thanks, Paul. This is Jeff. Yes, that's a great question. And with any of our technology that we developed. The beautiful thing about it is it's integrated within EOG with all of our different systems. So it communicates with all the data is getting all of our production data, all the all the pressures, all the flow rates, temperatures, everything real time. And so all that's flowing into the system, and you can see that, which with a lot of other third-party systems, that's not possible. On top of that, it also ties directly into our centralized control rooms, which is in each one of basins that watches our production real-time 24/7. And as these systems are optimizing at the control room can watch it, monitor and make sure that the iterated set points are correct then notify any people in the field real time to be able to go out and check on a well or make any additional changes that need to be done. So really, it has to do with the integration within our systems, it really kind of sets us apart from that aspect. And then on the decline rate side or I should say, at least from a base production and what our forecast is, you always have a certain amount of downtime that goes along with normal operations of wells. And what these optimizers really do is they help minimize that downtime. So instead of having a handful of percentage, you're able to actually knock off a percentage to downtime be able to keep these wells flowing and maximize the production across our multi-basin portfolio. Paul Cheng : That\u2019s great. The second question that I think, Ezra, you talked about. You guys can do quickly the rate if you want to increase activity level, what will be the precondition? I mean what do you look for in order for you to determine when is the right time for you to accelerate the rig activity or that even -- how many wells that you bring on the market? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Paul, this is Ezra. I think you broke up there just for a second. So I'm not sure if you're asking about the Bakken, Dorado or Utica, but obviously... Paul Cheng : I'm talking about Dorado. What will be the precondition for you to decide, okay, this is the right time, I want to increase activities and bring more gas to the market. Is it just simply price? Or are you looking for anything else? And it is simply the price or that you are looking for anything else? And increase of 5, is there price mix of that will be buying the impact trick upon? Ezra Yacob : Yeah. Thank you, Paul. So yes, with Drato, I think the biggest thing to continue to think about with any gas play, and for us, the dominant one is Drato. And you can see right now in the current environment, how volatile gas prices are is you've got to be committed to being the low-cost supplier. You've got to be a low-cost operator on the gas side because as we all know, the margins are pretty skinny, you can make up with it with low operating costs, gas is easier to operate in liquids. But then you need to make up for it with volumes. And then the second piece of it is you've got to be exposed to diverse markets because the volatility of gas means that you'll have arbitrages come and go very quickly. And if you've got the gas they're exposed to the market, you can capture those. If you try chase those arbitrages much like we saw in 2022 and 2023, by the time you can try to get your gas in position to capture an arbitrage, it might be gone. So those are the two things that we really focus on. In general, when you start talking about capital allocation to it, those comments you should read into is why we've continued to stick with a rig activity down there, kind of a minimal level of activity. so that we can continue, as Jeff highlighted, to learn, embed those learning's in the very next well and continue to be confident that when we see the emerging demand hit, which is coming in next few years with a lot of the LNG coming online, we'll be in a position to be able to bring to market, low cost reserves -- low-cost gas reserves. Now on the -- that's on the drilling side. On the completion side, we do have a lot of flexibility there. A great way to kind of overspend is if you're bringing in a frac spread and sending it out of the basin and bringing it back picking up water lines, laying them back down and things like that. So that's why we try to keep a drilling rig going, as I've talked about in the past, that's kind of the first hurdle to capturing economies of scale. Then the second one is trying to get your packages lined up. So when you bring a completion spread in, you can actually keep it for a significant number of wells and bring that on. What we look for in general to when we could take that next step. It's not only internal learning's, it's not only the returns that we're generating. But it is also with respect to the macro market. As I said on a previous question, the price essentially follows inventory levels or it's very lined out with that. We're below the five-year average right now on pricing and above the five-year average on inventory levels. So inventory levels are a big driver of what we're looking for. But then we're also cognizant of the supply and demand fundamentals for really North America or really just the US. And again, what we see is a lot of increased demand coming in the next few years. You have 10 to 12 Bcf a day arguably under construction right now that should be on really beginning throughout 2025. And then in addition to that, as you look at the back half of the decade, I think on the last earnings call, we highlighted our forecast for potentially another 10 to 12 Bcf a day of demand increasing from things like electricity generation, coal power plant retirements, just an increase in Mexico exports and then finally, just overall industrial demand growth. So we really look at it internally. Our ability to generate higher returns and embed our learnings, so that we're investing at the right pace. And externally, we look at supply demand and ultimately, the inventory levels, Paul. Operator : The next question comes from Doug Leggate from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate : Ezra, how are you? Thanks for having me on. Can you hear me okay? Ezra Yacob : Yes, sir, Doug, it's good to hear from you again. Doug Leggate : Good. I wasn\u2019t sure if I had gotten into the -- there, but I wonder if I could pull you back to the Utica just for a second. I mean, delineation is kind of a glacial event for a lot of companies. You guys have moved very quickly not only to lock down the acreage, but to demonstrably show that at least on our numbers, this is starting to look competitive relative to your Permian position. I'm just wondering how you would frame the extent to which you've derisked the play at this point and when you would anticipate a more meaningful development plan as you move forward? Is it infrastructure constrained? Or is there another reason that you're waiting? Because it looks like geologically, at least you're figuring this thing out. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Doug, I appreciate that. I think everything you're saying is correct. It's how we feel about it, too. geologically, we're doing a great job fearing out. I will point out the only caveat, I'd maybe make is we have, as Jeff pointed out, concentrated right now in in the volatile oil window. So, roughly 225, 000 out of the 445,000 acres. But you can see our confidence the fact that we continue to put -- we continue to put together some leased acreage as we increase the footprint about 10,000 acres. And it's not overly complicated, Doug. We've got multiple packages now in the north, and we're seeing consistently strong results. So, I would say we're feeling very confident there in the North. Certainly, as Keith and Charles were speaking about, we're not 100% satisfied with a spacing number if you wanted to get down that path. But in any North American shale play, you know as well as I do, the spacing is going to -- it's going to be between 600-foot and 1,000-foot spacing, probably on average, depending on the play. And then in the South, we only have one package really with any amount of data on there. So, we're a little bit further behind on delineation down there, even though that package did come online with our expectations. So, it's too early to talk about 2025, but just to call back, we have -- basically, we're planning on this year doubling the amount of wells to sales over what we did in 2023. And I think you're spot on, Doug, that we are seeing to-date with the early-time wells that we have, we're seeing that it's competitive with parts of the Permian Basin. Doug Leggate : That's what we are seeing as well. And I think, to be honest, I think some of us were a little skeptical to begin with, and you're proving, as you're proving us wrong. So, congratulations on that. My follow-up, there's been a lot of questions this morning on gas and the extraordinary realizations you guys have had, I think it was pointed out earlier, but my question is on the proportion of gas that you're prepared to commit to international pricing. I think right now, I want to say if I look out to the back end of the decade at your current volume, you're about halfway locked in, whether it be Brent-related or the other things that you pointed out. But in terms of your preparedness to step up your international exposure, what are you thinking as we see incremental LNG plants start to come out of the wood work, like the Woodside deal with Wheelan [ph], for example. Where would you be comfortable in terms of international exposure? I'm losing my voice, but in terms of international exposure, Ezra, as it relates to your total proportion of your volumes? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Doug, I appreciate that. We have -- as you've seen, we've got Slide 11 in our deck that kind of highlights what we've done with our gas sales agreements to expose us to pricing diversification, including the international. I'd point out, Doug, the biggest thing is when we entered into these agreements, as you'll recall, we entered -- we started negotiations and really entered into most of these and kind of a counter-cyclic time period. And so the first thing to keep in mind is, when we look at these opportunities, we want to make sure that we're being a low cost -- we're entering into a lower cost contract or gas sales agreement that's going to provide us with upside exposure. And then in the sales agreements that we've done to date, we feel like it limits our exposure to risk as well. One reason that we're able to enter into some of these agreements is just because of to be perfectly honest, the size and scale of what we've captured, mainly at Dorado, but also across other basins as Lance has talked about. So right now, as you pointed out, we're only really selling about 140 MMBtu per day that gets exposed to the uplift of JKM pricing. But from 2020 to 2023, as we highlighted on Slide 11, that's added about just over $1 billion worth of revenue uplift, which is outstanding. So even on small volumes, it can be a major impact on the revenue side. We're happy that, that's going to step up here in '25 and '26 as Corpus Christi brings on their Stage 3, and that will increase approximately to 720 MMBtu under a couple of different gas sales agreements that are outlined on that slide. And then as we've talked about last quarter, we made it yet another -- and I would call this countercyclic agreement because an agreement like this hasn't been done in North America for quite some time, but we actually have a Brent link now gas sales agreement. When we think about a percentage of our portfolio that we would necessarily like to have exposed to international, I'm not sure if we have a set percentage that we publicize right now because it really is dependent on the types of agreements and the marketing structures that we see available at the time. But ultimately, our strategy is to get more of our gas exposed to diverse market and to get our gas kind of offshore and exposed to the international markets. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Yacob for closing remarks. Ezra Yacob : We appreciate everyone's time today. Thank you to our shareholders for your support and especially thanks to our employees for delivering another exceptional quarter. Operator : The conference has now concluded.

Here\u2019s Ezra. Ezra Yacob : Thanks, Pearce. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Since the end of 2020, EOG has generated more than $22 billion of free cash flow and more than $25 billion in adjusted net income. We've increased our regular dividend rate 160% and including both regular and special dividends paid or committed to pay more than $13 billion directly to shareholders and $3.2 billion indirectly through share repurchases, all while reducing debt 35%. EOG has a history of delivering consistently strong financial and operational results, and the third quarter is simply more of the same. Led by our employees' commitment to operational excellence and capital discipline, we outperformed on oil, natural gas and NGL volumes for the quarter as well as beating expectations on per unit cash operating costs. We generated $1.6 billion of adjusted net income and $1.5 billion of free cash flow and returned $1.3 billion of that free cash flow back to our shareholders through a mix of our regular dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. In addition to announcing third quarter results yesterday, we demonstrated confidence in our ability to generate strong free cash flow in the future as well as our continued commitment to return a significant portion of cash to our shareholders by increasing the regular dividend 7% and boosting our share repurchase authorization by $5 billion. Cash return to shareholders begins with our focus on the regular dividend, which has never been reduced or suspended in the 27 years since we've been paying one, and it reflects our confidence in the increasing capital efficiency of our business going forward. And we continue to improve our capital efficiency by leveraging technology and innovation across both our foundational and emerging assets. That is one of the key advantages of operating in multiple basins. We are able to drive improvements to operational performance through technology transfer between those basins. We are drilling further and faster than at any time in our history, completing wells with fewer people and less equipment due to efficient operations, and we continue to capture additional value through our marketing strategy. EOG's performance is sustainable, because it's driven by our culture, empowering each employee to be a business person first, focusing on returns and seeking ways to improve the business every day. Our culture is our competitive advantage and combined with focus on sustainable value creation through the cycles, gives us confidence in our ongoing performance as we finish 2024 and position ourselves for 2025. In a moment, Jeff will provide some early commentary on our 2025 capital program, but our investment strategy always begins with capital discipline, balancing short and long-term free cash flow generation, return on capital employed and return of capital to shareholders. We also consider the macro environment in which we are operating. And currently, the overall macro environment remains dynamic. Oil inventory levels are below the five-year average with both supply and demand showing moderate growth year-over-year. We expect to finish 2024 with strong demand, slowing into a seasonally lower first quarter and then increasing throughout the rest of 2025. Domestically, while efficiency gains continue across the industry, we anticipate another year of slower US liquids growth grounded in the lower number of active drilling rigs and drilled but uncompleted wells. Regarding North American natural gas, inventory levels have moved closer to the five-year average throughout the year due to a combination of producer discipline and increased demand driven primarily by power generation. We remain optimistic on the long-term outlook for gas demand beginning in and increasing throughout 2025 from additional LNG projects coming online and ongoing increases in power generation. Finally, last month, we released our annual sustainability report for 2023, highlighting our leading environmental performance and commitment to safe operations. We achieved a GHG intensity rate below our 2025 target for the second year in a row and achieved a methane emissions percentage at/or below our 2025 target for the third consecutive year. Our in-house methane monitoring solution has progressed beyond the pilot phase and is integrated into our standard operating procedures. And our carbon capture and storage pilot project is operational, and we stand ready to deploy our learnings to future operations. Our consistent sustainability performance is a result of our empowered and collaborative workforce and our continued investment in innovation and technology to achieve not only leading environmental performance, but also strong and consistent safety performance throughout our operations. This year's report highlights our innovative culture that drives EOG's mission to be among the highest return, lowest cost and lowest emissions producers playing a significant role in the long-term future of energy. Now here's Ann with details on our financial performance. Ann Janssen : Thanks, Ezra. EOG continues to create long-term shareholder value. During the third quarter, we earned $1.6 billion of adjusted net income and generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow on $1.5 billion capital expenditures. Third quarter capital expenditures were in line with forecast, and we still expect our full year capital expenditures to be about $6.2 billion. Cash on the balance sheet at quarter end is temporarily higher due to the postponement of certain tax payments until the first quarter of next year from disaster relief granted for severe weather events in Texas, including Hurricane Barrel. Our ongoing marketing strategy to diversify and expand our access to premium markets also delivered exceptional results during the third quarter with peer-leading US price realizations of $76.95 per barrel of oil and $1.84 per Mcf for natural gas. Finally, we paid a $0.91 per share dividend and repurchased $758 million of shares during the quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated $4.1 billion of billion of free cash flow which helped fund $3.8 billion of cash returned to shareholders. Of that $3.8 billion, $1.6 billion was paid in regular dividends and was complemented by $2.2 billion in share repurchases through the third quarter. Taking into account our full year regular dividend, we have committed to return $4.3 billion to shareholders in 2024 and we are on track to exceed not only our minimum cash return commitment of 70% of annual free cash flow, but also last year's cash return of 85%. The EOG's commitment to high-return investments is delivering high returns to our shareholders. Yesterday, we were pleased to announce a 7% increase to what is already a top-tier regular dividend, not only for our industry but the broader market. This increase reflects our confidence in the fundamental strength of our business which continues to get better through consistent execution of EOG's value proposition. Efficiencies and technology applied throughout our multi-basin portfolio continue to sustainably improve EOG's capital efficiency. A growing sustainable regular dividend remains the foundation of our cash return commitment and we believe is the best indicator of the company's confidence in its future performance. In addition to the dividend increase, the Board approved a $5 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization to supplement the $1.8 billion remaining on the authorization as of quarter end. The total $6.8 billion buyback capacity retains our flexibility to deliver on our cash return commitment to shareholders. Over the last several quarters, we have favored buybacks to complement our regular dividend and we will continue to monitor the market for opportunities to step in and repurchase shares for the remainder of the year. EOG's balance sheet underpins the financial strength of the company and remains a strategic priority. To optimize EOG's capital structure going forward, we intend to position our balance sheet such that our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio equals less than one times at $45 WTI. We believe this is an efficient and prudent long-term capital structure for a cyclical industry that will support our commitment to deliver shareholder value. As a result, we anticipate refinancing upcoming debt maturities, increasing our debt balance to $5 billion to $6 billion range in the next 12 to 18 months and maintaining our cash balance at levels similar to what we have carried for the last two years. By managing our debt levels toward this more efficient capital structure, we are increasing our capacity to return cash to shareholders. Now here's Jeff to review operating results. Jeff Leitzell : Thanks, Ann. We delivered another outstanding quarter, thanks to our employees and their consistent execution across our multi-basin portfolio. Their focus on continued improvement through innovation, technology advancements and operational control is why our third quarter volumes and per unit cash operating costs beat expectations. Oil volumes beat our forecast, primarily due to better-than-expected productivity from new wells, driven by continuous improvement to our completion designs. Year-over-year, we have increased our maximum pumping rate capacity by approximately 15% per frac fleet on average. The benefit is twofold : Faster pump times and better well performance. Higher pumping rates provides our team with the flexibility to tailor each high-intensity completion design around the unique geological characteristics of every target. This, in turn, has helped to maximize the stimulated rock volume in the reservoir, resulting in improved well performance. Efficiency improvements due to faster pump times, combined with stronger well performance have more than offset the additional cost for these increased pumping rates. As a result of third quarter volume performance beats, we are once again raising full year guidance. Our oil production midpoint has increased by 800 barrels per barrels per day, natural gas liquids by 2,800 day and natural gas by 24 million standard cubic feet per day. We also beat per unit cash operating cost targets during the third quarter. The primary drivers were lower lease operating expense due to less workover expense and fuel savings. We now expect our full year per unit cash operating cost to be lower than forecasted and have reduced guidance accordingly. Our capital expenditures in the third quarter were in line with our forecast with only minor differences primarily due to timing of operations. In addition, well cost deflation driven primarily by efficiencies is playing out as we had forecasted at the start of the year, resulting in a 3% to 5% year-over-year decrease in well cost. As a result, our expectations for full year CapEx remain unchanged at $6.2 billion at the midpoint. The efficiency gains we continue to realize this year demonstrate the value of our multi-basin portfolio and decentralized structure. Ideas born in one operating area are replicated across multiple basins through technology transfer. Two examples of innovation, expanding through our portfolio and driving efficiencies this year are extended laterals and our in-house motor program. Average lateral lengths for our domestic drilling program continued to increase. In the Delaware Basin, we now expect to drill more than 70 3-mile laterals this year compared to our original forecast of 50. We've also set a new lateral length record in the Eagle Ford not only for EOG, but for all of Texas. Our Aspen A 1H well was drilled in our western acreage and has a lateral length of over 22,000 feet. As we highlighted last quarter, longer laterals allow for more time focused on drilling downhole and less time moving equipment on surface, decreasing overall downtime in days to drill. In addition, longer laterals help unlock new potential from acreage that might not otherwise meet our economic thresholds. EOG's in-house motor program also continues to pay dividends. In the Delaware Basin, we are testing the limits of our drilling motors in the shallower Leonard Shale and Bone Spring formations. While drilling the production hole section, we attempt to drill as much of the vertical curve and lateral portions of the wellbore with one motor run. Historically, this operation requires a minimum of three motor runs and two trips, which is a pause in drilling to pull a motor out of the wellbore and replace it with a new one. As a result, we have eliminated over one full trip per well in the shallower Delaware Basin targets. Given that each trip can cost $150,000 or more, the cost savings and efficiency gains from using better designed higher-quality motors continues to add significant value to our drilling program. This is just one of several examples of the value the EOG Motor program has created. Looking company-wide since the start of 2023, we have increased our drilled footage per motor run by over 20% versus third-party rental options. As we continue to test, learn, and redesign our drilling motors, we see substantial upside to our future drilling performance as we expand motor innovation throughout our multi-basin portfolio. In Ohio, we've made significant progress this year transitioning the 225,000 net acres of the volatile oil window in the Utica play from delineation into development. We now have five packages online and producing for more than 100 days, three of which have been producing well over 180 days. Both oil and liquids performance continues to meet or exceed expectations demonstrating the premium quality of this play. We are also capturing sustainable operational efficiencies through multi-well pad development and continuous operations. On the drilling side, the Utica provides an ideal operational environment to make significant gains quickly. We have decreased drilling days to drill three-mile laterals 29% year-over-year and have already achieved a record of drilling more than two miles in a single day. We also have made significant gains on the completion side, achieving a nearly 13% increase in completed lateral feet per day compared to last year. Over the next few years, activity in the Utica will continue to be primarily focused in the volatile oil window, where we anticipate our well costs will average less than $650 per effective treated lateral foot with finding cost and development costs in the range of $6 to $8 per barrel of oil equivalent. For 2025, we anticipate a 50% increase in Utica activity as we continue to leverage consistent operations to achieve additional economies of scale. Our large contiguous acreage position lends itself to developing a long-life, repeatable, low-cost play competitive with the premier unconventional plays across North America. Previewing 2025 company-wide, with the outstanding performance we have delivered this year, we do not see a need to significantly adjust activity next year. We do, however, expect very minor shifts in activity between basins with a continued increase in activity in the Utica and another year of actively managing our Dorado investment with a one-rig program. This will allow us to continue to capture some economies of scale across our emerging assets and advance our technological understanding of these plays while delivering the operational and financial performance that our shareholders appreciate. Now, here's Ezra to wrap up. Ezra Yacob : Thanks Jeff. EOG recently celebrated our 25th anniversary as an independently traded public company. And while many things have changed across our industry, EOG's fundamental strategy and commitment to creating share value for our shareholders has remained consistent. First, our commitment to capital discipline begins with reinvestment at a pace to support continuous improvement across our assets delivering returns through the cycle, generating free cash flow, and maintaining a pristine balance sheet to support a sustainable growing regular dividend. Second, our strong operational execution begins with being a first mover in exploration to maintain a low-cost, high-quality multi-basin inventory. We leverage in-house technical expertise proprietary information technology and self-sourced materials help drive well performance and cost control, and we focus on a balanced approach to product, geographic, and pricing diversification to drive margin expansion. Third, we are committed to safe operations, leading environmental performance and stakeholder engagement. Our sustainability report highlights progress on our emissions reduction pathway, as well as overall environmental stewardship. And finally, our culture is our competitive advantage. A decentralized non-bureaucratic organization places value creation in the field at the asset level and in the hands of each of our employees. We take pride in our collaborative, multidisciplinary teams that drive innovation, utilizing our technology and real-time data collection to drive decision-making. Thanks for listening. Now we will go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Steve Richardson with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Steve Richardson : Hi, good morning. I was wondering, if we could start as the optimization of the balance sheet. This is a new wrinkle from the company. And I wonder, if you could just talk about this incremental gross debt that you're looking at adding the time frame? Should we think about that $2 billion coming concurrent when you would look to refi the existing maturities? And then also the knock-on of that is -- how do you look at redeploying that cash, assuming into the buyback? And does this mean that you'll be taking shareholder returns above, sustainably above that minimum commitment for the next couple of quarters. Maybe just talk about time frame around that, please? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Steve. Good morning. Thanks for the question. The decision is aimed at really just making our capital structure more efficient. We're moving to a level of debt that's more appropriate for a company of our size and strength, still being respectful that we're in a cyclical industry. Ultimately, the move is designed to allow us to move more equity into the debt side. We've always talked about we've been pretty consistent, but the goal of our company has never been to get to a zero absolute debt. And so really, the timing right now looks pretty good as we have a couple of bonds coming into maturity in the next 12 18 months, the market is looking a little more favorable than it has in the last few quarters. And so as we step into this -- as we talked about, as Ann mentioned, our debt target will be to keep total debt to EBITDA at less than one times, leverage ratio at a $45 WTI, which if you calculate that out is approximately a $5 billion to $6 billion range. And so you're right, that will free up some additional cash. And really, what I would look for is, yes, in the near-term, that does imply that we'll definitely be in a position to exceed the 70% commitment and quite frankly, be closer to 100% and at times, more than 100% of return of free cash flow to the shareholders. But I want to put a more specific time target on it other than the next 12-month time frame, the next 12 to 15 months is we look to be opportunistic in the market, not only with share repurchases, but also the timing of reaching out on these bonds. Steve Richardson : That's great. Really strong choice capital allocation. Thanks. If I could maybe just a follow-up on natural gas. You have arguably the lowest cost dry gas asset in the market and with the Verde Pipeline finishing, you've got some real opportunities here. I appreciate the comments on a 1-rig program for 2025, but you mentioned off the top as how optimistic the natural gas demand outlook looks. So how should we think about the contango of the gas curve and what signal you're looking for to apply more capital there, arguably that you are at the low end of the cost curve in North America? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Steve, that's another great question on Dorado. We've highlighted last quarter that cash operating costs are right around that $1 already for the asset. And so we do consider it to be one of the lowest cost natural gas projects in all of the US and very well positioned. Verde is online, which we're very excited about. But the North American gas inventory, as you said, is it's currently about 5% above the five-year average still. And we'll see what happens with winter. But either way, whether it's warm or cold, the industry does appear to have not only some curtailed volumes, but there is also some gas DUCs that will likely come online pretty quickly. And so what we see -- and this is somewhat in line with where we've been for the last two years is that 2025 is really going to be an inflection point for North American gas demand with LNG beginning to come online and then coming online really 2025, 2026 2027. And when we think about that, it's -- as we calculated about 10 to 12 Bcf a day of LNG that's under construction and should come online in that time frame. And then above and beyond that, we actually see another almost 10 to 12 Bcf a day in demand growth between now and the end of the decade, that's really associated with power demand, a little bit of industrial, some Mexico exports, but really, it's power demand driven not only by new power demand from AI and electrification, but also coal power retirements. And so our goal with Dorado is to continue to invest at a pace where we can capture some of the economies of scale, as Jeff talked about, which in the last two years has really been a 1-rig program. And as the market starts to open up for us, we'd like to increase that. The next kind of critical point in these unconventional plays is to get to a continuous completion spread. But we're very excited about where we can go and the asset that we've captured there. Operator : And our next question today will come from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Securities LLC. Please go ahead. Arun Jayaram : Yes, good morning. Ezra, I was wondering if we could talk about puts and takes in terms of 2025 capital. Jeff mentioned, that you expect to run relatively flattish activity but with the movements between some basins. So I was wondering if you could kind of characterize how capital would move. You're going to be a little bit more active at Dorado, we think, in the Utica I think your strategic infrastructure spend is going to go down on a year-over-year basis, and there's obviously some of the efficiency gains that Jeff was highlighting. Jeff Leitzell : Yes, Arun, this is Jeff. Yes. Thanks for the question. So yes, as you talked about, and we talked about in our opening comments, the plan right now, which is still early, is to maintain relatively flat activity next year and those minor shifts, I mean, they're going to be fairly small. I mean a few wells here and there and pretty immaterial across the portfolio, which will lead to the modest increase in activity we talked about in the Utica. So what I'd first say is just about our current program and the activity levels we're at, we're extremely happy with the progress we've made. And the improvements we've seen across the whole portfolio by really focusing on that. And where we're at now is really we want to focus on the emerging plays and really getting them to that critical activity level to maximize our efficiencies, which the first step in that is getting it to one full drilling rig. And then really, the next hurdle is going to be getting those plays to one full frac fleet. So in the Utica, as we've touched on, we should be there next year. We're looking at about a 50% increase in activity. We'll be up to two full rigs and one full frac fleet by year-end. So we'll reach those critical points. And then Dorado, which you talk about we really anticipate maintaining just the one full rig that we've been running. We've been seeing outstanding performance and efficiencies from that consistent operations. But we'll continue to manage the investments in our completion activity just as we watch the natural gas market and move through the winter. So I think by doing all this, this really allows us to continue progress each one of those emerging plays, but we'll still be able to deliver another year of strong results from the portfolio. And then just real quick on infrastructure. You did hit on it. Over the last few years, we've had a little bit of additional infrastructure spend that was strategic with the Janus gas plant and the Verde pipeline. This year, it was around $400 million. And looking forward to 2025, really, we just -- we're going to be finishing up that Janus plant and a few little things from a facilities aspect on the Verde pipeline. So we expect strategic spend there next year to be somewhere around $100 million. And then as those continue to roll off and we look in the future, we'll start moving back towards that 15% to kind of 20% indirect level. Arun Jayaram : Got it. That's helpful. Maybe just a follow-up to Steve's question on the optimization of the balance sheet. You mentioned Azure that this could maybe drive higher cash returns to investors. How much does the potential to do A&D or bolt-ons, countercyclical A&D? How did that progress in terms of your thinking terms of going to $5 billion $6 billion of gross debt? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Arun, this is Ezra. Yes, I mean, I think you're right. While we're going to be making our capital structure more efficient, we'll be very well positioned still to have what we consider industry's leading balance sheet, quite frankly. And that does going to preserve -- it's going to preserve the financial strength of the business for us. That will give us the ability to still maintain the ability to continue to invest in countercyclic, low-cost property bolt-ons, other things that we've done in the past along those same lines. And what I would say is the ability to return more than 100% of annual free cash flow the near term and deliver more cash to shareholders over time, it's really just an effect of, again, shifting some of the equity into the debt side. Where we're starting at today is such a position of strength with a cash positive position that even leveraging up on this debt side, it still puts us in a great position to be able to continue to execute on a lot of our priorities. Like I said, including low-cost property bolt-ons to be able to be in a position to opportunistically step into larger share repurchases if the opportunity presents itself. And so we really see this as a very shareholder-friendly maneuver that we're doing. And like I said, the timing of it is really just what we kind of see in the market and the fact that we do have some of the bonds maturing. Operator : And our next question today will come from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Scott Hanold : Thanks. And I'm going to hit on the balance sheet optimization. And as you just sort of answered part of my question there with regards to like the why now. It's definitely unique to the sector. And just kind of curious, was this a decision you've been contemplating for some time. Kind of what was the catalyst to move on it now? And also with respect to that, how much value creation from shifting to a lower cost capital structure like moving from equity to debt, some of that value. How much of a value improvement do you expect to see from that? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Scott, this is Ezra again. So, on the strategic portion, and then maybe I'll hand over to Ann to get in a little bit more of the mechanics. But yes, I think this is really in line with where the management and Board has been thinking for a long time. As I started off the Q&A session with Steve, I mentioned that I think we've been pretty consistent talking about the goal of the company has never been to go to an absolute zero debt level. But really, we like to be positioned to create long-term shareholder value and having different measures -- different abilities to do that. One thing that we love about having that pristine balance sheet that I should have just mentioned when speaking with Arun is also the peer leading regular dividend that we have. And this gives us confidence in being able to continue to grow that and maintain that dividend. As I said in my opening remarks, it's been 27 years that we've been paying that dividend without ever needing to suspend it or cut it. And that's something we're very proud about. So, we really look at the entire priority of our cash flows when we were thinking about this. And the trigger again, that's caused it right now is just where we're at in the macro environment. And not from the commodity side, but really from the financial side. If you recall, Scott, the last bond that we retired was about a $1.2 billion bond back in Q1 of 2023. And that was right decision at the time for us, but one of the reasons is not only were interest rates climbing at that time, but as we all recall, there was a -- what turned out to be a rather somewhat small banking crisis at the time, felt like it could maybe possibly balloon into something larger. So, we refinanced that -- or I'm sorry, we paid that off with cash on hand. And essentially, since then, interest rates have always been climbing up until the recent last couple of quarters where things have kind of plateaued, and we're starting to see them bend over a little bit. So, those are really the things that have kind of given us the confidence to kind of go ahead and make this decision now. As far as moving the equity onto the debt side and the impact for us, I'll hand that off to Ann. Ann Janssen : Yes. The way we look at it is the optimal capital structure is one where the balance sheet has more debt than what we have today. So, basically, we're looking at putting on a level of debt that is more appropriate for our company of our size and strength in this point in the cyclical industry. So, if you want to look at those parameters as we mentioned, first, we wanted to be less than 1 times total debt to EBITDA leverage ratio at approximate bottom cycle prices around $45. And if you compute that out, that gives us a yield of total debt level of about $5 billion to $6 billion. Conversely, if you look at the cash side of the business, as we look at the appropriate level of cash, we think that's currently about the level we've held for the last two years. We need about a minimum of $2 billion in cash to run the business on a daily basis. And then that additional cash allows us to backstop the regular dividend as well as support additional cash return and take advantage of those countercyclical opportunities. So, again, echoing Azar's comments, our main objective is just to create long-term value for our shareholders. And we think setting up the balance sheet the way we are, will better position us to have an appropriate level of cash to run the business, continue to make those investments as they present themselves and backs up our regular dividend through the cycle. Scott Hanold : Understood. Thanks. My follow-up is a little bit on the election. The outcomes certainly have created a lot of volatility in the markets. And as you look at what this means to the energy industry and specifically for EOG. What are some of your initial kind of takeaways and the potential tailwinds at play? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Scott. We still got obviously, the presidential and the Senate is getting close to -- you can kind of see who's going to control those two portions of our Congress and then we'll see where the house finishes up after that. I think for us, what we really prepare for is kind of this next couple of months. Whenever there's a change of administration, this is the time period when we really start to focus in, maybe take some steps to prepare just in case things can slow down. So we're feeling very good very good with where we're at right now. As far as going forward on the industry, I think the industry has come a long way as far as our relationship with not only at the federal level, but really at the local level, working alongside policymakers, regulators and such. And I think the industry is in a spot to continue the performance that we've had over the last few years. When I know I can speak a little more directly for EOG but in the areas that we operate, even the new areas like in Ohio with our Utica play, we've really developed an outstanding relationship. I think many across industry policymakers, really just stakeholders, in general, see that there is a long -- that oil and natural gas are going to play a long -- are going to play a part of the long-term energy solution. And that working with the industry is really the best way kind of achieve the goals of low cost, reliable and lower emissions type of energy sources. Operator : And our next question today will come from Leo Mariani with ROTH. Please go ahead. Leo Mariani : Hey, guys. Wanted to just touch base a little bit here on the Utica again. So just curious, you guys talked about $6 to $8 a BOE. I think that was exclusive to the volatile oil window. Do you think there's room to kind of continue to get costs down over time? I know you guys have talked about a long-term goal of BOE finding cost, but I think that may have included some of the gassier windows as well. So where are you at in the cost cycle in the Utica? And do you think there's still significant room to take that down? Keith Trasko : Yes, Leo, this is Keith. The finding cost range, yes, you're right. It is specific to the volatile oil window and the 225,000 net acres we have there. The range represents the expectations for the next two to three years of development. That's the same for the well cost range. If you back out science on some of our early wells, we've hit the upper end of this range multiple times, and we'll continue to drive it down with the economies of scale. Versus the $5 finding costs we previously disclosed, that reflects the entire 445,000 acre field. That includes the up-dip oil window and the down-dip condensate window. It also incorporates full field development. So we still see line of sight to that, but what we're doing here is giving more guidance in the near-term. Overall, we've made great progress in the play, the well productivity and well cost continue to demonstrate the premium quality and it really highlights our organic exploration strategy. Leo Mariani : Okay. Appreciate that. I wanted to see if there was any update on the PRB. I feel like it's been a little time since we've kind of heard on that. How are you kind of viewing that play in terms of how it stacks up against others? And I think you're doing a little bit less on the well side this year than you did last year. You talked about adding a little bit of activity in the Utica for 2025. Just kind of any update in terms of how the PRB is performing and how you're kind of thinking about future activity levels there? Jeff Leitzell : Yeah, Leo, this is Jeff. So yes, the powder is progressing nicely. As we've talked about for the past handful of years, we've really been focused on the Mowry formation, which is the deeper formation and really kind of lining out our geologic model and what our development plans are there, and we had really good success with it. So shifted over since we've gotten all that overlying geologic data in the Niobrara to where we're really doing a split program this year of about 25 wells split between the more and the Niobrara. And what I would say is we've applied the new geologic models and we're continuing to refine our completion techniques up there. And through the first part of the year, we brought on some of those diabera wells. And I mean, results are very early right now, but they're very encouraging. We are seeing an uptick of greater than probably about 10% increase in productivity versus 2023 in the Niobrara. So moving forward right now, I think we're in a very comfortable spot. We still have little to learn there in the Niobrara and kind of just our development patterns and when to offset in depletion and space. And so I think we're probably going to be pretty consistent with our program as we move into 2025 as we continue to refine those models. Operator : And our next question today will come from Kalei Akamine with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kalei Akamine : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for getting me on. My first question is on the gas guide. So we've seen it go up every single quarter this year, and we think that, that's the Permian. I appreciate that the Janus plant is coming online. But I'm wondering if that gas outperformance pulls forward any of your additional midstream development time lines? Jeff Leitzell : Yeah, Kalei, this is Jeff and no, our plans are pretty secure as far as that goes. And really, there shouldn't be any advancement. I mean all of any of the kind of midstream or I should say, strategic infrastructure projects that we've talked about. I mean, they're on time and they're on pace to come online when we expected. With the Janus gas plant, as we've talked about, the plan is to complete that next year. So as we talked about, we'll have a little bit of strategic infrastructure dollars associated with that, about $100 million. But other than that, no, there will be really no acceleration in any of those projects. Kalei Akamine : Got it. For my follow-up, I'd like to go back to Dorado. I appreciate that it's got very low cash costs. I think in the past, we've talked about $1, and that falling by $0.50 to $0.60 because of Verde. And sort of given its position on the coast, I imagine that it's going to be quite a resilient play. My question is, are you going to optimize production around that cash cost figure? Or do you think that there is a return threshold to consider that would cause you to maybe curtail production or maybe decelerate? Ezra Yacob : Yeah, Kalei, this is Ezra. Dorado, the way we look at Dorado, quite frankly, is similar to the way that we invest in any of our basins, and it starts with the returns profile. Are we investing at the right pace to optimize the returns and the ultimate NPV of that asset. And quite frankly, what we found in Dorado, especially with its location there close to the demand center coupled with some of the strategic decisions we've been able to make on the marketing side is that this dry gas play from an economics perspective really competes with many of our oil plays. And so that's really what governs how quickly that we invest into that play. On the lower level, as we've talked about with any of these unconventional resources or these emerging assets, we like to try and get to these critical points of where you capture the economies of scale. So, the first is consistent rigs. The second point would be a consistent completion spread where you're not mobilizing in and out of basin, a lot of crews and things like that. It gives you the ability to really know the crew that you're working with and the equipment and you can really start to leverage the learnings. On the upper end of it, you can definitely outrun your pace of investment there and your ability to learn on each well and make each well a little bit better, whether it's finding cost or well performance. And then layered on top of that, obviously, is the macro environment. Now we've done a great job with Dorado by strategically allowing that gas to reach multiple markets. It's got multiple outlets and it's well-positioned along the Gulf Coast like we said. And so that does bring to it an inherent opportunity to continue to deliver that gas. And we think that it will be a significant portion of the future supply that should grow into the North American growing gas demand. Operator : And our next question today will come from Neal Dingmann with Truist. Please go ahead. Neal Dingmann : Thanks for the time guys. I'm hoping I can ask another one on the Utica specifically. I'd love to hear your latest thoughts on how you're thinking about the prospectivity more on the west side of the play, either in that black oil or volatile oil in the play? And then just one other question on this play. What's the latest on just the decline? I know it's still early, but I'm just wondering are these wells declining more like typical oil wells or like a Marcellus gas well? Keith Trasko : Yes. This is this is Keith. On the prospectivity overall, we are still focused mainly on the volatile oil window and trying to dial down spacing there. We will eventually jump up to the west side or to the -- also to the condensate window at some point. We're still in the data-gathering phase there. On the decline side, I'd say we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary. It's a combo play, and we see the declines like a typical tight shale well similar to the Eagle Ford. Neal Dingmann : Got it. Okay. Okay. And then maybe just a second one, a follow-up just on overall inventory. I'm just wondering, I understand no longer put out the well count in your slides like you previously had in the appendix. I'm just wondering -- I was hoping you could give a sense or maybe a ballpark of how many years you're thinking about of running room specifically in the Del, Eagle Ford, and Bakken at the current rig paces. Ezra Yacob : Yes, Neal, this is Ezra. What we do disclose is our resource potential in -- as far as resource and we've continued to show that we've got about 10 billion barrels of equivalents the premium resource multi-basin portfolio. The ones that you're highlighting are -- it's an interesting collection because you've got a mix of kind of -- those are foundational plays, but they're all at different kind of legacy aspects. So, in the Bakken, we run basically a one-rig program, and we're at a point where we feel that we can continue to do that and generate similar returns for a number of years to come. In the Eagle Ford, many things have changed in the Eagle Ford, and I think everyone has seen that we've slowed down our pace of investment kind of just for lack of a better data point, say, pre-COVID until post-COVID, where these days, we put the sales maybe 120 wells to sales every year or something like that. And again, the slowing down of that investment, it's less about the inventory that we have remaining, and it's more about what I was speaking with Kalei about as far as investing in each of these plays at the right pace. Slowing down there in the Eagle Ford, we've actually increased the returns and expanded the margin profile, and that's really the thing that we focus on. And then in the last one that I would mention is the Delaware Basin, of course, to be honest with the Delaware Basin, I think it's difficult. Industry has done a lot of drilling there over the past decade. But with the technology advancements, I think industry continues to unlock especially on the Delaware Basin side, unlock additional targets every year. And so to be quite honest, it's a little bit difficult to quantify just how much inventory would be left in such a robust resource as the Delaware Basin. You're talking about literally a miles worth of oil and gas saturated reservoirs in that basin. And so we feel very good about the premium resource that we have in place. We've got a very high-quality, very deep bench of assets across multiple basins. And really at the pace that we're operating in the last couple of years and where the macro environment looks right now, inventory is lack of inventory is not really something that we really ever makes our radar. What we continue to look for is improving the quality of that inventory through our organic exploration efforts which is one of the things that's driven the success there in Utica. Operator : And our next question today will come from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead. Charles Meade : Yes. Good morning. Congrats to you and your whole team there. I wanted to go back to your prepared comments, you spoke a bit about the commodity macro. And you gave a thought on the U.S. supply picture. But I wonder if you could kind of share with us your point of view on what the range of possible outcomes is for 2025? And not that we're looking for specific prediction, but more of just trying to get an understanding of your thinking that's informing your approach to 2025? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Charles, let me give you a little more background on that. As you guys know, we kind of build our models. We start internally with the things that we know best, which are operationally in the field. And so the biggest thing that is driving our kind of U.S. numbers. And just for historical 2023, I think the U.S. was about 1.5 million barrels liquids growth. Last year, or I'm sorry, this year, it's looking more like it's going to be right around half of that, maybe about 700,000. And so in 2025, we see a little bit less than that, even moderated growth off of that number for the U.S. And it really begins with where the rig counts are at and where the oily drilled, but uncompleted well levels are at. Both of those are relatively low. And on the rig count side, it hasn't really moved. The rig count really hasn't moved in just about a year now. And so that's really the biggest thing that's informing our expectation for slightly less growth year-over-year in the U.S. Charles Meade : Got it. Got it. And then could you give us a quick rundown of how or how we're went to meet our 2025 program? Ezra Yacob : I'm sorry, Charles, you broke up there. I didn't catch that. How or when -- what was it? Charles Meade : Beehive, the Australia well. Ezra Yacob : Yes, sir. Yes, Jeff? Jeff Leitzell : Yes. Charles, this is Jeff. Yes. So we have secured the permit there, and we're really excited to be testing prospect. The plan is to test it next year. So obviously, it's an oil prospect. It's a large untested structure there. It's really close to markets, and it's there on the Northwest Shelf of Australia. So the thing that I'd really point out is it's a prospect that's very similar in water depth and operations, the environment, I should say is Trinidad. So we'll really be able to leverage all that shallow water expertise that we have there. So at this time right now, we've got a team in place there in Australia, and we're excited to go ahead and test that prospect sometime next year. Operator : And our next question today will come from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Scott Gruber : Yes, good morning. You guys have mentioned keeping activity largely consistent for 2025. Your oil volumes will be up about 2% year-on-year at the exit this year. Is that a number, we should be expecting kind of a similar figure for 2025? And then obviously, there's some concerns on the macro side. Just curious, just under what conditions would you look to dial back activity to ensure more of a flattish trend on your oil production? Ezra Yacob : Yeah, Scott, this is Ezra. Like you said, it's -- I don't think we're at this point ready to talk about a percentage there on 2025, but you can go ahead and count on what we've talked about today with similar activity levels. I mean, the way to really think about our capital allocation is it's not a -- it doesn't begin with that growth number. It really is an output of our investment strategy. And as you highlighted, we're not really growing that much right now. I mean I think in the last 12 months, we've grown about 10,000 barrels of oil per day, which for a 490,000 barrel of oil per day company is really pretty soft. It's certainly something that we could grow more aggressively if we want to focus on it. But quite frankly, what we focus on is we invest balance returns, NPV, free cash flow generation in both the short and long-term and how we can best return that cash to shareholders. That's really the focus of our disciplined investment strategy. And when we get it correct in each of our plays, you invest at the right pace as we've talked about today, that's when you really start to realize the operational efficiencies, the cost reductions and the performance improvement that Jeff really highlighted in his opening comments, so that's what you should expect for us. When we think about the success this year of managing the investment in that way and how we manage our portfolio, the exceptional results that we're seeing across our wells, I think in just the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford alone are foundational plays. The wells that came on production in first half of 2024 actually paid back their capital investment in aggregate by July 1st. And those results are the types that are flowing straight through to the shareholders because in the first nine months of the year, we've been able to return 92% of that free cash flow to our shareholders. So that's really the way that we approach it. As far as what scenario would we do something dramatically different, we do have the flexibility to either increase or slow down our activity level. We have put out at the beginning of this year, that three-year scenario, which provides a little bit of -- I don't want to call it guidance, but it gives you some scenarios between a $65 to $85 range and the type of financial performance that we could expect if we invested it at similar levels to what we're talking about today. And you can see even at a $65 case, it's a very compelling investment scenario where we've got a low reinvestment rate, 6%, I think, is the cash flow and free cash flow growth per share, which doesn't include any share repurchases. You're talking about a 20% to 30% double-digit ROCE and free cash flow generation, not only to support our regular dividend, but excess free cash flow to support either additional special dividends or opportunistic share repurchases as well. Scott Gruber : I appreciate all that color. I had a follow-up on your carbon capture initiative. With the pilot project up and running, can you speak to your interest in doing additional projects and would these be confined to internal projects? Or would you consider third-party projects? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Scott, that's a good question. Right now, we view our carbon capture and storage projects as something internal to help our operations and focus on that. We've had good success with our pilot project, as I talked about just briefly in the opening. And it's really just turning into more of a standard piece of our business. And we are starting to look for other opportunities across our portfolio where we might be able to deploy that technology. But as far as looking at gathering third party or something like that, we've looked at it and evaluated it. But like most things, the real value for much of the technology that we develop is usually better kept inside. Operator : And our next question today will come from Kevin MacCurdy with Pickering Energy Partners. Please go ahead. Kevin MacCurdy : Hi, good morning. I think the market is appreciating the reconsideration of your capital structure. My question is on how dynamic do you plan to be on managing that capital structure? As EBITDA grows with higher production and better margins over time, it seems like you should have a more of a safety net on the downside leverage target. Would you keep \u2013 would you plan to keep returning a higher percentage of your free cash flow in the future, even if that moves you to a net debt position? Ann Janssen : Hi, Kevin, it's Ann. We're in a good place now. We have such a strong balance sheet that the level of debt we want to carry and the amount of cash we want to carry has some flexibility built into it. So that's the good side of it. So as we're looking at how to return that free cash flow, we're going to stay in line with what our fundamentals are and how we want to return our free cash flow. We have the cash priorities schedule on how we look at just cash on the balance sheet and how we want to return that to shareholders. And as far as the debt level we want to carry, we're comfortable going to a higher debt level, if that's what makes sense for the business at the time. But again, we have a lot of flexibility in managing those components, and we will move forward based on what the business needs are at the time. Kevin MacCurdy : Yes. I mean it seems like you highlighted the near-term shareholder return benefit, but this structure could set you up for potentially even higher percentage of returns in the future. I guess my follow-up here is, you mentioned low cost property bolt-ons as part of your balance sheet plans. Do you have any color on where you see the most opportunities for that? And what is the dollar threshold between a low-cost bolt-on and significant M&A, which you've kind of avoided in the past? Ezra Yacob : Yes, Kevin, this is Ezra. That's a good question. It's not really defined, I think as far as a low-cost property bolt-on or significant merger and acquisition. I mean, I think on the one end, everybody knows what a significant M&A would be. It would be something corporate of magnitude like that. Really, the way we think about it is on the value driver. And so maybe that's the best way to answer it is low PDP with high upside on drilled acreage is what we really look for. And that high upside on undrilled acreage typically comes on emerging assets, to be perfectly honest, because if you're buying quality of acreage in a play that's known and it's going to be additive to the quality of our inventory, odds are you're going to be paying a big premium for that, and that's going to erode your long-term margins, not your wellhead rates of return, but your full cycle margins. So that's really what we look on. And I think that also kind of speaks to where you're at with where are the opportunities for that. Typically, we find those opportunities more often than not in some of the emerging assets, just because, again, we tend -- we think we have the ability to potentially identify and unlock value that maybe gets bypassed by others. And when you think about building out our inventory that way and continuing to improve the quality our inventory, that goes a long way to what you were just implying as far as the long-term return benefit with this capital structure. As you've seen, quite frankly, in the last couple of years is our emerging plays as we've gained more confidence in those, and those have come to fruition, we've increased the percentage of cash return from just below 70% -- down around 60% to making our commitment 70% to last year and this year basically at or exceeding 85% of the free cash flow. So as the strength of business overall improves from the operational performance, that's what ultimately flows through to the financial performance. Operator : This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ezra Yacob for any closing remarks. Ezra Yacob : We appreciate everyone's time today. I just want to say thank you to our shareholders for your support and special thanks to our employees for delivering another exceptional quarter. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
